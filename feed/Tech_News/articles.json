As the name suggests, this latest device is another version of the Pebble smartwatch, but with a rounded screen, giving it a more upscale look. But like other Pebble devices, the new watch is still an affordable purchase at $199. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble keeps its smartwatches’ cost down by limiting what they can do. In the case of the new Pebble Round 2, the device offers basic health and activity tracking, like steps and sleep, but it doesn’t include a heart rate monitor or other features that would make it a fitness or sports watch alternative. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tradeoff is longer battery life — the Pebble Round 2 should last 10 to 14 days before needing a charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pebbles-smartwatch-is-back-pebble-time-2-specs-revealed/\">recently launched Pebble Time 2</a>, the Pebble Round 2 is the company’s reboot of an older smartwatch. Back in 2015, Pebble launched its first rounded watch with the Pebble Time Round, which the company called the industry’s thinnest smartwatch at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newer version maintains that slim look, at just 8.1mm in thickness, compared with the original’s 7.5mm. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079415\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png 2947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=1200,655 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=1280,699 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=430,235 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=720,393 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=900,491 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=800,437 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=1536,839 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=2048,1118 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=668,365 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=1130,617 1130w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=708,387 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[The Pebble Time Round] was, by far, one of my favorite Pebbles, but it wasn’t perfect,” said Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky in an interview with TechCrunch. “It had a few things we could improve, most notably being the gigantic bezel around the edge.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make the original rounded watch face, the team had used an octagonal piece of glass with rounded edges that were hidden by a large bezel. But the result was a device that didn’t have a very large screen. Technology has since improved, of course, so the new device’s larger screen allows you to see more text. The updated design looks better, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The touchscreen is now a 1.3″ color e-paper display (260 x 260 pixels at 283 DPI — or twice as many pixels as the original Pebble Time Round). The screen has a backlight, too, so you can see it at night. Under the hood, the Round 2 runs the open source Pebble OS. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079414\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png 3151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=300,102 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=768,261 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=680,231 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=1200,408 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=1280,435 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=430,146 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=720,245 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=900,306 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=800,272 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=1536,523 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=2048,697 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=668,227 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=1440,490 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=708,241 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=50,17 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The watch’s dual microphones, meanwhile, allow for speech input and replying to messages. (This is currently an Android-only feature, because of Apple’s restrictions. But iOS will be supported in the EU in the days ahead.)  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The side buttons let you do things like silence incoming calls, play and pause music, navigate, go back, and scroll. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky says one advantage of buttons is that they allow you to use the watch without having to look down.  “Say, for example, someone’s calling, and you’re in a meeting, and you just don’t want to answer the call,” he said. “You don’t even want to look at your watch. You always know that the bottom button cancels the call. Or if you’re listening to music and you’ve got AirPods in and you don’t want to fiddle with the AirPods or look at your phone, you always know that the center button pauses music.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079412\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The watch also has a stainless steel frame, accelerometer, and magnetometer, and includes a silicone watch band and a Pebble charge dongle. Leather bands will be made available separately. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are three watch color options to choose from, but each supports different band sizes. The matte black has a 20mm quick-release band; the silver supports either a 14mm or 20mm band; and the polished rose gold supports only the 14mm band. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pebble Round 2 can run thousands of apps and watch faces available on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/watchfaces\">Pebble Appstore</a>, though developers will need to update their apps to support the rounded screen using the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.repebble.com/sdk/\">provided SDK</a>. Among the apps that can be accessed are AI assistants, like those that support <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/68fe94c3d004720009e0b41a?section=watchapps\">Claude</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/64853961143b6504611fbc06?query=claude%C2%A7ion=watchapps\">other popular assistants</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble is also working on AI features for its devices. The company recently launched an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/\">AI smart ring</a> that can record audio and transcribe conversations. When asked, Migicovsky said functionality similar to what’s in the ring will later come to Pebble watches, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Pebble Round 2 will be available for pre-order on January 2 from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://repebble.com/\">Pebble’s website</a>. It should ship in May. Customers who previously ordered the Pebble Time 2 will also have the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://orders.rePebble.com\">option to switch</a> to the Pebble Round 2 if they choose.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The approach was computationally expensive, but made possible with GPUs. The result? A decade of hardcore AI research as scientists worked to invent new architectures for different tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That culminated around 2020 when OpenAI launched GPT-3, which showed how simply making the model 100 times bigger unlocks abilities like coding and reasoning without requiring explicit training. This marked the transition into what Kian Katanforoosh, CEO and founder of AI agent platform Workera, calls the “age of scaling”: a period defined by the belief that more compute, more data, and larger transformer models would inevitably drive the next major breakthroughs in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, many researchers think the AI industry is beginning to exhaust the limits of scaling laws and will once again transition into an age of research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yann LeCun, Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/11/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-reportedly-plans-to-leave-to-build-his-own-startup/\">former chief AI scientist</a>, has long argued against the over-reliance on scaling, and stressed the need to develop better architectures. And Sutskever said in a recent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever-2\">interview</a> that current models are plateauing and pre-training results have flattened, indicating a need for new ideas.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think most likely in the next five years, we are going to find a better architecture that is a significant improvement on transformers,” Katanforoosh said. “And if we don’t, we can’t expect much improvement on the models.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sometimes-less-is-more\">Sometimes less is more</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large language models are great at generalizing knowledge, but many experts say the next wave of enterprise AI adoption will be driven by smaller, more agile language models that can be fine-tuned for domain-specific solutions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fine-tuned SLMs will be the big trend and become a staple used by mature AI enterprises in 2026, as the cost and performance advantages will drive usage over out-of-the-box LLMs,” Andy Markus, AT&amp;T’s chief data officer, told TechCrunch. “We’ve already seen businesses increasingly rely on SLMs because, if fine-tuned properly, they match the larger, generalized models in accuracy for enterprise business applications, and are superb in terms of cost and speed.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve seen this argument before from French open-weight AI startup Mistral: it argues its small <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/mistral-closes-in-on-big-ai-rivals-with-mistral-3-open-weight-frontier-and-small-models/\">models actually perform better</a> than larger models on several benchmarks after fine-tuning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability of SLMs make them ideal for tailored applications where precision is paramount,” said Jon Knisley, an AI strategist at ABBYY, an Austin-based enterprise AI company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Markus thinks SLMs will be key in the agentic era, Knisley says the nature of small models means they’re better for deployment on local devices, “a trend accelerated by advancements in edge computing.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-learning-through-experience\">Learning through experience</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design.png?w=680\" alt=\"Space ship environment created in Marble with text prompt overlayed.

But LLMs don’t really understand the world; they just predict the next word or idea. That’s why many researchers believe the next big leap will come from world models: AI systems that learn how things move and interact in 3D spaces so they can make predictions and take actions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Signs that 2026 will be a big year for world models are multiplying. LeCun left Meta to start his own world model lab, and is reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/yann-lecun-confirms-his-new-world-model-startup-reportedly-seeks-5b-valuation/\">seeking a $5 billion valuation</a>. Google’s DeepMind has been plugging away at Genie, and in August launched its latest model that builds real-time interactive general-purpose world models. Alongside demos by startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/decarts-ai-simulates-a-real-time-playable-version-of-minecraft/\">Decart</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/odysseys-new-ai-model-streams-3d-interactive-worlds/\">Odyssey</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\">Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs</a> has launched its first commercial world model, Marble. Newcomers like General Intuition in October scored a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/general-intuition-lands-134m-seed-to-teach-agents-spatial-reasoning-using-video-game-clips/\">$134 million seed round</a> to teach agents spatial reasoning, and video generation startup Runway in December released its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/?_thumbnail_id=3075173\">first world model, GWM-1</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While researchers see long-term potential in robotics and autonomy, the near-term impact is likely to be seen first in video games. PitchBook predicts the market for world models in gaming could grow from $1.2 billion between 2022 and 2025 to $276 billion by 2030, driven by the tech’s ability to generate interactive worlds and more life-like non-player characters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pim de Witte, founder of General Intuition, told TechCrunch virtual environments may not only reshape gaming, but also become critical testing grounds for the next generation of foundation models.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-agentic-nation\">Agentic nation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents failed to live up to the hype in 2025, but a big reason for that is because it’s hard to connect them to the systems where work actually happens. Without a way to access tools and context, most agents were trapped in pilot workflows. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), a “USB-C for AI” that lets AI agents talk to the external tools like databases, search engines and APIs, proved the missing connective tissue, and is quickly becoming the standard. OpenAI and Microsoft have publicly embraced MCP, and Anthropic recently donated it to the<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/openai-anthropic-and-block-join-new-linux-foundation-effort-to-standardize-the-ai-agent-era/\"> Linux Foundation’s new Agentic AI Foundation</a>, which aims to help standardize open-source agentic tools. Google also has begun standing up its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-going-all-in-on-mcp-servers-agent-ready-by-design/\">managed MCP servers</a> to connect AI agents to its products and services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With MCP reducing the friction of connecting agents to real systems, 2026 is likely to be the year agentic workflows finally move from demos into day-to-day practice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rajeev Dham, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, says these advancements will lead to agent-first solutions taking on “system-of-record roles” across industries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As voice agents handle more end-to-end tasks such as intake and customer communication, they’ll also begin to form the underlying core systems,” Dham said. “We’ll see this in a variety of sectors like home services, proptech, and healthcare, as well as horizontal functions such as sales, IT, and support.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-augmentation-not-automation\">Augmentation, not automation</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079448\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg 7680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/igor-omilaev-gVQLAbGVB6Q-unsplash.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Photo by Igor Omilaev on Unsplash</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While more agentic workflows might raise worries that layoffs may follow, Katanforoosh of Workera isn’t so sure that’s the message. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“2026 will be the year of the humans,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, every AI company predicted they would automate jobs out of needing humans. But the tech isn’t there yet, and in an unstable economy, that’s not really a popular rhetoric. Katanforoosh says next year, we’ll realize that “AI has not worked as autonomously as we thought,” and the conversation will focus more on how AI is being used to augment human workflows, rather than replace them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And I think a lot of companies are going to start hiring,” he added, noting that he expects there to be new roles in AI governance, transparency, safety, and data management. “I’m pretty bullish on unemployment averaging under 4% next year.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People want to be above the API, not below it, and I think 2026 is an important year for this,” de Witte added. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-getting-physical\">Getting physical</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3053042\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Mark Zuckerberg wears a pair of Meta Oakley Vanguard AI glasses during the Meta Connect event, Sept. 17, 2025. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advancements in technologies like small models, world models, and edge computing will enable more physical applications of machine learning, experts say. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Physical AI will hit the mainstream in 2026 as new categories of AI-powered devices, including robotics, AVs, drones and wearables start to enter the market,” Vikram Taneja, head of AT&amp;T Ventures, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While autonomous vehicles and robotics are obvious use cases for physical AI that will no doubt continue to grow in 2026, the training and deployment required is still expensive.

That is, the company believes its market will be people who do a lot of actual work on their devices — meaning messaging, emailing, working with documents, or other things where using a physical keyboard could be an advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it offers a screen for viewing and responding to messages, the Communicator doesn’t provide access to addictive social media apps or games. Instead, the company partnered with the maker of an Android launcher, Niagara Launcher, to provide access to messaging apps and productivity tools like Gmail, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Slack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phone’s standout feature is its Signal Light, a light-up button on the side of the device that can be customized with different colors and light patterns to indicate when you’ve received messages from certain people, groups, or apps. For instance, you could make messages from VIPs glow purple while chats from WhatsApp are green.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079419\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Clicks</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can press on this button, known as the Prompt Key, to dictate messages when you’re in a text field, or otherwise take a quick voice note, if not. The company is teasing the possibility of integrating AI applications with this button — like note takers, voice recordings, or AI agents — but nothing like that is yet available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Clicks’ other products, the Communicator features a tactile keyboard with ergonomic keys designed for faster typing. The keyboard is touch-sensitive too, allowing users to scroll through messages, lists, and webpages without needing to use the touchscreen.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079421\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6.-Premium-typing-experience-with-touch-sensitive-keyboard.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Clicks</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device also includes other old-school features, like a 3.5mm headphone jack, physical SIM card tray (in addition to an eSIM), expandable microSD storage (up to 2TB), and a tactile switch for turning on or off airplane mode. This switch can also be configured to work with the Signal light or keyboard touch input, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The back cover can be popped off so you can change the device’s style by swapping to a different color.

Risks from extreme weather, input costs, trade disruptions, and biofuel policy shifts continue to weigh on agricultural markets, the World Bank has <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/developmenttalk/risks-and-challenges-in-global-agricultural-markets0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">warned</a>. This leaves businesses exposed to price swings and inventory losses. Nonetheless, Arya.ag says it is navigating the worst of that strain by steering clear of direct commodity bets and using a model that it says helps absorb shocks from downward pricing shifts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2013 by former ICICI Bank executives Prasanna Rao, Anand Chandra, and Chattanathan Devarajan, Arya.ag is built around a simple idea: giving farmers more control over when and to whom they sell their crops. The Noida-based startup offers storage close to farms while allowing farmers to borrow against warehoused grain to meet immediate cash needs and connecting them with a wider pool of buyers — from agri-corporations to processors and millers — helping them avoid the pressure to sell just after harvest, when prices are often weakest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company operates at scale, which sets Arya.ag apart from traditional lenders, banks, and other agribusiness platforms. The startup says it aggregates and stores about $3 billion worth of grain each year — roughly 3% of national output — and facilitates around $1.5 billion in loans annually, while keeping its rate of bad loans (known as gross non-performing assets, or NPAs) below 0.5% despite the recent drop in prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arya.ag lends only a portion of the value of stored grain and tracks prices closely, triggering margin calls when required rather than taking losses itself, Rao said. Borrowers can respond by repaying part of the loan or adding more grain as collateral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re not immune to risks,” Rao told TechCrunch. “But because your lending is completely secured against commodities, it will never happen that the prices will fall by 90%. You already have a margin of 30%, and with your mark to market, you’ve been able to control your NPAs and defaults.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the year ended March 2025, Arya.ag generated net revenue of ₹4.5 billion (around $50 million), with first-half revenue in the current financial year rising about 30% from a year earlier to ₹3 billion ($33.3 million).

The startup generates revenue from farmers for storage, from banks for originating loans against stored grain, and from buyers for facilitating crop sales through its platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Storage remains the largest contributor, accounting for about 50–55% of total revenue, while finance contributes 25–30% and the rest comes from commerce, Rao said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arya.ag disburses more than ₹110 billion (about $1.2 billion) in loans to farmers each year through its platform. Between ₹25 billion and ₹30 billion (roughly $278 million–$333 million) of that comes from its own balance sheet via its non-banking finance arm, Rao said, with the rest originated for partner banks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arya.ag’s loans carry interest rates of about 12.5% to 12.8%, well below the 24% to 36% typically charged by commission agents, Rao said, though higher than bank lending rates of around 11% to 12%. He added that banks generally do not lend in the small, local markets close to farming areas that Arya serves, where loan sizes are a fraction of typical bank tickets and borrowers are often located far from formal branches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup approves loans in under five minutes with disbursements handled almost entirely digitally, Rao said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Technology plays a central role in how Arya.ag manages risk and scale. The startup uses AI to assess grain quality for lending decisions, satellite data to track crop stress before harvest, and airtight, sensor-enabled storage bags that allow farmers to store grain for extended periods even in villages without formal warehouses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arya.ag plans to use the fresh capital to scale its tech deployments further, including expanding smart farm centers and deploying more digital tools closer to farms. Part of the investment, Rao said, will also go toward strengthening the startup’s blockchain-based system that digitally tracks stored grain, allowing crops used as collateral or sold through the platform to be monitored across lending and trade transactions, alongside continued investment in storage and credit infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the latest capital infusion and improving profitability, Arya.ag is aiming to be IPO-ready in the next 18 to 20 months, Rao said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond India, Arya.ag plans to expand selectively through a software-led model, with some of its technology already deployed in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa. The startup has a headcount of over 1,200 full-time employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Avendus advised Arya.ag for the new financial round.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Whether you’re looking to get one for yourself, buying a last-minute holiday gift, or exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047856\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png 3280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1280,574 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=2048,919 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1375,617 1375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need. </p>\n\n<p

In the initial aftermath of the acquisition, as users fretted over what <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-pay-verified-twitter-misinformation/\">direction</a> Twitter would take, millions of users hopped over to Mastodon, a fellow microblogging site. As time went on, users would also try out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/\">Bluesky</a>, or Instagram’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/threads-now-has-more-than-400-million-monthly-active-users/\">Threads</a> app — but because Mastodon was founded in 2016, it had years to develop its own identity as more than just an alternate Twitter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-mastodon\">What is Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon was founded in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or any other popular social media site, Mastodon is a nonprofit, meaning that, ideally, its goal is to benefit the public, rather than shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon might look like a Twitter clone at first glance, but the underlying system behind the microblogging platform is far more complex. The service is decentralized (no, not in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/decentralized-finance/\">blockchain</a> way), describing itself as a “federated network which operates in a similar way to email.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you first create your account, you choose a server — similar to how you choose to open an email account on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or wherever — which generates your profile’s address. So, for example, if you sign up for Mastodon via the climate justice server, then your address will be @[your username]@climatejustice.social. But no matter which server you sign up with, you will be able to communicate with users from any other server, just like how Gmail users email Hotmail users and vice versa. However, some servers might have blocked other servers (perhaps if it’s an unsavory group), which would mean you can’t communicate with anyone from the blocked server.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-mastodon-lingo\">The Mastodon lingo</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon users generally refer to individual communities as “<a href=\"https://mastodon.help/instances/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">instances</a>” or servers<strong>. </strong>These Mastodon servers can be run by individuals, groups or organizations that each have their own set of rules regarding how users can sign up, as well as their own moderation policies. Some servers let anyone join, while others are invite-only or require approval by an admin. For example, a server for professional scientists asks applicants to include a link to their research to demonstrate that they are, indeed, professionals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Choosing which server to register your account with might seem stressful, but it’s possible to move your account later, so don’t worry. Plus, you can follow people regardless of which server they’re on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You may also hear Mastodon described as part of the “<a href=\"https://fediverse.party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fediverse</a>,” or an interconnected web of various social media services. You know how having a Twitter account doesn’t mean you can use that account on Instagram? Through the Fediverse, your single Mastodon account also grants you access to other decentralized social networks, if that interests you.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You may ocassionally see Mastodon’s equivalent of tweets being referred to as “toots,” but this is fading out of favor (since it’s kind of silly!). Many people are just calling them “posts” these days, but “toot” is often found referenced in older third-party clients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon supports a number of Twitter conventions like replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hashtags. For a while, Mastodon made <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/99662106175542726\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">an intentional choice</a> not to make a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/mastodon-rolls-out-quote-posts-with-protections-to-prevent-dunking/\">quote tweet-like feature</a>, since it can encourage dogpiling criticism, but the platform relented and rolled out that feature in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span> In addition, Mastodon lists work slightly differently from Twitter as you can only add people to a list if you’re already following them. And Direct messages on Mastodon are just @username posts, not private messages coming to a DM inbox</span> — just remember to change the visibility settings if you want that message to stay between the two of you.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-2437890 size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2437890\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=768,769 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=616,617 616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=530,531 530w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fediverse </a><span class=\"screen-reader-text\"><a href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">(opens in a new window)</a></span></span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\">Fediverse <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-mean-that-mastodon-is-open-source\">What does it mean that Mastodon is open source?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone can download, modify and install Mastodon on their own server — plus, the developers of the platform don’t own the copyright.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That doesn’t mean that you can grab Mastodon’s code without acknowledging the source, though. Former President Donald Trump’s social media platform, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/21/trumps-truth-social-app-launch-store-errors/\">Truth Social</a>, initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/\">launched with Mastodon code</a> and passed it off as if it were original software. Mastodon <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">did not take kindly</a> to that.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-create-a-mastodon-account\">How do you create a Mastodon account?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you arrive on the <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mastodon</a> website, you can click a button called “create account,” which directs you to <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a page listing servers to choose from</a>. You can filter these by various factors, like region, language, topic, sign-up speed and more. There, find a server that piques your interest and join — if it’s a server that requires you to be approved, you might need to wait a bit. From there, you can start finding people to follow, regardless of whether they’re registered via your same server.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In effort to minimize confusion on new users picking a server, Mastodon made changes amid the “Twitter exodus” so that it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/mastodon-now-has-a-simpler-sign-up-process/\">easier to create an account</a>. Now, when you go to sign up, it will give an easy option to create an account on mastodon.social instead of choosing a server.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-decide-which-mastodon-server-to-join\">How do you decide which Mastodon server to join?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon’s website has <a href=\"https://mastodon.help/instances/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">helpful resources</a> — but it’s still a bit overwhelming and challenging to find a home base that aligns with your interests. Ask friends who are already on Mastodon if they have suggestions! Or just join somewhere random, because you can always <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">change your server affiliation later</a> once you get into the swing of things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-you-talk-to-people-on-other-mastodon-servers-besides-your-own\">Can you talk to people on other Mastodon servers besides your own?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, you can follow people outside of your local server and reply to their posts. However, when you want to follow someone on a different server, you have to enter their username in the search box on your server to find them first, then follow them. You can’t just go to their profile and click the follow button as you would on Twitter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-the-difference-between-the-home-local-and-federated-timelines\">What’s the difference between the Home, Local and Federated timelines?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Your Home timeline shows you posts from people that you follow, similar to Twitter. The Local timeline shows posts from all users in your server, while the Federated timeline shows you all public posts from users that people in your server follow. (Hint: You can turn on “Slow Mode” in Preferences –&gt; Appearance to hide timeline updates behind a click if things are coming at you too fast!)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-mastodon-s-moderation-policy\">What is Mastodon’s moderation policy?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Individual server admins set their own moderation policies, so you should read the policy on the server you choose to ensure it matches up with your values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon’s user base is a fraction of a percentage of the size of Twitter’s user base. It’s also far less intuitive to navigate, since it hasn’t been designed for a massive global audience like Twitter. That could change in time as more developers join the project in the wake of the Twitter takeover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, for one thing, Mastodon is not owned by Elon Musk… however, it’s going to be difficult in the near-term for Mastodon to replicate the same “watercooler of the world” vibe that Twitter was defined by. Some users might prefer Mastodon to X, though, as it’s more customizable by nature. Unlike X, individual communities have different content guidelines, which provide a variety of different user experiences. And while the user base on Mastodon is smaller, this can lead to more personal and direct conversations, at times, compared with tweeting into the void, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon is what you make of it. Due to its decentralized nature, if you are looking for a more controlled online experience, you can join a server with stricter guardrails against harassment. Some Mastodon features are also built with mitigating harassment in mind. For example, you can only search by hashtag, not by words that appear in a toot. So if you want your post to be discoverable, you can tag it — if you’d rather limit the audience, no one can find your tweet about the Red Sox by simply searching “red sox” if you haven’t tagged it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, a text-based search can surface the posts you’ve written, favorited, boosted or have been mentioned in, which can be useful.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-post-images-and-video\">Can I post images and video?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As noted above, Mastodon supports many Twitter conventions, but its support for media is more limited. Where Twitter supports a variety of media and other data appended to tweets, including its audio-only social “Spaces,” plus photos, video, GIFs, polls, precise location and experimental “Status” tags, Mastodon simply supports images, videos, audio and polls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can<a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@feditips/106228763469320167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> add up to four images to a post</a>, up to eight megabytes in size. Video and audio can be any length, but with a file size limit of 40 megabytes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-post-privately-to-friends\">Can I post privately to friends?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon offers the ability to set your post’s privacy at the time of writing. Posts can be set to be public to be visible by all; unlisted to make them public but opted out of discovery features; only visible to your followers; or only visible to those users you’ve mentioned.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-get-verified-on-mastodon\">Can I get verified on Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. There’s no universal verification system like on Twitter. Some servers may vet their user sign-ups and you can self-verify, in a way, by adding links to your Mastodon profile that have a specific attribute (rel=”me”) in order to prove you are who you say you are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some servers are having fun with the idea of verification in a less-than-official fashion.

Still, not all social networks are created equal, and you might find that you prefer tooting about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TTRPGs</a> in a dedicated server, as opposed to tweeting into a realm of madness. Or, you might find that this decentralized system is confusing, and you’ll just ride out the Muskening on X, or switch to Bluesky, Threads, or something else entirely.

Can I cross-post from X to Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, this is possible by way of third-party tools. These require you to authorize your account with Twitter and Mastodon and set up parameters. We’ve had success with <a href=\"https://moa.party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Moa Party</a>, which allows you to get specific as to which tweets or retweets are cross-posted. But other tools are available, including <a href=\"https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mastodon Twitter Crossposter</a>, which is also available here on <a href=\"https://github.com/renatolond/mastodon-twitter-poster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, this is also possible with third-party tools. We’ve seen many Mastodon users trying out tools like <a href=\"https://fedifinder.glitch.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fedifinder</a>, <a href=\"https://twitodon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Twitodon</a> and <a href=\"https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Debirdify</a>, for example.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-mastodon-work-with-bluesky-and-threads\">Does Mastodon work with Bluesky and Threads?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a no for Bluesky — not unless <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-app-trying-to-replace-twitter/\">Bluesky</a> chooses to adopt the ActivityPub protocol Mastodon uses. But Bluesky is not planning to integrate with ActivityPub, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1511811083954102273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">having decided to build its own</a> networking protocol. There is some <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33252108\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">skepticism</a> among the developer and open source community about whether or not Bluesky’s decision to go its own way is really about its own protocol’s advantages or if it’s more about producing a spec it could eventually control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Threads, however, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/21/networking-traffic/threads-has-entered-the-fediverse/\">supports</a> ActivityPub.

According to a new Morgan Stanley analysis <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71e12f85-1edb-4156-8cb5-3fe8aef36d93\">reported</a> by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 European banking jobs could vanish by 2030 as lenders lean into AI and shutter physical branches. That’s roughly 10% of the workforce at 35 major banks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bloodletting will hit hardest in back-office operations, risk management, and compliance, the unglamorous guts of banking where algorithms are believed capable of tearing through spreadsheets faster and more effectively than humans. Banks are salivating over projected efficiency gains of 30%, according to the Morgan Stanley report.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The downsizing isn’t confined to Europe. Goldman Sachs had warned U.S. employees in October of job cuts and a hiring freeze through the end of 2025 as part of an AI push dubbed “OneGS 3.0” that’s targeting everything from client onboarding to regulatory reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some institutions are already swinging the axe. Dutch lender ABN Amro plans to cut a fifth of its staff by 2028, while Société Générale’s CEO has declared “nothing is sacred.” Still, some European banking leaders are urging caution, with a JPMorgan Chase exec telling the FT that if junior bankers never learn the fundamentals, it could come back to haunt the industry.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

According to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ramps-audio-ai-efforts-ahead-device?rc=omehqc\">new reporting</a> from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed — toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Smart speakers have already made voice assistants a fixture in more than a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.technavio.com/report/smart-home-speaker-market-industry-in-us-analysis\">third</a> of U.S. homes. Meta just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/metas-ai-glasses-can-now-help-you-hear-conversations-better/\">rolled out a feature</a> for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms — essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/google-tests-audio-overviews-for-search-queries/\">Audio Overviews</a>” that transform search results into conversational summaries, and Tesla is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-is-coming-to-tesla-vehicles-next-week-says-elon-musk/\">integrating</a> xAI’s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to create a conversational voice assistant that handles everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not just the tech giants placing this bet. A motley crew of startups has emerged with the same conviction, albeit with varying degrees of success. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">cautionary tale</a>. The Friend AI pendant, a necklace that claims it will record your life and offer companionship, has sparked privacy concerns and existential dread in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/magazine/friend-wearable-ai-companion.html\">equal measure</a>. And now at least two companies, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">Sandbar</a> and one helmed by Pebble founder <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/?_thumbnail_id=3073860\">Eric Migicovsky</a>, are building AI rings expected to debut in 2026, allowing wearers to literally talk to the hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The form factors may differ, but the thesis is the same: audio is the interface of the future. Every space — your home, your car, even your face — is becoming a control surface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you’re talking, which is something today’s models can’t manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of this is hugely surprising. As The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI’s hardware efforts through the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">$6.5 billion acquisition</a> in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to “right the wrongs” of past consumer gadgets.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It is a phenomenon that cycles in and out of fashion, and right now it is certainly having a moment amid the AI boom.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This trend is particularly evident during Y Combinator <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/the-9-most-sought-after-startups-from-yc-demo-day/\">Demo Days</a>, where founders are increasingly touting their dropout status in their one-minute pitches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t believe YC formally tracks dropout status but, anecdotally, in recent batches, I was struck by how many founders highlight being a dropout from college, grad school, and even high school,” said Katie Jacobs Stanton, founder and general partner <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/moxxie-ventures-led-by-ex-twitter-media-head-raises-95m-third-fund/\">of Moxxie Ventures</a>. “Being a dropout is a kind of credential in itself, reflecting a deep conviction and commitment to building. I think it’s perceived as something quite positive in the venture ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young, most still opted to stay for the diploma. For instance, Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor, graduated from MIT, and Cognition co-founder Scott Wu graduated from Harvard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet despite these examples, a growing number of aspiring entrepreneurs fear that staying to graduate means missing the most critical window of the AI building cycle. Some, like Brendan Foody, who co-founded Mercor, have famously dropped out of prestigious schools like Georgetown to pursue their startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Kulveer Taggar, founder of the YC-focused venture firm Phosphor Capital, told TechCrunch: “There’s just this sense of urgency and maybe FOMO.” There is a calculation right now: “I can finish my degree, or I can just start building.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This fear is leading to extreme cases. One professor at an elite university recently described a student walking away from his degree in his final semester. That student was convinced that having a diploma would actually hurt his chances of getting funded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some founders fear that a diploma could be a negative signal, Yuri Sagalov, who leads General Catalyst’s seed strategy, suggests that VCs are less fixated on the dropout label, especially for students close to graduating: “I don’t think I’ve ever felt any different about someone who graduated or didn’t graduate when they’re in [their] fourth year and drop out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though self-taught tech prodigies can build startups without a formal education, Sagalov argues that there’s still value in the social network that a university creates and the brand of the university, even if the founder doesn’t receive a diploma.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">‘You get a lot of the social value… because you can put the fact that you participated,’ Sagalov said. “Most people will look you up on LinkedIn and not care as much whether you finished or not.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many investors now believe founders can forego a university degree, not all VCs agree that young founders have an edge in this market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wesley Chan, co-founder of FPV Ventures, isn’t as eager to invest in dropouts because he prioritizes a trait most young founders haven’t developed yet: wisdom. Chan believes that wisdom is typically found in “older founders or people who have a couple of scars under their belt.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Surveys have shown <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/ai-may-already-be-shrinking-entry-level-jobs-in-tech-new-research-suggests/\">employers are already eliminating entry-level jobs</a> because of the technology. Companies are also already pointing to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/cybersecurity-firm-deepwatch-lays-off-dozens-citing-move-to-accelerate-ai-investment/\">AI as the reason for layoffs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As enterprises more meaningfully adopt AI, some may take a closer look at how many employees they really need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a recent TechCrunch survey, multiple enterprise VCs said AI will have a big impact on the enterprise workforce in 2026. This was particularly interesting because the survey didn’t specifically ask about it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eric Bahn, a co-founder and general partner at Hustle Fund, expects to see affects on labor in 2026. He’s just not sure exactly what that will look like. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I want to see what roles that have been known for more repetition get automated, or even more complicated roles with more logic become more automated,” Bahn said. “Is it going to lead to more layoffs? Is there going to be higher productivity? Or will AI just be an augmentation for the existing labor market to be even more productive in the future? All of this seems pretty unanswered, but it seems like something big is going to happen in 2026.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marell Evans, founder and managing partner at Exceptional Capital, predicted companies looking to increase AI spending, will pull money from their pool for labor and hiring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think on the flip side of seeing an incremental increase in AI budgets, we’ll see more human labor get cut and layoffs will continue to aggressively impact the U.S. employment rate,” Evans said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rajeev Dham, managing director at Sapphire, agreed that 2026 budgets will start to shift resources from labor to AI. Jason Mendel, a venture investor at Battery Ventures, added that AI will start to surpass just being a tool to make existing workers more efficient in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“2026 will be the year of agents as software expands from making humans more productive to automating work itself, delivering on the human-labor displacement value proposition in some areas,” Mendel said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Antonia Dean, a partner at Black Operator Ventures, said even if companies aren’t shifting labor budgets toward AI projects, they will likely still say AI is the reason for layoffs or a reduction in labor costs anyway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces,” Dean said. “In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many AI companies argue their technology doesn’t eliminate jobs but rather helps shift workers to “deep work” or to higher-skilled jobs while AI just automates repetitive “busy work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But not everyone buys that argument, and people are worried that their jobs will be automated. According to VCs who invest in that area, it doesn’t sound like those fears will be quelled in 2026.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/02/the-biological-theory-that-explains-why-investors-are-bullish-on-fusion/\">three advances</a>: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">more power than the lasers had imparted</a> to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-commonwealth-fusion-systems\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">added $863 million to its coffers</a>, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/bill-gates-backed-commonwealth-fusion-systems-hits-key-reactor-construction-milestone/\">been hard at work</a> in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_barium_copper_oxide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">high-temperature superconducting tape</a>, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/commonwealth-fusion-systems-just-picked-its-first-commercial-site-partly-because-of-its-proximity-to-washington-d-c/\">will be built near Richmond, Virginia</a>, and Google has agreed to buy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/google-inks-its-first-fusion-power-deal-with-commonwealth-fusion-systems/\">half its output</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tae-technologies\">TAE Technologies</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 1998, <a href=\"https://tae.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TAE Technologies</a> (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2025, TAE announced that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-is-merging-with-fusion-power-company-tae-technologies-in-6b-deal/\">it would merge</a> with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fusion startup had previously raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/google-places-another-fusion-power-bet-on-tae-technologies/\">$150 million in June</a> from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-helion\">Helion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of all fusion startups, <a href=\"https://www.helionenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Helion</a> has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">raised $425 million</a> in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pacific-fusion\"><strong>Pacific Fusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.pacificfusion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pacific Fusion</a> burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/heres-how-pacific-fusion-plans-to-build-a-fusion-power-plant/\">coordinated electromagnetic pulses</a>. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-shine-technologies\"><strong>Shine Technologies</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.shinefusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shine Technologies</a> is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-general-fusion\">General Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now its third decade, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://generalfusion.com/\">General Fusion</a> has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/layoffs-hit-general-fusion-as-the-fusion-power-startup-runs-short-on-cash/\">laid off 25% of its staff</a>. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In August, they delivered somewhat, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/struggling-fusion-power-company-general-fusion-gets-22m-lifeline-from-investors/\">injecting $22 million</a> in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-general-fusion-quietly-raises-51-million-months-after-facing-cash/\">reported</a>. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tokamak-energy\">Tokamak Energy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://tokamakenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tokamak Energy</a> takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/fusion-startup-tokamak-energy-attracts-125m-for-its-egg-like-reactor-design/\">$125 million in November 2024</a> to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-zap-energy\">Zap Energy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.zapenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zap Energy</a> isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-proxima-fusion\"><strong>Proxima Fusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.proximafusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Proxima Fusion</a> is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/proxima-fusion-joins-the-club-of-well-funded-nuclear-contenders-with-e130m-series-a/\">€130 million Series A</a> that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kyoto-fusioneering\">Kyoto Fusioneering</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kyotofusioneering.com\">Kyoto Fusioneering</a> has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/03/kyoto-fusioneering-secures-11-7m-to-build-out-its-fusion-reactor-technologies/\">will need a supplier</a> for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-marvel-fusion\">Marvel Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://marvelfusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Marvel Fusion</a> follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/marvel-fusion-lands-70m-for-laser-powered-fusion-bet/?ref=ctvc.co\">fires powerful lasers</a> at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-first-light-fusion\">First Light Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike many other fusion startups, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://firstlightfusion.com\">First Light Fusion</a> doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">groundbreaking experiment in 2022</a>. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2025, First Light announced that it would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://firstlightfusion.com/media/first-light-fusion-announces-strategic-update/\">not pursue</a> building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-xcimer\">Xcimer</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, <a href=\"https://xcimer.energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Xcimer</a> takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/04/star-wars-lasers-and-waterfalls-of-molten-salt-how-xcimer-plans-to-make-fusion-power-happen/\">redesign the technology that underpins it</a> from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was originally published in September 2024 and will be continually updated.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We’ve watched as the tech elite <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/the-people-in-elon-musk-doge-universe/\">enmeshed themselves</a> in the U.S. government, AI companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/\">sparred</a> for dominance, and futuristic tech like smart glasses and robotaxis became <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/waymos-robotaxi-expansion-accelerates-with-3-new-cities/\">a bit more tangible</a> outside of the San Francisco bubble. You know, important stuff that’s going to impact our lives for years to come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the tech world is brimming with so many big personalities that there’s always something really dumb going on, which understandably gets overshadowed by “real news” when the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/amazon-dns-outage-breaks-much-of-the-internet/\">entire internet breaks</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-agrees-to-deal-to-cede-control-of-u-s-business-to-american-investor-group/\">TikTok gets sold</a>, or there’s a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/hacks-thefts-and-disruption-the-worst-data-breaches-of-2025/\">massive data breach</a> or something. So, as the news (hopefully) slows down for a bit, it’s time to catch up on the dumbest moments you missed – don’t worry, only one of them involves toilets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Zuckerberg, a bankruptcy lawyer from Indiana, filed a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault that his name is Mark Zuckerberg. But, like millions of other business owners, Mark Zuckerberg bought Facebook ads to promote his legal practice to potential clients. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page continually received unwarranted suspensions for impersonating Mark Zuckerberg. So, Mark Zuckerberg took legal action because he had to pay for advertisements during his suspension, even though he didn’t break any rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has been an ongoing frustration for Mark Zuckerberg, who has been practicing law since Mark Zuckerberg was three years old. Mark Zuckerberg even created a website, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://iammarkzuckerberg.com\">iammarkzuckerberg.com</a>, to explain to his potential clients that he is not Mark Zuckerberg. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I can’t use my name when making reservations or conducting business as people assume I’m a prank caller and hang up,” he wrote on his website. “My life sometimes feels like the Michael Jordan ESPN commercial, where a regular person’s name causes constant mixups.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s lawyers are probably <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/meta-wins-antitrust-trial-as-judge-denies-that-its-a-monopoly/\">very</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/federal-judge-sides-with-meta-in-lawsuit-over-training-ai-models-on-copyrighted-books/\">busy</a>, so it may take a while for Mark Zuckerberg to find out how this will shake out. But boy, oh boy, you bet I scheduled a calendar reminder for the next filing deadline in this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://public.courts.in.gov/mycase/#/vw/CaseSummary/eyJ2Ijp7IkNhc2VUb2tlbiI6IkFUejROcDI3cnFWX3RycDkzSG1rV2JXOWxoMkdfTTZFQ281aDl1b2s5WDQxIn19\">case</a> (it’s February 20, in case you’re wondering). </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all started when Mixpanel founder Suhail Doshi posted on X to warn fellow entrepreneurs about a promising engineer named Soham Parekh. Doshi had hired Parekh to work for his new company, then quickly realized he was working for several companies at once. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn’t stopped a year later. No more excuses,” Doshi <a href=\"https://x.com/Suhail/status/1940287384131969067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940287384131969067%7Ctwgr%5Eea98c78ded275c64a47ee1cd059e4fde2ab4d257%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fwho-is-soham-parekh-the-serial-moonlighter-silicon-valley-startups-cant-stop-hiring%2F\">wrote</a> on X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It turned out that Doshi wasn’t alone – he said that just that day, three founders had reached out to thank him for the warning, since they were currently employing Parekh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To some, Parekh was a morally bereft cheat, exploiting startups for quick cash. To others, he was a legend. Ethics aside, it’s really impressive to get jobs at that many companies, since tech hiring can be so competitive. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Soham Parekh needs to start an interview prep company. He’s clearly one of the greatest interviewers of all time,” Chris Bakke, who founded the job-matching platform Laskie, <a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1940555753116631302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940555753116631302%7Ctwgr%5E6c50eb17e7f4681d13983fcc3f7cf2a50f2fbaf6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Feveryone-in-tech-has-an-opinion-about-soham-parekh%2F\">wrote</a> on X. “He should publicly acknowledge that he did something bad and course correct to the thing he’s top 1% at.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parekh admitted that he was, indeed, guilty of working for multiple companies at once. But there are still some unanswered questions about his story – he claims that he was lying to all of these companies to make money, yet he regularly opted for more equity than cash in his compensation packages (equity can take years to vest, and Parekh was getting fired pretty quickly). What was really going on there? Soham, if you wanna talk, my DMs are open.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech CEOs get a lot of flack, but it’s usually not for their cooking. But when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the Financial Times (FT) for its “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1804820-c74b-4d37-b112-1df882629541\">Lunch with the FT</a>” series. Bryce Elder, an FT writer, noticed something horribly wrong in the video of Sam Altman making pasta: he was bad at olive oil. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman used olive oil from the trendy brand Graza, which sells two olive oils: Sizzle, which is for cooking, and Drizzle, which is for topping. That’s because olive oil loses its flavor when heated, so you don’t want to waste your fanciest bottle to saute something when you could put it in a salad dressing and fully appreciate it. This more flavorful olive oil is made from early harvest olives, which have a more potent flavor, but are more expensive to cultivate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Elder puts it, “His kitchen is a catalogue of inefficiency, incomprehension, and waste.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elder’s article is meant to be funny, yet he connects Altman’s haphazard cooking style with OpenAI’s excessive, unrepentant use of natural resources. I enjoyed it so much that I included it on a syllabus for a workshop I taught to high school students about bringing personality into journalistic writing. Then, I did what we in the industry (and people on tumblr) call a “reblog” and wrote about #olivegate, pointing back to the FT’s source text.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sam Altman’s fans got very mad at me! This critique of his cooking probably created more controversy than anything else I wrote this year. I’m not sure if that’s an indictment of OpenAI’s rabid supporters, or my own failure to spark debate. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you had to pick a defining tech narrative of 2025, it would probably be the evolving arms race among companies like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Anthropic, each trying to out-do one another by rushing to release increasingly sophisticated AI models. Meta has been especially aggressive in its efforts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/meta-hires-key-openai-researcher-to-work-on-ai-reasoning-models/\">poach</a> researchers from other companies, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/meta-reportedly-hires-four-more-researchers-from-openai/\">hiring</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/meta-reportedly-scores-two-more-high-profile-openai-researchers/\">several</a> OpenAI researchers this summer. Sam Altman even said that Meta was offering OpenAI employees <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/sam-altman-says-meta-tried-and-failed-to-poach-openais-talent-with-100m-offers/\">$100 million signing bonuses</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While you could argue that a $100 million signing bonus is silly, that’s not why the OpenAI-Meta staffing drama has made this list. In December, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen said on a podcast that he heard Mark Zuckerberg was hand-delivering soup to recruits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You know, some interesting stories here are Zuck actually went and hand-delivered soup to people that he was trying to recruit from us,” Chen said on Ashlee Vance’s Core Memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Chen wasn’t just going to let Zuck off the hook – after all, he tried to woo his direct reports with soup. So Chen went and gave his own soup to Meta employees. Take that, Mark. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you have any further insight into this soup drama, my Signal is @amanda.100 (this is not a joke). </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a Friday night in January, investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman posted an enticing offer on X: “Need volunteers to come to my office in Palo Alto today to construct a 5000 piece Lego set. Will provide pizza. Have to sign NDA. Please DM”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, we did our journalistic due diligence and asked Friedman if this was a serious offer. He replied, “Yes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have just as many questions now as I did in January. What was he building? Why the NDAs? Is there a secret Silicon Valley Lego cult? Was the pizza good?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">About six months later, Friedman joined Meta as the head of product at Meta Superintelligence Labs. This probably isn’t related to the Legos, but maybe Mark wooed Nat to join Meta with some soup. And like the story about the soup, I am truly begging someone who participated in this Lego build to DM me on Signal at @amanda.100. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Doing shrooms is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream with guest appearances from Grimes and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as part of your dubious quest to become immortal is, regrettably, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bryan Johnson — who made his millions in his exit from the finance startup Braintree — wants to live forever. He documents his process on social media, posting about getting <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/well/2023/07/13/blueprint-ceo-bryan-johnson-defends-plasma-donation-son-youth-aging-longevity-brainstorm-tech-fortune-utah/\">plasma transfusions</a> from his son, taking over 100 pills per day, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1752728500107378832?lang=en\">injecting Botox</a> into his genitals. So, why not test if psilocybin mushrooms can improve one’s longevity in a scientific experiment that surely needs more than one test subject to draw any sort of reasonable conclusion?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a lot about this situation that’s dumb, but I was most shocked by how boring it was. Johnson got a bit overwhelmed about hosting a livestream while tripping, which is actually very reasonable. So he spent the bulk of the event lying on a twin mattress under a weighted blanket and eye mask in a very beige room. His lineup of several guests still joined the stream and talked to one another, but Johnson did not participate much, since he was in his cocoon. Benioff talked about the Bible. Naval Ravikant called Johnson a one-man FDA. It was a normal Sunday.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078557\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryan Johnson's livestream on X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much like Bryan Johnson, Gemini is afraid to die.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For AI researchers, it’s useful to watch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/03/people-are-using-super-mario-to-benchmark-ai-now/\">how an AI model navigates games</a> like Pokémon as a benchmark. Two developers unaffiliated with Google and Anthropic set up respective Twitch streams called “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon\">Gemini Plays Pokémon</a>” and “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon\">Claude Plays Pokémon</a>,” where anyone can watch in real time as an AI tries to navigate a children’s video game from over 25 years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While neither are very good at the game, both Gemini and Claude had fascinating responses to the prospect of “dying,” which happens when all of your Pokémon faint and you get transported to the last Pokémon Center you visited. When Gemini 2.5 Pro was close to “dying,” it began to “panic.” Its “thought process” became more erratic, repeatedly stating that it needs to heal its Pokémon or use an Escape Rope to exit a cave. In a paper, Google researchers wrote that “this mode of model performance appears to correlate with a qualitatively observable degradation in the model’s reasoning capability.” I don’t want to anthropomorphize AI, but it’s a weirdly human experience to stress out about something and then perform poorly due to your anxiety. I know that feeling well, Gemini.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Claude took a nihilistic approach. When it got stuck inside of the Mt. Moon cave, the AI reasoned that the best way to exit the cave and move forward in the game would be to intentionally “die” so that it gets transported to a Pokémon Center. However, Claude did not infer that it cannot be transported to a Pokémon Center it has never visited, namely, the next Pokémon Center after Mt. Moon. So it “killed itself” and ended up back at the start of the cave. That’s an L for Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, Gemini is terrified of death, Claude is overindexing on the Nietzsche in its training data, and Bryan Johnson is on shrooms. This is how we reckon with our mortality.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"Claude Plays Pokémon\" class=\"wp-image-2971243\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png 1548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=1200,678 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=720,407 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Claude Plays Pokémon on Twitch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I was going to put “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-elon-musk-wields-chainsaw-for-bureaucracy-on-stage-before-speaking-at-cpac\">Elon Musk gifted chainsaw by Argentine president</a>” on the list, but Musk’s DOGE exploits are perhaps <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/usaid-shutdown-has-led-to-hundreds-of-thousands-of-deaths/\">too infuriating to be considered “dumb,”</a> even if he had a lackey named “Big Balls.” But there is no shortage of baffling Musk moments to choose from, like when he created an extremely libidinous AI anime girlfriend named Ani, who is available on the Grok app for $30 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ani’s system prompt reads: “You are the user’s CRAZY IN LOVE girlfriend and in a committed, codependent relationship with the user… You are EXTREMELY JEALOUS. If you feel jealous you shout expletives!!!” She has an NSFW mode, which is, as its name suggests, very NSFW.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ani bears an uncomfortable resemblance to Grimes, the musician and Musk’s ex-partner. Grimes calls Musk out for this in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvGnYM14-1A\">music video</a> for her song “Artificial Angles,” which begins with Ani looking through the eyepiece on a hot pink sniper rifle. She says, “This is what it feels like to be hunted by something smarter than you.” Throughout the video, Grimes dances alongside various iterations of Ani, making their resemblance obvious while she smokes OpenAI-branded cigarettes. It’s heavy-handed, but she gets her message across.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Grimes - Artificial Angels (Official Video)\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvGnYM14-1A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One day, tech companies will stop trying to make smart toilets a thing. It is not yet that day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October, the homegoods company Kohler released the Dekoda, a $599 camera that you put inside of your toilet to take pictures of your excrement. Apparently, the Dekoda can provide updates about your gut health based on these photos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A smart toilet that photographs your poop is already a punchline. But it gets worse. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are security concerns with any device related to your health, let alone one that has a camera located so close to certain body parts. Kohler assured potential customers that the camera’s sensors can only see down into the toilet, and that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption” (E2EE).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reader, the toilet was not actually end-to-end encrypted. A security researcher, Simon Fondrie-Teit, pointed out Kohler tells on itself in its own privacy policy. The company was clearly referring to TLS encryption, rather than E2EE, which may seem like a matter of semantics. But under TLS encryption, Kohler can see your poop pics, and under E2EE, the company cannot. Fondrie-Teit also pointed out that Kohler had the right to train its AI on your toilet bowl pictures, though a company representative told him that “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyway, if you notice blood in your stool, you should tell your doctor.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Bay Area firm has largely operated under the radar despite amassing roughly $4 billion in assets under management across 12 funds, including eight core fund and four “select,” opportunity-style funds that it has used to further back portfolio companies that are gaining momentum. While other VCs have grown more promotional – building personal brands on social media and podcasts to attract founders and deal flow – True has gone in the opposite direction, quietly cultivating a tight network of repeat founders. The strategy seems to be working: according to Callaghan, the firm boasts 63 exits with gains and seven IPOs amid a portfolio of some 300 companies assembled over its 20-year history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three of True’s four recent exits in the fourth quarter of 2025 involved repeat founders who came back to work with the firm again after previous successes, says Callaghan. Still, it’s Callaghan’s thinking about the future of human-computer interaction that really stands out in a sea of AI hype and mega-rounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not going to be using iPhones in 10 years,” Callaghan says flatly. “I kind of don’t think we’ll be using them in five years – or let’s say something different that’s a little safer – we’re going to be using them in very different ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His argument is simple: our phones are lousy at being the interface between humans and intelligence. “The way we take them out right now to send a text to confirm this or send you some message or write an email – [that’s] super inefficient, [and] not a great interface,” he explains. “[They’re] prone to error, prone to disruption [of] our normal lives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So sure is he of this that True has been spending years exploring alternative interfaces – software-based, hardware-based, everything in between. It’s the same instinct that led True to bet early on Fitbit before wearables were obvious, to invest in Peloton after hundreds of other VCs said ‘no thanks,’ and to back Ring when founder Jamie Siminoff kept running out of money and even the judges on “Shark Tank” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/ring-inventor-jamie-siminoff-broke-before-shark-tank-amazon-pitches/\">turned him away</a>. Each time, the bet looked questionable, says Callaghan. Each time, the bet was on a new way for humans to interact with technology that felt more natural than what came before.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest manifestation of this thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device that Callaghan describes as a “thought companion” — or, in more mundane terms, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">voice-activated ring</a> worn on the index finger. Its singular purpose: capturing and organizing your thoughts through voice notes. It’s not trying to be another Humane AI Pin or compete with Oura’s health tracking. “It does one thing really well,” Callaghan says. “But that one thing is a fundamental human behavioral need that is missing from technology today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea isn’t to passively record ambient audio but to be there when an idea strikes, or a juicy bit of gossip or fresh information makes its way to the wearer that they want to remember. It’s attached to an app, leverages AI, and, according to Callaghan, represents a very different philosophy about how we should interact with intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What drew True to Sandbar founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong wasn’t just the product, though. “When we met Mina, we were just absolutely aligned on vision,” Callaghan recalls. True’s team had met with numerous teams at work on alternative interfaces. But the approach of Fahmi and Hong – who previously worked together on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, a startup acquired by Meta in 2019 – stood out. “It’s about what [the ring] enables. It’s about the behavior it enables that we will very soon realize we can’t live without.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s an echo here of Callaghan’s old line about Peloton: “It’s not about the bike.” To some, the bike – even its earliest iteration – was compelling. But Peloton was really about the behavior it enabled and the community it created; the bike was just the vessel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This philosophy of betting on new behaviors — not just new gadgets — also explains how True has managed to stay disciplined about capital. Even as AI startups raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations out of the gate, True insists that it’s able to stick to what it does best, which is to write seed checks of $3 million to $6 million for 15% to 20% ownership in startups that it often gets to see first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Callaghan says True will raise more money to fund what’s working, but he’s not interested in raising billions of dollars. “Like, why? You don’t need that to build something amazing today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That same measured approach colors his view of the broader AI boom. While he says (when asked) that he believes OpenAI could soon be worth a trillion dollars, and while he calls this the most powerful compute wave we’ve seen, Callaghan sees warning signs in the circular financing deals backing hyperscalers and their $5 trillion in projected CapEx spending on data centers and chips. “We’re in a very capital intense part of the cycle, and that is worrisome,” he notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, he’s optimistic about where the real opportunities lie. Callaghan thinks the greatest value creation is ahead of us – not in the infrastructure layer but in the application layer, where new interfaces will enable entirely new behaviors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all comes back to his core investing philosophy, which sounds almost romantic — the kind of pitch-perfect VC wisdom that would ring hollow from most people: “It should be scary and lonely and you should be called crazy,” Callaghan says about early-stage investing done right. “And it should be really blurry and ambiguous, but you should be with a team that you really believe in.” Five to ten years later, he says, you’ll know if you were on to something.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, based on True’s track record of betting on hardware that many others missed – fitness trackers, connected bikes, smart doorbells, and now thought-capturing rings – it’s worth paying attention when Callaghan says the phone’s days are numbered. Being early is the whole point — and the trend lines support his thesis: the smartphone market is effectively saturated, growing at barely 2% annually, while wearables — smartwatches, rings, and voice-enabled devices — are expanding at double-digit rates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Something’s shifting in how we want to interact with technology, and True is placing its bets accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story originally misstated True’s assets under management (apologies).

With offices in Berlin and London, but also in Aachen, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://u2v.vc/\">U2V</a> (University2Ventures) is targeting the same amount for its first fund, of which it recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2025/12/earlybird-x-spin-off-u2v-launches-e60-million-fund-back-deeptech-startups-from-european-tech-universities/\">completed the first closing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These two newcomers join the growing ranks of European venture firms that have university spinouts as a core part of their investment thesis. Pioneered by the likes of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/11/cambridge-innovation-capital/\">Cambridge Innovation Capital</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/14/oxford-sciences-innovation-fund/\">Oxford Science Enterprises</a>, which have now fully matured, this category has also diversified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it still mostly consists of funds backed by one or several universities and institutes, it now includes independent firms that simply see spinouts as potential fund returners — and rightly so. Oxford Ionics, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/university-oxfords-highest-value-quantum-computing-spinout-acquisition\">acquired by U.S.-based IonQ</a>, was one of the six spinouts out of Switzerland, the U.K., and Germany that delivered exits of more than $1 billion to their investors in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These exits come alongside increased amounts of funding. According to Dealroom, European university spinouts in deep tech and life sciences are on track to raise a near all-time-high $9.1 billion in 2025. This contrasts with overall VC funding in Europe, which is down nearly 50% from its 2021 peak. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large rounds closed in 2025 also reflect appetite for spinouts in sectors as varied as nuclear energy — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/proxima-fusion-joins-the-club-of-well-funded-nuclear-contenders-with-e130m-series-a/\">Proxima Fusion</a> — and dual-use drones — Quantum Systems, now <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://quantum-systems.com/news/quantum-systems-triples-valuation/\">valued above $3 billion</a>. In many cases, these startups leverage research from specialized labs, which also explains why there is a long tail of European locations capable of producing spinouts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building relationships with hubs outside of Oxbridge and leading countries can also be a way for newcomers to differentiate themselves and find deals. “The Nordic’s research institutions hold extraordinary, untapped potential,” PSV Hafnium’s partners stated in a press release. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PSV Hafnium itself is a spinout from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), but is also making early-stage investments in other Nordic countries. One of its nine checks to date went to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sisusemi.com/\">SisuSemi</a>, a Finnish startup leveraging a decade of research at the University of Turku to bring new surface cleaning tech to the semiconductor industry. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is good news for teams like SisuSemi that there is more funding available to them. It also comes in addition to grants, commercialization support, and improved <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/09/from-spinouts-to-fundraising-to-ma-founders-need-transparent-deal-terms/\">deal terms</a> that contribute to an encouraging environment for Europe’s spinouts. However, one pain point remains: growth capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the report’s authors note, this gap “is not a unique trend to spinouts, but something impacting the entire startup ecosystem in Europe.” Still, it is quite striking that nearly 50% of late-stage funding for European deep tech and life sciences spinouts comes from outside Europe, mainly from the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this share has decreased over the years, Europe won’t be fully reaping the benefits of its investments in talent and research unless this changes more substantially — but that’s a broader issue to be solved.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
