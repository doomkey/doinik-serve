            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb says its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/airbnb-is-quietly-rolling-out-an-ai-customer-service-bot-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">custom-built AI agent</a> is now handling roughly a third of its customer support issues in North America, and it’s preparing to roll out the feature globally. If successful, the company believes that in a year’s time, more than 30% of its total customer support tickets will be handled by AI voice and chat in all the languages where it also employs a human customer service agent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think this is going to be massive because not only does this reduce the cost base of Airbnb customer service, but the quality of service is going to be a huge step change,” CEO Brian Chesky said during the company’s <a href=\"https://investors.airbnb.com/press-releases/news-details/2026/Airbnb-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fourth-quarter earnings</a> call this week. This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/12/airbnb-abnb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">poached from Meta</a> for his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn’t just search for you, but one that “knows you.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” Chesky explained, adding that’s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ahmad is one of the world’s leading AI experts. He spent 16 years at Apple, and most recently led the generative AI team at Meta that built the Llama models. He’s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we’re going to transform the Airbnb experience,” Chesky noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb’s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can’t replicate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A chatbot doesn’t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can’t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,” Chesky told analysts during the earnings call. Instead, he pitched the idea of layering AI over the Airbnb experience, which he claimed would help to accelerate growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company forecast revenue growth would be in the “low double digits” this year, after pulling in $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/q4-airbnb-abnb-earnings-2025.html\">above estimates </a>of $2.72 billion. This quarter, it expects revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $2.53 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors still wanted to know if AI platforms could be a risk in the long-term, assuming they moved into the short-term rentals market. Chesky, however, pushed back at that idea, saying that Airbnb isn’t just the consumer-facing app; it’s also the host app, the customer service, and the protections it offers, like insurance and user verifications.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve built this over 18 years. We handle more than $100 billion in payments through the platform,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AI chatbots serve a function similar to search, in that they deliver top-of-funnel traffic, he noted. That traffic also converts at a higher rate than traffic from Google, Chesky pointed out, suggesting that the shift to AI would benefit Airbnb.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is already using AI to power its search, with the feature now enabled for a “very small percentage” of Airbnb’s traffic, while it experiments with making its search more conversational. Later, the company plans to integrate sponsored listings within search.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Spotify this week told investors its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/spotify-says-its-best-developers-havent-written-a-line-of-code-since-december-thanks-to-ai/\">best developers hadn’t written a single line of code</a> since December, thanks to AI, Airbnb offered a more high-level metric on its own internal AI adoption. The company said that 80% of its engineers now use AI tools, and it’s working to get that to 100% soon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga did not respond to a request for comment and to provide more information, such as the total number of customers affected. The company says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords. The company did not respond when it was asked if there was no multi-factor on the email account prior to this breach. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo. Tenga sells a variety of sex toys, mostly for men. It’s unclear if the breach affected customers outside of the United States, given that the email came explicitly from Tenga Store USA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga is the latest in a long list of sex toy makers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/sex-toy-maker-lovense-caught-leaking-users-email-addresses-and-exposing-accounts-to-takeovers/\">such as Lovense last year</a>, and adult websites, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/hacking-group-says-its-extorting-pornhub-after-stealing-users-viewing-data/\">Pornhub</a> last year and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/sexting-site-sextpanther-data-exposed/\">SexPanther</a> in 2020, that have been hacked.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But at the time, there was enough backlash for OpenAI to keep the legacy model available for paid subscribers, who could manually choose to interact with that model.

The SEC’s FOIA department said it had identified “approximately 21.7 gigabytes of electronically maintained records” related to the investigation. The agency doesn’t typically make records available if investigations are still open, and it explained in a follow-up email that it “was closed in September 2025.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how far the investigation progressed. The SEC <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/fisker-faces-sec-investigation-as-bankruptcy-case-drags-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed the existence of the probe</a> in an October 2024 filing in Fisker’s bankruptcy case. The agency wrote at the time that it had sent subpoenas to the company and that it may need to “request or subpoena additional documents in the future relating to its ongoing investigation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment. Founder and former CEO Henrik Fisker did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The closure of the Fisker investigation comes amid a significant drop in enforcement actions and settlements during President Trump’s second term. The SEC initiated 313 enforcement actions in 2025 — the lowest in a decade and down 27% from the the final year of President Biden’s term, according to <a href=\"https://www.paulweiss.com/media/mxhbfcx4/sec_enforcement_2025_year_in_review.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an analysis by law firm Paul, Weiss</a>. Only four of those enforcement actions were against public companies. Total monetary settlements fell 45% from 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fisker was one of the last remaining electric vehicle startups under investigation by the SEC. Over the last few years, the agency settled fraud or other charges brought against <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-agrees-83m-sec-settlement-213634419.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nikola</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/lordstown-motors-sec-charged-misleading-investors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lordstown Motors</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/ev-company-canoo-agrees-to-1-5m-settlement-with-sec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Canoo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-sec-settles-fraud-charges-against-hyzon-motors-over-misleading-investors-2023-09-26/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hyzon Motors</a>, and others.

The move highlights New Delhi’s selective engagement with Chinese-linked tech platforms years after it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">imposed sweeping bans</a> on consumer apps and games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, the Indian government’s Startup India initiative <a href=\"https://x.com/startupindia/status/2021522797496005096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the collaboration with Alibaba.com to identify and support Indian startups that can help onboard and scale Indian exporters on the group’s global B2B platform. The program offers commissions and technical support to those startups to assist small manufacturers and traders in reaching overseas markets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new partnership arrives after years of strained India–China relations. New Delhi <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">banned dozens of Chinese-linked apps</a> in 2020 following a deadly border clash, including major platforms such as TikTok, PUBG Mobile, and AliExpress, an e-commerce app operated by Alibaba Group. Those restrictions remain in place, making the Indian government’s public collaboration with Alibaba’s export-focused platform a carefully circumscribed form of engagement rather than a broader policy reset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s export ambitions are closely tied to its small businesses and the platforms they use to reach overseas markets. Micro, small, and medium enterprises account for <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2219984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nearly half of the country’s exports</a> and about 31% of GDP, according to the Indian government’s latest Economic Survey, underlining why New Delhi has focused on expanding digital market access for smaller firms through global B2B channels, including Alibaba.com.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alibaba.com’s B2B platform connects more than 50 million active buyers across over 200 countries and regions, said Rocky Lu, head of India business at the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Alibaba.com has been active in India for over two decades, and we remain dedicated to our core mission of empowering MSMEs to scale their businesses globally,” Lu told TechCrunch. “Our focus continues to be on leveraging our digital infrastructure to help ‘Made in India’ products reach an international audience through digital transformation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu did not confirm whether the Startup India initiative marks Alibaba.com’s first direct partnership with India’s federal government since 2020. He said, however, that the company has “maintained a consistent cadence of engagement with various government and semi-government bodies integral to the Indian export ecosystem,” including through digital training programs for MSMEs and collaborations with export promotion councils.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership reflects India’s differentiated approach toward China, maintaining restrictions in strategic and security-sensitive sectors while allowing economic engagement where there is clear benefit, said Kazim Rizvi, founding director of the New Delhi-based public policy think tank The Dialogue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Going forward, regulatory clarity will be important,” Rizvi told TechCrunch. “Predictable policy environments will help ensure that startups feel confident participating in such initiatives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government seems to be drawing a distinction between export-focused platforms and consumer-facing Chinese apps, said George Chen, partner and co-chair of the digital practice at The Asia Group, a Washington-based consultancy that advises companies on policy and geopolitical risks across Asia. Chen, who previously served as a regional public policy director at Meta, said New Delhi sees value in Alibaba’s role in supporting B2B exports, particularly given the platform’s reach in markets such as Africa, which could help Indian exporters diversify their global sales.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India appears to be drawing lessons from China’s approach to digital platforms, Chen told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“China bans foreign apps like Facebook and Instagram for Chinese individual users but still allows Facebook and Google to do business with Chinese companies, especially exporters who rely on those platforms to sell products abroad,” Chen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Startup India collaboration follows other recent steps by Alibaba.com to expand export-focused services in India. In June 2025, the company <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/alibabacom-launches-trade-assurance-in-india-to-empower-smes-302494114.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched</a> its Trade Assurance program in the country, aimed at helping Indian small and medium-sized exporters manage risks in cross-border transactions through payment protection and dispute-resolution tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The developments also come as India and China show tentative signs of improved engagement in multilateral technology forums, with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/china-india-ai-summit-improving-relations-with-new-delhi.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chinese representatives expected to attend</a> the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">India AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi next week. Indian officials, however, have not indicated any change to restrictions on Chinese consumer technology platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is rolling out new streaming bundles, expanding its $3 subscription service, Howdy, to more platforms, and partnering with more premium streaming services following the successful addition of HBO Max.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launching bundles in 2026 is a smart move, as it could attract more viewers looking for enticing deals amid rising subscription prices. Many streaming platforms have been increasing their rates recently, and Roku aims to appeal to cost-conscious consumers. The positive impact of HBO Max on Roku’s premium subscriptions has encouraged the company to continue this strategy by adding more top-tier partners, which is likely to drive growth going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Roku <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/roku-launches-howdy-a-2-99-ad-free-streaming-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched</a> its ad-free subscription streaming service, Howdy, last year and plans to expand its availability beyond the Roku platform.

The company is also nearing the milestone of 100 million streaming households, though it has decided to report this figure less frequently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Financially, Roku delivered an impressive quarter, posting net income of $80.5 million, a rebound from a $35.5 million loss in the same period last year. Total revenue for Q4 2025 reached $1.4 billion, representing a 16% year-over-year increase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, Roku is optimistic, projecting total net revenue of $5.5 billion and gross profit of $2.4 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In 2023, our priority was to rightsize our cost structure and reach adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2024, and we achieved that goal a full year ahead of schedule,” Wood told investors during the call yesterday afternoon. “Looking ahead to 2026 and beyond, we are confident in our ability to sustain double-digit platform revenue growth while continuing to grow profitability.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It has also rolled out at 10 more schools, including MIT, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania, and Weng says he wants to roll out Date Drop more broadly in some cities this summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our matches convert to actual dates at about 10x the rate of Tinder,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Instead of swiping, we get to know each person deeply and send them one compatible match per week.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At first, Weng didn’t intend to turn Date Drop into the foundation of a startup. Then, a close friend of his met their partner via Date Drop. “That was when I got the sense that this was less of a project,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Weng thinks of Date Drop as just the first service from his startup, The <a href=\"https://www.relationship.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Relationship Company</a>, which is a public benefit corporation — a type of company legally required to consider social impact alongside profits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This started as something I just wanted to exist on campus, and it became a company because people kept on asking for it in their schools and I needed resources to do that,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Already, Weng has raised “a few million” from some angel investors, including Zynga founder and early Facebook backer Mark Pincus, who has taught business courses at Stanford (including to Weng). Andy Chen, a former partner at Coatue, and Elad Gil, an early backer of Airbnb, Stripe, and Pinterest, also invested in The Relationship Company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The long-term vision at The Relationship Company is about facilitating all meaningful relationships: friendships, professional connections, community, events,” Weng said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s par for the course to use algorithms to predict if users of a dating service may be compatible with one another — that’s how dating apps work. But Weng says his model is more geared toward forging long-term connections, with 95% of Date Drop users saying they’re interested in relationships.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3092767\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png 3273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/questionaire.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Date Drop</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weng explains that there are two core elements at play. First, the questionnaire needs to be thorough enough to capture a real picture of who someone is. “We do that through the questions, open-ended responses, a voice conversation, and other data that the users provide,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The next challenge is compatibility prediction. “Because we help people plan dates, we have data on which matches actually work out. So we have a model trained on real-world outcomes,” he said. “Once you have those two components, the actual matching is standard stuff from matching theory literature.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently pursuing a computer science master’s degree at Stanford, Weng has oriented his education around the economic and mathematical concepts of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_theory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">matching</a>. As a Stanford undergrad, he created his own major to study humans, matching, and incentives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I started to see how matching shapes so much of our lives,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Who your life partner is, who your friends are, what college you go to, which company you work for are all matching problems.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond his technical education, Weng found an unexpected class useful for learning to manage a startup: “Intro to Clown.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A core principle of clowning is that clowns are failures, and instead of fearing failure, they revel in it,” he said. “As a product builder, your entire journey is just repeatedly failing and getting back up. Clown class was a wonderful microcosm of that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, The Relationship Company has two employees besides Weng, along with 12 students who serve as campus ambassadors. Because their work revolves around forging matches, Weng has extended that mindset to how he manages the company. He offers employees a $100 monthly “relationship stipend,” which they can spend on dates, gifts, experiences, or anything that helps them deepen an important relationship of any sort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Relationships are the single most important factor in a person’s life,” Weng said. “There’s also great research showing that money spent on other people makes you happier than money spent on yourself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weng’s fascination with how people form relationships has also informed how he goes about his day-to-day life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Date Drop has shown me how many interesting people are out there that you’d never encounter through your normal routines,” he said. “It’s made me more open to people I wouldn’t have crossed paths with otherwise.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This unfortunately required parting ways with some people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the company is “hiring aggressively” and closed with a quintessentially Musk pitch: “Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Losing half your co-founders in a relatively short period raises questions, and Musk’s comments seem designed to control the narrative, reframing the exits as necessary rather than a problem for the outfit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, at least 11 engineers, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/nearly-half-of-xais-founding-team-has-now-left-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two co-founders</a>, have publicly announced their departure from xAI in the past week — though two of those exits appear to have occurred a few weeks ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three of the departing staff members have said they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others have hinted at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, <a href=\"https://x.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/2021113745024614671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a post</a> announcing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shayan Salehian, who worked on product infrastructure and model behavior post-training at xAI and previously worked at Twitter/X, <a href=\"https://x.com/shayan_/status/2020240890233807232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said last week</a> he was leaving to “start something new.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vahid Kazemi, who had a brief stint working on machine learning, <a href=\"https://x.com/vahidk/status/2021392140933402976?s=46&amp;t=Epl8sTZrKzZ5ctcw3cgciw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted Tuesday</a> that he left a few weeks ago, adding: “IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring … So, I’m starting something new.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roland Gavrilescu, a former xAI engineer, left in November to start Nuraline, a company building “forward-deployed AI agents,” but posted again on Tuesday that he left the firm to build “something new with others that left xAI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The departures come at a moment of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/among-the-worst-weve-seen-report-slams-xais-grok-over-child-safety-failures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">significant controversy</a> for xAI. The company is facing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">regulatory scrutiny</a> after Grok created nonconsensual explicit deepfakes of women and children that were disseminated on X — <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/paris-prosecutors-raid-x-offices-as-part-of-investigation-over-child-abuse-images-deepfakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">French authorities last week raided X</a> offices as part of an investigation. The company is also moving toward a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">planned IPO</a> later this year, after being <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legally acquired by SpaceX</a> last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk is also facing personal controversy after files published by the Justice Department show extended conversations with convicted rapist and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The emails show Musk <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/expressed-interest-visiting-jeffrey-epstein-island-emails-show-doj-rcna256784\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discussing a visit to Epstein’s island</a> on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013. Epstein was first convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI maintains a headcount of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-org-chart-employees-elon-musk-direct-reports-2025-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 1,000 employees</a>, so the departures are unlikely to affect the company’s short-term capabilities. Still, the rapid pace of the recent departures had taken on a life of its own online, with users jokingly announcing on X that they too are “leaving xAI” despite never having worked there — a sign of how quickly the narrative of a “mass exodus” snowballed on Musk’s social network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, forced co-founder exits are rarely a sign of smooth scaling. While Musk frames the reorganization as calculated, the fact that several engineers followed the co-founders out the door — and that at least three are starting something new together — suggests the departures may also reflect deeper tensions. In frontier AI, where talent is scarce and reputation matters, xAI’s ability to attract and retain top researchers will be tested as it competes with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-timeline-of-departure-announcements\">Timeline of departure announcements</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The following employees have publicly announced their departures from xAI on X in recent days:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>February 6:  </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/ayushjaiswal/status/2019857451823296876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ayush Jaiswal</a>, engineer, wrote: “This was my last week at xAI.

(Flock maintains that it <a href=\"https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/does-flock-share-data-with-ice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">does not explicitly</a> work with ICE.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ring wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-and-flock-cancel-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> that it made a joint decision with Flock to cancel the partnership because the integration would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This news comes less than a week after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheUzrXsKrY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ring’s Super Bowl ad</a> aired, which showed how its AI-powered Search Party feature could use a network of neighborhood cameras to find lost dogs.

At the time, Bailey said he created the app to encourage partners to talk more about personal finance since doing so is often uncomfortable for many people. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fifty-four percent of people say a partner’s debt is a reason to consider divorce,” Bailey told TechCrunch. “Financial compatibility is quietly one of the most important relationship factors, yet no dating platform addresses it directly.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app had its fair share of critics, and many people indeed called it classist because of its focus on those who handle money well. Still, the app, which was supposed to be available for 90 days, became so popular that Bailey kept it around for six months. It amassed 50,000 users and made headlines worldwide for its premise. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/score-the-dating-app-for-people-with-good-to-excellent-credit-quietly-shuts-down/\">it went away</a>, and all went back to normal in the world of dating. Until Friday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bailey told TechCrunch that he’s decided <a href=\"https://scoredating.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to officially bring Score back — for good, this time. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We originally released Score to integrate financial responsibility into something people deeply value — love,” Bailey said. “When we shut it down, we assumed the conversation would continue without us. It didn’t.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?w=383\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3092616\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=675,1200 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=720,1280 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=242,430 242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=405,720 405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=506,900 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=450,800 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=376,668 376w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=211,375 211w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=347,617 347w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=299,531 299w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Score-APP.002.png?resize=28,50 28w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Score</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, he said people kept asking him why he shut it down. “Academics have even reached out wanting to study behavior impact,” he continued. “It became clear this wasn’t just a viral moment. It tapped into something unresolved in relationship culture.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This time around, Score will be available on the iOS App Store (last time it was just a mobile app, he said, because he and his team built it so quickly). Bailey also said this version of the app will be more inclusive, having taken into account the feedback that it was too exclusive. “So now, everyone can join.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There will be two tiers: the basic tier, where no ID or credit verification is required, and anyone can browse and connect. And then the verified tier, where members must verify their ID and credit score to unlock premium features. The app uses Equifax to verify both identity and credit scores, with users giving consent for the app to do so. It does only what Bailey described as a soft pull, so there is no impact to credit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t store full credit reports or sensitive personal and financial data. We simply receive confirmation that someone meets the Verified criteria,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The verified plan includes features that let people see other members nearby, see who has saved their profile, send video intros to potential matches, and send messages to users before they’ve swiped back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’s still bullish on using credit scores, saying that it’s not a measure of wealth but rather one of consistency. “Banks look for the same thing in customers that we look for in relationships — consistency and reliability,” he said. “Dating apps measure attrition. We measure attrition plus accountability.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bailey said the app doesn’t store any sensitive data, doesn’t sell personal data, and secures everything using an encrypted infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The last iteration of Score amassed a lot of data on its users, helping show how each generation has been affected by socioeconomic factors. For example, it found that millennial men had credit scores about 11% higher than those of women. But for Gen Zers, that gap was much smaller, with men having a credit score only 3% higher. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ll be watching how that data [has] evolved,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The original Score was a U.S.-only experiment, he said, but this time, the company plans a global expansion, starting with Canada. Keep an eye out for some partnerships, too, he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Financial behavior is one of the strongest predictors of life stability,” Bailey said. “We believe compatibility algorithms should reflect that.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Plasmas inside the company’s Polaris prototype reactor have reached 150 million degrees Celsius, three-quarters of the way toward what the company thinks it will need to operate a commercial fusion power plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re obviously really excited to be able to get to this place,” David Kirtley, Helion’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Polaris is also operating using deuterium-tritium fuel — a mixture of two hydrogen isotopes — which Kirtley said makes Helion the first fusion company to do so. “We were able to see the fusion power output increase dramatically as expected in the form of heat,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Everett, Washington-based startup is locked in a race with several other companies that are seeking to commercialize fusion power, a potentially unlimited source of clean energy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That potential has investors rushing to bet on the technology. This week, Inertia Enterprises announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/twilio-co-founders-fusion-power-startup-raises-450m-from-bessemer-and-alphabets-gv/\">$450 million Series A</a> round that included Bessemer and GV. In January, Type One Energy told TechCrunch it was in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/bill-gates-backed-type-one-energy-raises-87m-ahead-of-250m-series-b/\">midst of raising $250 million</a>, while last summer Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">$863 million</a> from investors including Google and Nvidia. Helion itself raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">$425 million</a> last year from a group that included Sam Altman, Mithril, Lightspeed, and SoftBank.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While most other fusion startups are targeting the early 2030s to put electricity on the grid, Helion has a contract with Microsoft to sell it electricity starting in 2028, though that power would come from a larger commercial reactor called Orion that the company is currently building, not Polaris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every fusion startup has its own milestones based on the design of its reactor. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, needs to heat its plasmas to more than 100 million degrees C inside of its tokamak, a doughnut-shaped device that uses powerful magnets to contain the plasma.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helion’s reactor is different, needing plasmas that are about twice as hot to function as intended. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s reactor design is what’s called a field-reversed configuration. The inside chamber looks like an hourglass, and at the wide ends, fuel gets injected and turned into plasmas. Magnets then accelerate the plasmas toward each other. When they first merge, they’re around 10 million to 20 million degrees C. Powerful magnets then compress the merged ball further, raising the temperature to 150 million degrees C. It all happens in less than a millisecond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of extracting energy from the fusion reactions in the form of heat, Helion uses the fusion reaction’s own magnetic field to generate electricity. Each pulse will push back against the reactor’s own magnets, inducing electrical current that can be harvested. By harvesting electricity directly from the fusion reactions, the company hopes to be more efficient than its competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last year, Kirtley said that Helion had refined some of the circuits in the reactor to boost how much electricity they recover.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company uses deuterium-tritium fuel today, down the road it plans to use deuterium-helium-3. Most fusion companies plan to use deuterium-tritium and extract energy as heat. Helion’s fuel choice, deuterium-helium-3, produces more charged particles, which push forcefully against the magnetic fields that confine the plasma, making it better suited for Helion’s approach of generating electricity directly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helion’s ultimate goal is to produce plasmas that hit 200 million degrees C, far higher than other companies’ targets, a function of its reactor design and fuel choice. “We believe that at 200 million degrees, that’s where you get into that optimal sweet spot of where you want to operate a power plant,” Kirtley said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked whether Helion had reached scientific breakeven — the point where a fusion reaction generates more energy than it requires to start it — Kirtley demurred. “We focus on the electricity piece, making electricity, rather than the pure scientific milestones.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helium-3 is common on the moon, but not here on Earth, so Helion must make its own fuel. To start, it’ll fuse deuterium nuclei to produce the first batches. In regular operation, while the main source of power will be deuterium-helium-3 fusion, some of the reactions will still be deuterium-on-deuterium, which will produce helium-3 that the company will purify and reuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Work is already underway to refine the fuel cycle. “It’s been a pleasant surprise in that a lot of that technology has been easier to do than maybe we expected,” Kirtley said. Helion has been able to produce helium-3 “at very high efficiencies in terms of both throughput and purity,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Helion is currently the only fusion startup using helium-3 in its fuel, Kirtley said he thinks other companies will in the future, hinting that he’d be open to selling it to them. “Other folks — as they come along and recognize that they want to do this approach of direct electricity recovery and see the efficiency gains from it — will want to be using helium-3 fuel as well,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside its experiments with Polaris, Helion is also building Orion, a 50-megawatt fusion reactor it needs to fulfill its Microsoft contract. “Our ultimate goal is not to build and deliver Polaris,” Kirtley said. “That’s a step along the way towards scaled power plants.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Waymo vehicles represent technological breakthroughs that once seemed unfathomable. The Alphabet-owned company just raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-to-scale-robotaxi-fleet-london-tokyo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$16 billion</a> to take its driverless cars international!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Waymo and DoorDash confirmed to TechCrunch that this Reddit post is legitimate. This is, in fact, a real problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” Waymo and DoorDash said in a joint response. (The door-closing partnership, which began <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/waymo-is-getting-doordashers-to-close-doors-on-self-driving-cars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earlier this year</a>, is just one facet of Waymo and DoorDash’s broader relationship. In October, the companies launched an autonomous delivery service in Phoenix, where Waymo vehicles deliver food and groceries to DoorDash customers.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If a Waymo door is left open, it’s worth it to the company to pay someone to close it — the car cannot complete any more rides if it’s left immobile. Not to mention, an unmoving car could block the flow of traffic. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t the first time Waymo has enlisted help with its door troubles.

But for now, gig workers are Waymo’s best bet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to third-party data, ChatGPT sees 75 billion searches per month, while Pinterest sees 80 billion searches and generates 1.7 billion monthly clicks, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That makes us one of the largest search destinations in the world. And importantly, more than half of those searches are commercial in nature, compared to, I think . . . approximately 2% [of ChatGPT searches],” Ready added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pinterest in the fourth quarter missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per share, reporting $1.32 billion in revenue versus $1.33 billion expected, and earnings per share of 67 cents, compared to the 69 cents projected. It also forecast that first-quarter 2026 sales will come in between $951 million to $971 million, below the $980 million expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company blamed its shortfall on larger advertisers pulling back on spend, particularly in Europe, and a new furniture tariff implemented in October that caused issues within the home category. It said those trends could worsen in the first quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Surprisingly, Pinterest missed on earnings despite a user base that’s growing faster than expected. The company reported monthly active users were up 12% year-over-year to 619 million, when Wall Street had forecast 613 million users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shares <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/pinterest-pins-q4-earnings-report-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped</a> 20% in after-hours trading.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pinterest has long struggled to translate the high usage of its platform into ad dollars, as its users often go to Pinterest to plan and dream, not shop and buy. That challenge could become even more acute in the AI era, especially if advertisers shift their dollars to platforms where intent to buy is clearer — such as chatbot requests that ask for product recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked about how Pinterest will navigate the shift toward AI-powered shopping, Ready pointed to the company’s visual search, discovery, and personalization features, which he said would point users to relevant products when they open the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re helping them complete those commercial journeys without having to type in a single prompt,” he said, also noting that Pinterest had benefited from an easier checkout flow that came from its partnership with Amazon. He said customers didn’t yet seem ready to allow an AI to make a purchase on their behalf, but said Pinterest would be ready if that time came.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’ll actually be one of the easiest parts of the commercial journey to solve,” he claimed. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
