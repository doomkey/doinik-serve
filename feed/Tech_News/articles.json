OpenAI also shared that it now has 50 million paying subscribers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Subscriber momentum accelerated meaningfully to start the year, with January and February on track to be the largest months for new subscribers in our history,” the company wrote in a blog post. “People use ChatGPT to learn, write, plan, and build. As usage scales, the product improves in ways people feel immediately: faster responses, higher reliability, stronger safety, and more consistent performance.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The figure marks a jump of 100 million users from the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/\">800 million</a> OpenAI reported in October 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI shared the new numbers as part of its announcement that it has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/openai-raises-110b-in-one-of-the-largest-private-funding-rounds-in-history/\">raised $110 billion</a> in private funding, marking one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding includes a $50 billion investment from Amazon, along with $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, at a $730 billion pre-money valuation. The round remains open, and the company expects more investors to join. <br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-music-startup-suno-settles-lawsuit/\">settled its lawsuit</a> and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&amp;B song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">How Was I Supposed to Know</a>” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3 million</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, many musicians have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/nicki-minaj-billie-eilish-katy-perry-and-other-musicians-sign-letter-against-irresponsible-ai/\">spoken out</a> against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Hkq2C4Wr9rhr0OV9hOfNI4oA4y?domain=perplexity.ai\">example workflows</a> on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial or legal data, creating analysis, and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity executives invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097675\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg 3799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=768,398 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1200,621 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1280,663 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=430,223 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=720,373 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=900,466 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=800,414 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1536,795 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=2048,1060 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=668,346 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=1192,617 1192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=708,367 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Datavis_V2.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Perplexity</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It already seems like forever ago since “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/21/pokemon-scarlet-violet-preview/\">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>” came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the “Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen” games today for the Switch… but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/retro-game-emulator-delta-app-store-ios/\">extremely easy and legally dubious</a> way to get those games on your phone for free. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case.

Now the agency has replaced its top acting leader, a CISA spokesperson tells TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move to replace Madhu Gottumukkala as the acting director of CISA, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity and technical protection across the federal government, comes after a tumultuous year serving as the agency’s top boss.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gottumukkala struggled to lead the agency during his tenure as acting director and caused <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/trumps-acting-cybersecurity-chief-uploaded-sensitive-government-docs-to-chatgpt/\">security headaches</a>, including the uploading of sensitive government documents to ChatGPT, according to reports.

Similar to the streaming giant’s Music and Podcast Charts, the Audiobook Charts will be updated weekly and highlight the top audiobooks overall and by genre. These rankings are based on listening behavior and engagement on the streaming service, the company says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new charts are accessible to both free and paying users within the audiobooks hub. You can find them by tapping the search button in the app and selecting the “Audiobooks” tile to enter the hub. Then, you need to scroll down to the “Dive deeper” section to find the charts. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move marks Spotify’s latest investment in the audiobooks space, following its official support of the format in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, Spotify has continued investing in audiobooks with additional features like the recently launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\">“Page Match” tool</a>, which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps,” which are short audio summaries to catch you up on what you’ve already read so far.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says the new Audiobook Charts will benefit both readers and authors by giving listeners a trusted way to discover popular titles, while also creating new opportunities for authors and the publishing industry to reach wider audiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we’ve proven with Music and Podcasts Charts, when content is easier to access, discover, and enjoy, the demand grows,” said Duncan Bruce, Spotify’s director of Audiobook Partnerships and Licensing, in the <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-02-27/audiobook-charts-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “We are delighted to now bring that to audiobooks, to help provide even more ways for users, publishers, and authors to discover what’s trending on Spotify, and make books more connected with culture in real time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Spotify isn’t only interested in audiobooks, as the streaming giant also recently ventured into physical book sales. Spotify announced earlier this month that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/spotify-ventures-into-physical-book-sales-adds-new-audiobook-features/\">purchase physical copies</a> of books directly within the app through a partnership with Bookshop.org.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

More than 30 employees participated at the same valuation, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal is leading the funding round, followed by Steadview Capital, according to regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch. Other investors include Peak XV Partners, InfoEdge Ventures, and Dharana Capital, alongside angel investors such as Vijay Shekhar Sharma of Paytm, Kunal Shah of CRED, Nithin Kamath and Nikhil Kamath of Zerodha, as well as current and former Eternal executives including Akshant Goyal, Aditya Mangla, Kunal Swarup, Akriti Chopra, and Rahul Ganjoo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal stepped down as chief executive of Zomato and its parent, Eternal, in January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/eternal-ceo-deepinder-goyal-hands-over-reins-to-blinkit-chief-as-quick-commerce-takes-off/\">handing the role to</a> Albinder Dhindsa, who leads the quick-commerce unit Blinkit. The move marked a major transition for Goyal after nearly two decades at the helm of the food delivery company he co-founded in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Temple is one of the clearest expressions yet of that shift. The startup is focused on building a high-performance wearable for elite athletes, an area Goyal has described as ripe for deeper technological innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a January conversation with podcaster Raj Shamani, Goyal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xik34jh-doc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described</a> Temple’s wearable as a sensor designed to sit on the wearer’s temple and continuously track cerebral blood flow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a separate post on X earlier Friday, he said Temple <a href=\"https://x.com/deepigoyal/status/2027256222660133375\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">aims to build</a> what he called “the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes,” claiming the device would measure metrics that existing wearables cannot. He also outlined an expansive hiring push spanning embedded systems, computational neuroscience, and brain-computer interface engineering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is entering an increasingly crowded and well-funded wearables market, where companies such as Whoop, Oura, and Garmin have spent years refining devices that track sleep, recovery, and athletic performance. Whether Temple can meaningfully differentiate its technology remains an open question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push into Temple is part of a broader shift in Goyal’s investment focus. In October 2025, he said he had <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/deepinder-goyal-expands-continue-research-with-25-million-fund-to-back-longevity-researchers/articleshow/124780807.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">committed $25 million</a> of his own capital to another new venture, Continue Research, which is exploring ways to extend human lifespan. He is also a co-founder of aviation startup LAT Aerospace, which recently expanded into defense technology with the acquisition of early-stage firm Sharang Shakti.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal built his reputation at Zomato, which he co-founded with Pankaj Chaddah and spent nearly two decades building into one of India’s largest food delivery platforms before stepping down as chief executive earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chaddah exited the company in 2018, as Zomato continued to consolidate its position through acquisitions, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">purchase of Uber Eats’ India business</a> in 2020 and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/zomato-blinkit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">grocery delivery platform Blinkit</a> — then known as Grofers — for $568 million in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before Temple, Goyal had also backed health and fitness startups, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/ultrahuman-unveils-new-smart-ring-as-it-awaits-u-s-clearance-after-oura-dispute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ultrahuman</a>, an India-based wearable maker that competes with Oura’s smart ring, underscoring his growing focus on performance and health technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal declined to comment further on Temple.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the round remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join as it proceeds.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s previous round closed in March 2025, raising $40 billion against a $300 billion valuation. At the time, it was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/openai-closes-40-billion-in-funding-the-largest-private-fundraise-in-history-softbank-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the largest private funding round on record</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/amazon-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon partnership</a>, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon’s Bedrock platform</a>. The company will also expand its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/aws-and-openai-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously announced AWS partnership</a>, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Trainium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have lots of developers and companies eager to run services powered by OpenAI models on AWS,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement, “and our unique collaboration with OpenAI to provide stateful runtime environments will change what’s possible for customers building AI apps and agents.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Information had <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazons-50-billion-investment-openai-hinge-ipo-agi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported</a> that $35 billion of Amazon’s investment could be contingent on the company either achieving AGI or making its IPO by the end of the year. OpenAI’s announcement confirms the funding split, but says only that the additional $35 billion will arrive “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia’s participation in the round has been the subject of intense speculation, particularly as reports of a $100 billion investment in September gave way to reports of a smaller investment in the months that followed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/31/nvidia-ceo-pushes-back-against-report-that-his-companys-100b-openai-investment-has-stalled/\">In January,</a> Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed the idea that Nvidia was backing away from OpenAI, saying, “we will invest a great deal of money. I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Google has so far provided maps services in South Korea using high-resolution, 1:5,000 scale map data, but without the ability to export that data to its servers, the company couldn’t offer features like turn-by-turn navigation or detailed listings for businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea has resisted Google’s appeals since 2011, arguing that the company’s precise satellite maps could endanger national security by exposing sensitive military sites when combined with commercial imagery and online data.  Given that South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea, the government is cautious about exposing such locations, and had until now demanded Google set up a data center in the country and obscure sensitive locations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The green light comes with <a href=\"https://www.molit.go.kr/USR/NEWS/m_72/dtl.jsp?id=95091751\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">strict rules</a> designed to protect sensitive military and infrastructure sites. The South Korean government will verify compliance before any data leaves the country; any images of South Korean territory used in Google Maps and Google Earth must comply with national security regulations; and historical imagery in Google Earth and Street View must obscure sensitive military sites. Google is also required to either remove or limit coordinate data for South Korean locations, and only essential data for navigation and routing can be exported.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also requires all data processing to be done on servers operated by Google’s local partners. Sensitive topographic and military data remain off-limits, and any updates to military or security sites must be carried out promptly on domestic servers at the government’s request. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move will no doubt send ripples through Korea’s domestic maps market, which has seen local navigation apps such as Naver Map, T Map, and Kakao Map thrive in the relative absence of providers like Google or Apple. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its announcement, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said the decision was influenced by its intention to boost tourism in the country — because Google Maps has until now proved a bit useless in Korea, tourists have had to rely on local apps, whether or not they offer English language support. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ministry said the move is also aimed at strengthening the country’s geospatial industry by supporting the development of high-precision, 3D infrastructure and geo AI technologies. The government is urging Google to help grow South Korea’s geospatial industry so that exporting the data benefits not just the tech giant, but also domestic innovation and economic growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has not yet said if it would set up a data center in South Korea. The company operates <a href=\"https://www.datacentermap.com/c/google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an array of data centers</a> in Asia, including in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also outlined new measures to handle potential security incidents related to the export of high-resolution maps. The ministry said it would work with Google to set up a “security incident prevention and response framework” to manage potential risks before any data leaves the country. For situations involving imminent threats to national security, a technical “red button” mechanism will be implemented, allowing for rapid emergency response. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, South Korea will require a local officer to be stationed in-country to maintain constant communication with the government and ensure smooth handling of any security incidents.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It will be available for preorders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-itc-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ruled in Oura’s favor</a> in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In August 2025, Ultrahuman also <a href=\"https://blog.ultrahuman.com/blog/ultrahuman-files-patent-infringement-suit-against-oura/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a separate patent infringement case</a> against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It <a href=\"https://cyborg.ultrahuman.com/press-releases/ultrahuman-delivers-record-fy25-profits-as-subscription-engine-accelerates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported $64 million</a> in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kumar said Jade is designed to move beyond retrospective health summaries toward real-time, actionable guidance.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097658\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=1200,625 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=1280,667 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=430,224 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=720,375 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=900,469 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=800,417 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=1536,800 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=668,348 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=1185,617 1185w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=708,369 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ultrahuman-jade.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Ultrahuman’s Jade AI system</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ultrahuman</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most AI tools today look backward at your data,” he said. “Jade is built to react to your health in real time and surface actions users can take.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kumar said Jade will be available to all Ultrahuman users, including those using the older Ring Air, and does not currently require a subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Ring Pro features a redesigned heart-rate sensing architecture for improved signal quality during sleep and a new dual-core processor to enhance data accuracy and on-device computing.

Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman’s key growth markets include the U.K., Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Separate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Discovery is over. David Ellison-owned Paramount will acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery <a href=\"https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2026/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Determines-Revised-Proposal-from-Paramount-Skydance-Constitutes-a-Company-Superior-Proposal/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/netflix-submits-amended-all-cash-offer-warner-bros-wins-board-support-2026-01-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">all-cash bid</a> for the legacy studio, and <a href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">would walk away from the deal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/g-s1-103282/cbs-chief-bari-weiss-pulls-60-minutes-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shelved</a> or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix had announced its intent to <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquire</a> WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paramount will take on the about $33 billion in debt held by Warner Bros. Discovery, according to the deal. Larry Ellison, whose net worth is $201 billion, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/lawrence-j-ellison/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Bloomberg</a>, has agreed to supply the additional equity to fulfill Paramount’s bid. Paramount’s market cap is about $12 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is also being financed by a $57.5 billion <a href=\"https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-comments-warner-bros-discovery-boards-determination-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">debt commitment</a> from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix shares jumped as much as 10% in after-hours trading in New York.

Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Dorsey <a href=\"https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/jack-dorseys-block-to-lay-off-4-000-employees-in-ai-remake-28f0d869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">half</a> its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for severance, Dorsey told U.S. employees who are being cut that they will receive “your salary for 20 weeks + 1 week per year of tenure, equity vested through the end of [M]ay, 6 months of health care, your corporate devices, and $5,000 to put toward whatever you need to help you in this transition.” Employees outside the U.S. will receive “similar support” dependent on their countries’ policies, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce and Amazon are among a growing list of other companies that have made <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/salesforce-ceo-confirms-4000-layoffs-because-i-need-less-heads-with-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">enormous</a> staffing <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/amazon-layoffs-anti-bureaucracy-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cuts</a> citing the increased gains they are seeing from AI, though a Forrester Research report last month <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-impact-ai-jobs-forecast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cast some doubt</a> on how real those gains are versus the likelihood that many layoffs are financially driven.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Pentagon <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">believes</a> it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-wont-budge-as-pentagon-escalates-ai-dispute/\">deadline</a> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. An Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch Amodei’s statement does not mean the firm is walking away from negotiations and is continuing to engage in good faith with the Department going forward. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The contract language we received overnight from the Department of War made virtually no progress on preventing Claude’s use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons,” an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch. “New language framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will. Despite DOW’s recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Department of Defense has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/\">attempted to force Amodei’s hand</a> by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters—with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei said. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TLDR, he’s saying: “We can just part ways. There’s no need to be nasty about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated with a statement from an Anthropic spokesperson. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
