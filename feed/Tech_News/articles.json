In the initial aftermath of the acquisition, as users fretted over what <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-pay-verified-twitter-misinformation/\">direction</a> Twitter would take, millions of users hopped over to Mastodon, a fellow microblogging site. As time went on, users would also try out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/\">Bluesky</a>, or Instagram’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/threads-now-has-more-than-400-million-monthly-active-users/\">Threads</a> app — but because Mastodon was founded in 2016, it had years to develop its own identity as more than just an alternate Twitter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-mastodon\">What is Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon was founded in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or any other popular social media site, Mastodon is a nonprofit, meaning that, ideally, its goal is to benefit the public, rather than shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon might look like a Twitter clone at first glance, but the underlying system behind the microblogging platform is far more complex. The service is decentralized (no, not in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/decentralized-finance/\">blockchain</a> way), describing itself as a “federated network which operates in a similar way to email.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you first create your account, you choose a server — similar to how you choose to open an email account on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or wherever — which generates your profile’s address. So, for example, if you sign up for Mastodon via the climate justice server, then your address will be @[your username]@climatejustice.social. But no matter which server you sign up with, you will be able to communicate with users from any other server, just like how Gmail users email Hotmail users and vice versa. However, some servers might have blocked other servers (perhaps if it’s an unsavory group), which would mean you can’t communicate with anyone from the blocked server.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-mastodon-lingo\">The Mastodon lingo</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon users generally refer to individual communities as “<a href=\"https://mastodon.help/instances/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">instances</a>” or servers<strong>. </strong>These Mastodon servers can be run by individuals, groups or organizations that each have their own set of rules regarding how users can sign up, as well as their own moderation policies. Some servers let anyone join, while others are invite-only or require approval by an admin. For example, a server for professional scientists asks applicants to include a link to their research to demonstrate that they are, indeed, professionals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Choosing which server to register your account with might seem stressful, but it’s possible to move your account later, so don’t worry. Plus, you can follow people regardless of which server they’re on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You may also hear Mastodon described as part of the “<a href=\"https://fediverse.party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fediverse</a>,” or an interconnected web of various social media services. You know how having a Twitter account doesn’t mean you can use that account on Instagram? Through the Fediverse, your single Mastodon account also grants you access to other decentralized social networks, if that interests you.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You may ocassionally see Mastodon’s equivalent of tweets being referred to as “toots,” but this is fading out of favor (since it’s kind of silly!). Many people are just calling them “posts” these days, but “toot” is often found referenced in older third-party clients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon supports a number of Twitter conventions like replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hashtags. For a while, Mastodon made <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/99662106175542726\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">an intentional choice</a> not to make a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/mastodon-rolls-out-quote-posts-with-protections-to-prevent-dunking/\">quote tweet-like feature</a>, since it can encourage dogpiling criticism, but the platform relented and rolled out that feature in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span> In addition, Mastodon lists work slightly differently from Twitter as you can only add people to a list if you’re already following them. And Direct messages on Mastodon are just @username posts, not private messages coming to a DM inbox</span> — just remember to change the visibility settings if you want that message to stay between the two of you.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-2437890 size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2437890\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=768,769 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=616,617 616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=530,531 530w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fediverse </a><span class=\"screen-reader-text\"><a href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">(opens in a new window)</a></span></span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\">Fediverse <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-mean-that-mastodon-is-open-source\">What does it mean that Mastodon is open source?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone can download, modify and install Mastodon on their own server — plus, the developers of the platform don’t own the copyright.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That doesn’t mean that you can grab Mastodon’s code without acknowledging the source, though. Former President Donald Trump’s social media platform, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/21/trumps-truth-social-app-launch-store-errors/\">Truth Social</a>, initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/\">launched with Mastodon code</a> and passed it off as if it were original software. Mastodon <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">did not take kindly</a> to that.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-create-a-mastodon-account\">How do you create a Mastodon account?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you arrive on the <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mastodon</a> website, you can click a button called “create account,” which directs you to <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a page listing servers to choose from</a>. You can filter these by various factors, like region, language, topic, sign-up speed and more. There, find a server that piques your interest and join — if it’s a server that requires you to be approved, you might need to wait a bit. From there, you can start finding people to follow, regardless of whether they’re registered via your same server.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In effort to minimize confusion on new users picking a server, Mastodon made changes amid the “Twitter exodus” so that it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/mastodon-now-has-a-simpler-sign-up-process/\">easier to create an account</a>. Now, when you go to sign up, it will give an easy option to create an account on mastodon.social instead of choosing a server.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-decide-which-mastodon-server-to-join\">How do you decide which Mastodon server to join?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon’s website has <a href=\"https://mastodon.help/instances/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">helpful resources</a> — but it’s still a bit overwhelming and challenging to find a home base that aligns with your interests. Ask friends who are already on Mastodon if they have suggestions! Or just join somewhere random, because you can always <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">change your server affiliation later</a> once you get into the swing of things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-you-talk-to-people-on-other-mastodon-servers-besides-your-own\">Can you talk to people on other Mastodon servers besides your own?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, you can follow people outside of your local server and reply to their posts. However, when you want to follow someone on a different server, you have to enter their username in the search box on your server to find them first, then follow them. You can’t just go to their profile and click the follow button as you would on Twitter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-the-difference-between-the-home-local-and-federated-timelines\">What’s the difference between the Home, Local and Federated timelines?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Your Home timeline shows you posts from people that you follow, similar to Twitter. The Local timeline shows posts from all users in your server, while the Federated timeline shows you all public posts from users that people in your server follow. (Hint: You can turn on “Slow Mode” in Preferences –&gt; Appearance to hide timeline updates behind a click if things are coming at you too fast!)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-mastodon-s-moderation-policy\">What is Mastodon’s moderation policy?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Individual server admins set their own moderation policies, so you should read the policy on the server you choose to ensure it matches up with your values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon’s user base is a fraction of a percentage of the size of Twitter’s user base. It’s also far less intuitive to navigate, since it hasn’t been designed for a massive global audience like Twitter. That could change in time as more developers join the project in the wake of the Twitter takeover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, for one thing, Mastodon is not owned by Elon Musk… however, it’s going to be difficult in the near-term for Mastodon to replicate the same “watercooler of the world” vibe that Twitter was defined by. Some users might prefer Mastodon to X, though, as it’s more customizable by nature. Unlike X, individual communities have different content guidelines, which provide a variety of different user experiences. And while the user base on Mastodon is smaller, this can lead to more personal and direct conversations, at times, compared with tweeting into the void, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon is what you make of it. Due to its decentralized nature, if you are looking for a more controlled online experience, you can join a server with stricter guardrails against harassment. Some Mastodon features are also built with mitigating harassment in mind. For example, you can only search by hashtag, not by words that appear in a toot. So if you want your post to be discoverable, you can tag it — if you’d rather limit the audience, no one can find your tweet about the Red Sox by simply searching “red sox” if you haven’t tagged it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, a text-based search can surface the posts you’ve written, favorited, boosted or have been mentioned in, which can be useful.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-post-images-and-video\">Can I post images and video?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As noted above, Mastodon supports many Twitter conventions, but its support for media is more limited. Where Twitter supports a variety of media and other data appended to tweets, including its audio-only social “Spaces,” plus photos, video, GIFs, polls, precise location and experimental “Status” tags, Mastodon simply supports images, videos, audio and polls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can<a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@feditips/106228763469320167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> add up to four images to a post</a>, up to eight megabytes in size. Video and audio can be any length, but with a file size limit of 40 megabytes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-post-privately-to-friends\">Can I post privately to friends?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon offers the ability to set your post’s privacy at the time of writing. Posts can be set to be public to be visible by all; unlisted to make them public but opted out of discovery features; only visible to your followers; or only visible to those users you’ve mentioned.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-get-verified-on-mastodon\">Can I get verified on Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. There’s no universal verification system like on Twitter. Some servers may vet their user sign-ups and you can self-verify, in a way, by adding links to your Mastodon profile that have a specific attribute (rel=”me”) in order to prove you are who you say you are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some servers are having fun with the idea of verification in a less-than-official fashion. For example, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@stux@mstdn.social/109268107226097074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the mstdn.social server lets you add blue-and-white checkmarks</a> and other emoji to your display name if you’d like, which make you look verified, even though these don’t mean anything. (Sort of like Twitter’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/05/twitter-begins-rolling-out-7-99-twitter-blue-plan-with-verification-fewer-ads/\">new verification system</a>! But for free!)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-image-2438206\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2438206\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg 1156w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=430,294 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=720,492 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=900,615 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=800,547 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=668,457 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=549,375 549w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=903,617 903w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=708,484 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@stux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">@stux@mstdn.social <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mastodon.social/@stux\" target=\"_blank\">mastodon.social/@stux <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-mastodon-here-to-stay\">Is Mastodon here to stay?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of summer 2025, Mastodon has under one million monthly active users, and around 10 million registered users — this is to say, Mastodon is much smaller than X which had an estimated 132 million daily active users. Still, not all social networks are created equal, and you might find that you prefer tooting about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TTRPGs</a> in a dedicated server, as opposed to tweeting into a realm of madness. Or, you might find that this decentralized system is confusing, and you’ll just ride out the Muskening on X, or switch to Bluesky, Threads, or something else entirely. Choose your own adventure!</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-i-m-not-sure-i-want-to-leave-x-can-i-cross-post-from-x-to-mastodon\">I’m not sure I want to leave X. Can I cross-post from X to Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, this is possible by way of third-party tools. These require you to authorize your account with Twitter and Mastodon and set up parameters. We’ve had success with <a href=\"https://moa.party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Moa Party</a>, which allows you to get specific as to which tweets or retweets are cross-posted. But other tools are available, including <a href=\"https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mastodon Twitter Crossposter</a>, which is also available here on <a href=\"https://github.com/renatolond/mastodon-twitter-poster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, this is also possible with third-party tools. We’ve seen many Mastodon users trying out tools like <a href=\"https://fedifinder.glitch.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fedifinder</a>, <a href=\"https://twitodon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Twitodon</a> and <a href=\"https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Debirdify</a>, for example.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-mastodon-work-with-bluesky-and-threads\">Does Mastodon work with Bluesky and Threads?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a no for Bluesky — not unless <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-app-trying-to-replace-twitter/\">Bluesky</a> chooses to adopt the ActivityPub protocol Mastodon uses. But Bluesky is not planning to integrate with ActivityPub, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1511811083954102273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">having decided to build its own</a> networking protocol. There is some <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33252108\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">skepticism</a> among the developer and open source community about whether or not Bluesky’s decision to go its own way is really about its own protocol’s advantages or if it’s more about producing a spec it could eventually control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Threads, however, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/21/networking-traffic/threads-has-entered-the-fediverse/\">supports</a> ActivityPub.

According to a new Morgan Stanley analysis <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71e12f85-1edb-4156-8cb5-3fe8aef36d93\">reported</a> by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 European banking jobs could vanish by 2030 as lenders lean into AI and shutter physical branches. That’s roughly 10% of the workforce at 35 major banks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bloodletting will hit hardest in back-office operations, risk management, and compliance, the unglamorous guts of banking where algorithms are believed capable of tearing through spreadsheets faster and more effectively than humans. Banks are salivating over projected efficiency gains of 30%, according to the Morgan Stanley report.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The downsizing isn’t confined to Europe. Goldman Sachs had warned U.S. employees in October of job cuts and a hiring freeze through the end of 2025 as part of an AI push dubbed “OneGS 3.0” that’s targeting everything from client onboarding to regulatory reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some institutions are already swinging the axe. Dutch lender ABN Amro plans to cut a fifth of its staff by 2028, while Société Générale’s CEO has declared “nothing is sacred.” Still, some European banking leaders are urging caution, with a JPMorgan Chase exec telling the FT that if junior bankers never learn the fundamentals, it could come back to haunt the industry.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

According to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ramps-audio-ai-efforts-ahead-device?rc=omehqc\">new reporting</a> from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed — toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Smart speakers have already made voice assistants a fixture in more than a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.technavio.com/report/smart-home-speaker-market-industry-in-us-analysis\">third</a> of U.S. homes. Meta just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/metas-ai-glasses-can-now-help-you-hear-conversations-better/\">rolled out a feature</a> for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms — essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/google-tests-audio-overviews-for-search-queries/\">Audio Overviews</a>” that transform search results into conversational summaries, and Tesla is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-is-coming-to-tesla-vehicles-next-week-says-elon-musk/\">integrating</a> xAI’s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to create a conversational voice assistant that handles everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not just the tech giants placing this bet. A motley crew of startups has emerged with the same conviction, albeit with varying degrees of success. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">cautionary tale</a>. The Friend AI pendant, a necklace that claims it will record your life and offer companionship, has sparked privacy concerns and existential dread in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/magazine/friend-wearable-ai-companion.html\">equal measure</a>. And now at least two companies, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">Sandbar</a> and one helmed by Pebble founder <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/?_thumbnail_id=3073860\">Eric Migicovsky</a>, are building AI rings expected to debut in 2026, allowing wearers to literally talk to the hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The form factors may differ, but the thesis is the same: audio is the interface of the future. Every space — your home, your car, even your face — is becoming a control surface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you’re talking, which is something today’s models can’t manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of this is hugely surprising. As The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI’s hardware efforts through the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">$6.5 billion acquisition</a> in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to “right the wrongs” of past consumer gadgets.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It is a phenomenon that cycles in and out of fashion, and right now it is certainly having a moment amid the AI boom.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This trend is particularly evident during Y Combinator <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/the-9-most-sought-after-startups-from-yc-demo-day/\">Demo Days</a>, where founders are increasingly touting their dropout status in their one-minute pitches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t believe YC formally tracks dropout status but, anecdotally, in recent batches, I was struck by how many founders highlight being a dropout from college, grad school, and even high school,” said Katie Jacobs Stanton, founder and general partner <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/moxxie-ventures-led-by-ex-twitter-media-head-raises-95m-third-fund/\">of Moxxie Ventures</a>. “Being a dropout is a kind of credential in itself, reflecting a deep conviction and commitment to building. I think it’s perceived as something quite positive in the venture ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young, most still opted to stay for the diploma. For instance, Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor, graduated from MIT, and Cognition co-founder Scott Wu graduated from Harvard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet despite these examples, a growing number of aspiring entrepreneurs fear that staying to graduate means missing the most critical window of the AI building cycle. Some, like Brendan Foody, who co-founded Mercor, have famously dropped out of prestigious schools like Georgetown to pursue their startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Kulveer Taggar, founder of the YC-focused venture firm Phosphor Capital, told TechCrunch: “There’s just this sense of urgency and maybe FOMO.” There is a calculation right now: “I can finish my degree, or I can just start building.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This fear is leading to extreme cases. One professor at an elite university recently described a student walking away from his degree in his final semester. That student was convinced that having a diploma would actually hurt his chances of getting funded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some founders fear that a diploma could be a negative signal, Yuri Sagalov, who leads General Catalyst’s seed strategy, suggests that VCs are less fixated on the dropout label, especially for students close to graduating: “I don’t think I’ve ever felt any different about someone who graduated or didn’t graduate when they’re in [their] fourth year and drop out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though self-taught tech prodigies can build startups without a formal education, Sagalov argues that there’s still value in the social network that a university creates and the brand of the university, even if the founder doesn’t receive a diploma.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">‘You get a lot of the social value… because you can put the fact that you participated,’ Sagalov said. “Most people will look you up on LinkedIn and not care as much whether you finished or not.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many investors now believe founders can forego a university degree, not all VCs agree that young founders have an edge in this market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wesley Chan, co-founder of FPV Ventures, isn’t as eager to invest in dropouts because he prioritizes a trait most young founders haven’t developed yet: wisdom. Chan believes that wisdom is typically found in “older founders or people who have a couple of scars under their belt.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Companies are also already pointing to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/cybersecurity-firm-deepwatch-lays-off-dozens-citing-move-to-accelerate-ai-investment/\">AI as the reason for layoffs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As enterprises more meaningfully adopt AI, some may take a closer look at how many employees they really need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a recent TechCrunch survey, multiple enterprise VCs said AI will have a big impact on the enterprise workforce in 2026. This was particularly interesting because the survey didn’t specifically ask about it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eric Bahn, a co-founder and general partner at Hustle Fund, expects to see affects on labor in 2026. He’s just not sure exactly what that will look like. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I want to see what roles that have been known for more repetition get automated, or even more complicated roles with more logic become more automated,” Bahn said. “Is it going to lead to more layoffs? Is there going to be higher productivity? Or will AI just be an augmentation for the existing labor market to be even more productive in the future? All of this seems pretty unanswered, but it seems like something big is going to happen in 2026.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marell Evans, founder and managing partner at Exceptional Capital, predicted companies looking to increase AI spending, will pull money from their pool for labor and hiring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think on the flip side of seeing an incremental increase in AI budgets, we’ll see more human labor get cut and layoffs will continue to aggressively impact the U.S. employment rate,” Evans said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rajeev Dham, managing director at Sapphire, agreed that 2026 budgets will start to shift resources from labor to AI. Jason Mendel, a venture investor at Battery Ventures, added that AI will start to surpass just being a tool to make existing workers more efficient in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“2026 will be the year of agents as software expands from making humans more productive to automating work itself, delivering on the human-labor displacement value proposition in some areas,” Mendel said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Antonia Dean, a partner at Black Operator Ventures, said even if companies aren’t shifting labor budgets toward AI projects, they will likely still say AI is the reason for layoffs or a reduction in labor costs anyway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces,” Dean said. “In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many AI companies argue their technology doesn’t eliminate jobs but rather helps shift workers to “deep work” or to higher-skilled jobs while AI just automates repetitive “busy work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But not everyone buys that argument, and people are worried that their jobs will be automated. According to VCs who invest in that area, it doesn’t sound like those fears will be quelled in 2026.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/02/the-biological-theory-that-explains-why-investors-are-bullish-on-fusion/\">three advances</a>: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">more power than the lasers had imparted</a> to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-commonwealth-fusion-systems\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">added $863 million to its coffers</a>, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/bill-gates-backed-commonwealth-fusion-systems-hits-key-reactor-construction-milestone/\">been hard at work</a> in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_barium_copper_oxide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">high-temperature superconducting tape</a>, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/commonwealth-fusion-systems-just-picked-its-first-commercial-site-partly-because-of-its-proximity-to-washington-d-c/\">will be built near Richmond, Virginia</a>, and Google has agreed to buy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/google-inks-its-first-fusion-power-deal-with-commonwealth-fusion-systems/\">half its output</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tae-technologies\">TAE Technologies</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 1998, <a href=\"https://tae.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TAE Technologies</a> (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2025, TAE announced that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-is-merging-with-fusion-power-company-tae-technologies-in-6b-deal/\">it would merge</a> with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fusion startup had previously raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/google-places-another-fusion-power-bet-on-tae-technologies/\">$150 million in June</a> from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-helion\">Helion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of all fusion startups, <a href=\"https://www.helionenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Helion</a> has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">raised $425 million</a> in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pacific-fusion\"><strong>Pacific Fusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.pacificfusion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pacific Fusion</a> burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/heres-how-pacific-fusion-plans-to-build-a-fusion-power-plant/\">coordinated electromagnetic pulses</a>. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-shine-technologies\"><strong>Shine Technologies</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.shinefusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shine Technologies</a> is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-general-fusion\">General Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now its third decade, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://generalfusion.com/\">General Fusion</a> has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/layoffs-hit-general-fusion-as-the-fusion-power-startup-runs-short-on-cash/\">laid off 25% of its staff</a>. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In August, they delivered somewhat, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/struggling-fusion-power-company-general-fusion-gets-22m-lifeline-from-investors/\">injecting $22 million</a> in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-general-fusion-quietly-raises-51-million-months-after-facing-cash/\">reported</a>. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tokamak-energy\">Tokamak Energy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://tokamakenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tokamak Energy</a> takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/fusion-startup-tokamak-energy-attracts-125m-for-its-egg-like-reactor-design/\">$125 million in November 2024</a> to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-zap-energy\">Zap Energy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.zapenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zap Energy</a> isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-proxima-fusion\"><strong>Proxima Fusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.proximafusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Proxima Fusion</a> is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/proxima-fusion-joins-the-club-of-well-funded-nuclear-contenders-with-e130m-series-a/\">€130 million Series A</a> that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kyoto-fusioneering\">Kyoto Fusioneering</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kyotofusioneering.com\">Kyoto Fusioneering</a> has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/03/kyoto-fusioneering-secures-11-7m-to-build-out-its-fusion-reactor-technologies/\">will need a supplier</a> for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-marvel-fusion\">Marvel Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://marvelfusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Marvel Fusion</a> follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/marvel-fusion-lands-70m-for-laser-powered-fusion-bet/?ref=ctvc.co\">fires powerful lasers</a> at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-first-light-fusion\">First Light Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike many other fusion startups, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://firstlightfusion.com\">First Light Fusion</a> doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">groundbreaking experiment in 2022</a>. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile.

We’ve watched as the tech elite <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/the-people-in-elon-musk-doge-universe/\">enmeshed themselves</a> in the U.S. government, AI companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/\">sparred</a> for dominance, and futuristic tech like smart glasses and robotaxis became <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/waymos-robotaxi-expansion-accelerates-with-3-new-cities/\">a bit more tangible</a> outside of the San Francisco bubble. You know, important stuff that’s going to impact our lives for years to come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the tech world is brimming with so many big personalities that there’s always something really dumb going on, which understandably gets overshadowed by “real news” when the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/amazon-dns-outage-breaks-much-of-the-internet/\">entire internet breaks</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-agrees-to-deal-to-cede-control-of-u-s-business-to-american-investor-group/\">TikTok gets sold</a>, or there’s a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/hacks-thefts-and-disruption-the-worst-data-breaches-of-2025/\">massive data breach</a> or something. So, as the news (hopefully) slows down for a bit, it’s time to catch up on the dumbest moments you missed – don’t worry, only one of them involves toilets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Zuckerberg, a bankruptcy lawyer from Indiana, filed a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault that his name is Mark Zuckerberg. But, like millions of other business owners, Mark Zuckerberg bought Facebook ads to promote his legal practice to potential clients. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page continually received unwarranted suspensions for impersonating Mark Zuckerberg. So, Mark Zuckerberg took legal action because he had to pay for advertisements during his suspension, even though he didn’t break any rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has been an ongoing frustration for Mark Zuckerberg, who has been practicing law since Mark Zuckerberg was three years old. Mark Zuckerberg even created a website, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://iammarkzuckerberg.com\">iammarkzuckerberg.com</a>, to explain to his potential clients that he is not Mark Zuckerberg. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I can’t use my name when making reservations or conducting business as people assume I’m a prank caller and hang up,” he wrote on his website. “My life sometimes feels like the Michael Jordan ESPN commercial, where a regular person’s name causes constant mixups.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s lawyers are probably <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/meta-wins-antitrust-trial-as-judge-denies-that-its-a-monopoly/\">very</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/federal-judge-sides-with-meta-in-lawsuit-over-training-ai-models-on-copyrighted-books/\">busy</a>, so it may take a while for Mark Zuckerberg to find out how this will shake out. But boy, oh boy, you bet I scheduled a calendar reminder for the next filing deadline in this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://public.courts.in.gov/mycase/#/vw/CaseSummary/eyJ2Ijp7IkNhc2VUb2tlbiI6IkFUejROcDI3cnFWX3RycDkzSG1rV2JXOWxoMkdfTTZFQ281aDl1b2s5WDQxIn19\">case</a> (it’s February 20, in case you’re wondering). </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all started when Mixpanel founder Suhail Doshi posted on X to warn fellow entrepreneurs about a promising engineer named Soham Parekh. Doshi had hired Parekh to work for his new company, then quickly realized he was working for several companies at once. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn’t stopped a year later. No more excuses,” Doshi <a href=\"https://x.com/Suhail/status/1940287384131969067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940287384131969067%7Ctwgr%5Eea98c78ded275c64a47ee1cd059e4fde2ab4d257%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fwho-is-soham-parekh-the-serial-moonlighter-silicon-valley-startups-cant-stop-hiring%2F\">wrote</a> on X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It turned out that Doshi wasn’t alone – he said that just that day, three founders had reached out to thank him for the warning, since they were currently employing Parekh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To some, Parekh was a morally bereft cheat, exploiting startups for quick cash. To others, he was a legend. Ethics aside, it’s really impressive to get jobs at that many companies, since tech hiring can be so competitive. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Soham Parekh needs to start an interview prep company. He’s clearly one of the greatest interviewers of all time,” Chris Bakke, who founded the job-matching platform Laskie, <a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1940555753116631302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940555753116631302%7Ctwgr%5E6c50eb17e7f4681d13983fcc3f7cf2a50f2fbaf6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Feveryone-in-tech-has-an-opinion-about-soham-parekh%2F\">wrote</a> on X. “He should publicly acknowledge that he did something bad and course correct to the thing he’s top 1% at.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parekh admitted that he was, indeed, guilty of working for multiple companies at once. But there are still some unanswered questions about his story – he claims that he was lying to all of these companies to make money, yet he regularly opted for more equity than cash in his compensation packages (equity can take years to vest, and Parekh was getting fired pretty quickly). What was really going on there? Soham, if you wanna talk, my DMs are open.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech CEOs get a lot of flack, but it’s usually not for their cooking. But when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the Financial Times (FT) for its “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1804820-c74b-4d37-b112-1df882629541\">Lunch with the FT</a>” series. Bryce Elder, an FT writer, noticed something horribly wrong in the video of Sam Altman making pasta: he was bad at olive oil. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman used olive oil from the trendy brand Graza, which sells two olive oils: Sizzle, which is for cooking, and Drizzle, which is for topping. That’s because olive oil loses its flavor when heated, so you don’t want to waste your fanciest bottle to saute something when you could put it in a salad dressing and fully appreciate it. This more flavorful olive oil is made from early harvest olives, which have a more potent flavor, but are more expensive to cultivate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Elder puts it, “His kitchen is a catalogue of inefficiency, incomprehension, and waste.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elder’s article is meant to be funny, yet he connects Altman’s haphazard cooking style with OpenAI’s excessive, unrepentant use of natural resources. I enjoyed it so much that I included it on a syllabus for a workshop I taught to high school students about bringing personality into journalistic writing. Then, I did what we in the industry (and people on tumblr) call a “reblog” and wrote about #olivegate, pointing back to the FT’s source text.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sam Altman’s fans got very mad at me! This critique of his cooking probably created more controversy than anything else I wrote this year. I’m not sure if that’s an indictment of OpenAI’s rabid supporters, or my own failure to spark debate. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you had to pick a defining tech narrative of 2025, it would probably be the evolving arms race among companies like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Anthropic, each trying to out-do one another by rushing to release increasingly sophisticated AI models. Meta has been especially aggressive in its efforts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/meta-hires-key-openai-researcher-to-work-on-ai-reasoning-models/\">poach</a> researchers from other companies, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/meta-reportedly-hires-four-more-researchers-from-openai/\">hiring</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/meta-reportedly-scores-two-more-high-profile-openai-researchers/\">several</a> OpenAI researchers this summer. Sam Altman even said that Meta was offering OpenAI employees <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/sam-altman-says-meta-tried-and-failed-to-poach-openais-talent-with-100m-offers/\">$100 million signing bonuses</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While you could argue that a $100 million signing bonus is silly, that’s not why the OpenAI-Meta staffing drama has made this list. In December, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen said on a podcast that he heard Mark Zuckerberg was hand-delivering soup to recruits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You know, some interesting stories here are Zuck actually went and hand-delivered soup to people that he was trying to recruit from us,” Chen said on Ashlee Vance’s Core Memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Chen wasn’t just going to let Zuck off the hook – after all, he tried to woo his direct reports with soup. So Chen went and gave his own soup to Meta employees. Take that, Mark. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you have any further insight into this soup drama, my Signal is @amanda.100 (this is not a joke). </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a Friday night in January, investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman posted an enticing offer on X: “Need volunteers to come to my office in Palo Alto today to construct a 5000 piece Lego set. Will provide pizza. Have to sign NDA. Please DM”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, we did our journalistic due diligence and asked Friedman if this was a serious offer. He replied, “Yes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have just as many questions now as I did in January. What was he building? Why the NDAs? Is there a secret Silicon Valley Lego cult? Was the pizza good?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">About six months later, Friedman joined Meta as the head of product at Meta Superintelligence Labs. This probably isn’t related to the Legos, but maybe Mark wooed Nat to join Meta with some soup. And like the story about the soup, I am truly begging someone who participated in this Lego build to DM me on Signal at @amanda.100. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Doing shrooms is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream with guest appearances from Grimes and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as part of your dubious quest to become immortal is, regrettably, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bryan Johnson — who made his millions in his exit from the finance startup Braintree — wants to live forever. He documents his process on social media, posting about getting <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/well/2023/07/13/blueprint-ceo-bryan-johnson-defends-plasma-donation-son-youth-aging-longevity-brainstorm-tech-fortune-utah/\">plasma transfusions</a> from his son, taking over 100 pills per day, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1752728500107378832?lang=en\">injecting Botox</a> into his genitals. So, why not test if psilocybin mushrooms can improve one’s longevity in a scientific experiment that surely needs more than one test subject to draw any sort of reasonable conclusion?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a lot about this situation that’s dumb, but I was most shocked by how boring it was. Johnson got a bit overwhelmed about hosting a livestream while tripping, which is actually very reasonable. So he spent the bulk of the event lying on a twin mattress under a weighted blanket and eye mask in a very beige room. His lineup of several guests still joined the stream and talked to one another, but Johnson did not participate much, since he was in his cocoon. Benioff talked about the Bible. Naval Ravikant called Johnson a one-man FDA. It was a normal Sunday.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078557\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryan Johnson's livestream on X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much like Bryan Johnson, Gemini is afraid to die.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For AI researchers, it’s useful to watch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/03/people-are-using-super-mario-to-benchmark-ai-now/\">how an AI model navigates games</a> like Pokémon as a benchmark. Two developers unaffiliated with Google and Anthropic set up respective Twitch streams called “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon\">Gemini Plays Pokémon</a>” and “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon\">Claude Plays Pokémon</a>,” where anyone can watch in real time as an AI tries to navigate a children’s video game from over 25 years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While neither are very good at the game, both Gemini and Claude had fascinating responses to the prospect of “dying,” which happens when all of your Pokémon faint and you get transported to the last Pokémon Center you visited. When Gemini 2.5 Pro was close to “dying,” it began to “panic.” Its “thought process” became more erratic, repeatedly stating that it needs to heal its Pokémon or use an Escape Rope to exit a cave. In a paper, Google researchers wrote that “this mode of model performance appears to correlate with a qualitatively observable degradation in the model’s reasoning capability.” I don’t want to anthropomorphize AI, but it’s a weirdly human experience to stress out about something and then perform poorly due to your anxiety. I know that feeling well, Gemini.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Claude took a nihilistic approach. When it got stuck inside of the Mt. Moon cave, the AI reasoned that the best way to exit the cave and move forward in the game would be to intentionally “die” so that it gets transported to a Pokémon Center. However, Claude did not infer that it cannot be transported to a Pokémon Center it has never visited, namely, the next Pokémon Center after Mt. Moon.

Apparently, the Dekoda can provide updates about your gut health based on these photos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A smart toilet that photographs your poop is already a punchline. But it gets worse. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are security concerns with any device related to your health, let alone one that has a camera located so close to certain body parts. Kohler assured potential customers that the camera’s sensors can only see down into the toilet, and that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption” (E2EE).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reader, the toilet was not actually end-to-end encrypted. A security researcher, Simon Fondrie-Teit, pointed out Kohler tells on itself in its own privacy policy. The company was clearly referring to TLS encryption, rather than E2EE, which may seem like a matter of semantics. But under TLS encryption, Kohler can see your poop pics, and under E2EE, the company cannot. Fondrie-Teit also pointed out that Kohler had the right to train its AI on your toilet bowl pictures, though a company representative told him that “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyway, if you notice blood in your stool, you should tell your doctor.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Bay Area firm has largely operated under the radar despite amassing roughly $4 billion in assets under management across 12 funds, including eight core fund and four “select,” opportunity-style funds that it has used to further back portfolio companies that are gaining momentum. While other VCs have grown more promotional – building personal brands on social media and podcasts to attract founders and deal flow – True has gone in the opposite direction, quietly cultivating a tight network of repeat founders. The strategy seems to be working: according to Callaghan, the firm boasts 63 exits with gains and seven IPOs amid a portfolio of some 300 companies assembled over its 20-year history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three of True’s four recent exits in the fourth quarter of 2025 involved repeat founders who came back to work with the firm again after previous successes, says Callaghan. Still, it’s Callaghan’s thinking about the future of human-computer interaction that really stands out in a sea of AI hype and mega-rounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not going to be using iPhones in 10 years,” Callaghan says flatly. “I kind of don’t think we’ll be using them in five years – or let’s say something different that’s a little safer – we’re going to be using them in very different ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His argument is simple: our phones are lousy at being the interface between humans and intelligence. “The way we take them out right now to send a text to confirm this or send you some message or write an email – [that’s] super inefficient, [and] not a great interface,” he explains. “[They’re] prone to error, prone to disruption [of] our normal lives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So sure is he of this that True has been spending years exploring alternative interfaces – software-based, hardware-based, everything in between. It’s the same instinct that led True to bet early on Fitbit before wearables were obvious, to invest in Peloton after hundreds of other VCs said ‘no thanks,’ and to back Ring when founder Jamie Siminoff kept running out of money and even the judges on “Shark Tank” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/ring-inventor-jamie-siminoff-broke-before-shark-tank-amazon-pitches/\">turned him away</a>. Each time, the bet looked questionable, says Callaghan. Each time, the bet was on a new way for humans to interact with technology that felt more natural than what came before.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest manifestation of this thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device that Callaghan describes as a “thought companion” — or, in more mundane terms, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">voice-activated ring</a> worn on the index finger. Its singular purpose: capturing and organizing your thoughts through voice notes. It’s not trying to be another Humane AI Pin or compete with Oura’s health tracking. “It does one thing really well,” Callaghan says. “But that one thing is a fundamental human behavioral need that is missing from technology today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea isn’t to passively record ambient audio but to be there when an idea strikes, or a juicy bit of gossip or fresh information makes its way to the wearer that they want to remember. It’s attached to an app, leverages AI, and, according to Callaghan, represents a very different philosophy about how we should interact with intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What drew True to Sandbar founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong wasn’t just the product, though. “When we met Mina, we were just absolutely aligned on vision,” Callaghan recalls. True’s team had met with numerous teams at work on alternative interfaces. But the approach of Fahmi and Hong – who previously worked together on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, a startup acquired by Meta in 2019 – stood out. “It’s about what [the ring] enables. It’s about the behavior it enables that we will very soon realize we can’t live without.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s an echo here of Callaghan’s old line about Peloton: “It’s not about the bike.” To some, the bike – even its earliest iteration – was compelling. But Peloton was really about the behavior it enabled and the community it created; the bike was just the vessel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This philosophy of betting on new behaviors — not just new gadgets — also explains how True has managed to stay disciplined about capital. Even as AI startups raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations out of the gate, True insists that it’s able to stick to what it does best, which is to write seed checks of $3 million to $6 million for 15% to 20% ownership in startups that it often gets to see first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Callaghan says True will raise more money to fund what’s working, but he’s not interested in raising billions of dollars. “Like, why? You don’t need that to build something amazing today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That same measured approach colors his view of the broader AI boom. While he says (when asked) that he believes OpenAI could soon be worth a trillion dollars, and while he calls this the most powerful compute wave we’ve seen, Callaghan sees warning signs in the circular financing deals backing hyperscalers and their $5 trillion in projected CapEx spending on data centers and chips. “We’re in a very capital intense part of the cycle, and that is worrisome,” he notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, he’s optimistic about where the real opportunities lie. Callaghan thinks the greatest value creation is ahead of us – not in the infrastructure layer but in the application layer, where new interfaces will enable entirely new behaviors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all comes back to his core investing philosophy, which sounds almost romantic — the kind of pitch-perfect VC wisdom that would ring hollow from most people: “It should be scary and lonely and you should be called crazy,” Callaghan says about early-stage investing done right. “And it should be really blurry and ambiguous, but you should be with a team that you really believe in.” Five to ten years later, he says, you’ll know if you were on to something.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, based on True’s track record of betting on hardware that many others missed – fitness trackers, connected bikes, smart doorbells, and now thought-capturing rings – it’s worth paying attention when Callaghan says the phone’s days are numbered. Being early is the whole point — and the trend lines support his thesis: the smartphone market is effectively saturated, growing at barely 2% annually, while wearables — smartwatches, rings, and voice-enabled devices — are expanding at double-digit rates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Something’s shifting in how we want to interact with technology, and True is placing its bets accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story originally misstated True’s assets under management (apologies).

Now, academic spinouts have consolidated into a solid startup funnel worth $398 billion — and VC money is following.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Dealroom’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dealroom.co/reports/european-spinouts-report-2025\">European Spinout Report 2025</a>, 76 of these deep tech and life sciences companies have either reached $1 billion valuations, $100 million in revenue, or both. These include unicorns like Iceye, IQM, Isar Aerospace, Synthesia, and Tekever, which are now inspiring more funds to back university spinouts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just this month, two new funds emerged that will bring more funding to talent emerging out of European tech universities, while adding breadth to a pipeline currently topped by Cambridge, Oxford, and ETH Zurich.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://psv.xyz/\">PSV Hafnium</a>, out of Denmark, recently closed its inaugural fund at an oversubscribed €60 million (approximately $71 million), with a focus on Nordic deep tech. With offices in Berlin and London, but also in Aachen, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://u2v.vc/\">U2V</a> (University2Ventures) is targeting the same amount for its first fund, of which it recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2025/12/earlybird-x-spin-off-u2v-launches-e60-million-fund-back-deeptech-startups-from-european-tech-universities/\">completed the first closing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These two newcomers join the growing ranks of European venture firms that have university spinouts as a core part of their investment thesis. Pioneered by the likes of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/11/cambridge-innovation-capital/\">Cambridge Innovation Capital</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/14/oxford-sciences-innovation-fund/\">Oxford Science Enterprises</a>, which have now fully matured, this category has also diversified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it still mostly consists of funds backed by one or several universities and institutes, it now includes independent firms that simply see spinouts as potential fund returners — and rightly so. Oxford Ionics, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/university-oxfords-highest-value-quantum-computing-spinout-acquisition\">acquired by U.S.-based IonQ</a>, was one of the six spinouts out of Switzerland, the U.K., and Germany that delivered exits of more than $1 billion to their investors in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These exits come alongside increased amounts of funding. According to Dealroom, European university spinouts in deep tech and life sciences are on track to raise a near all-time-high $9.1 billion in 2025. This contrasts with overall VC funding in Europe, which is down nearly 50% from its 2021 peak. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large rounds closed in 2025 also reflect appetite for spinouts in sectors as varied as nuclear energy — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/proxima-fusion-joins-the-club-of-well-funded-nuclear-contenders-with-e130m-series-a/\">Proxima Fusion</a> — and dual-use drones — Quantum Systems, now <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://quantum-systems.com/news/quantum-systems-triples-valuation/\">valued above $3 billion</a>. In many cases, these startups leverage research from specialized labs, which also explains why there is a long tail of European locations capable of producing spinouts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building relationships with hubs outside of Oxbridge and leading countries can also be a way for newcomers to differentiate themselves and find deals. “The Nordic’s research institutions hold extraordinary, untapped potential,” PSV Hafnium’s partners stated in a press release. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PSV Hafnium itself is a spinout from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), but is also making early-stage investments in other Nordic countries. One of its nine checks to date went to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sisusemi.com/\">SisuSemi</a>, a Finnish startup leveraging a decade of research at the University of Turku to bring new surface cleaning tech to the semiconductor industry. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is good news for teams like SisuSemi that there is more funding available to them. It also comes in addition to grants, commercialization support, and improved <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/09/from-spinouts-to-fundraising-to-ma-founders-need-transparent-deal-terms/\">deal terms</a> that contribute to an encouraging environment for Europe’s spinouts. However, one pain point remains: growth capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the report’s authors note, this gap “is not a unique trend to spinouts, but something impacting the entire startup ecosystem in Europe.” Still, it is quite striking that nearly 50% of late-stage funding for European deep tech and life sciences spinouts comes from outside Europe, mainly from the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this share has decreased over the years, Europe won’t be fully reaping the benefits of its investments in talent and research unless this changes more substantially — but that’s a broader issue to be solved.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Instead of tanking, venture bets in the sector remained essentially flat relative to 2024, <a href=\"https://www.ctvc.co/your-2025-predictions-the-results-are-in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to CTVC, far from the slide some had expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That resiliency is due in part to continued threat of climate change. Perhaps a bigger contributing factor is that many climate technologies have become either cheaper or better than the fossil fuel alternatives — or are on the cusp of being so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The incredible cost reductions of solar, wind, and batteries continue to fill climate tech’s sails. Not every new technology will follow the same path.

It’s not entirely surprising — for the climate tech world, cheap, clean energy is its cornerstone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interest in data centers has only increased in the last year.

But <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisabcoca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lisa Coca</a>, partner at <a href=\"https://toyota.ventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Toyota Ventures</a>, thinks they’ll adjust their focus for 2026. “The 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid,” she said. Decoupling could solve some challenges that data centers face, namely in resistance from grid operators and the public, who are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increasingly worried</a> that the new loads are driving up their electricity prices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefited from the boom. “Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgoldman1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Daniel Goldman</a>, managing partner at <a href=\"https://cleanenergyventures.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Clean Energy Ventures</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-teamey-9a53197/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kyle Teamey</a>, managing partner at <a href=\"https://www.racap.com/planetary-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">RA Capital Planetary Health</a>. But it’s not likely to affect infrastructure plans, he added. “The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewbeebe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Andrew Beebe</a>, managing director at <a href=\"https://obvious.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Obvious Ventures</a>, thinks the data center bubble might burst in 2026 or early 2027, but that no such bubble exists in electricity generation. “We still need a LOT more power, and we’ll use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of AI and data centers, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilachyuta/\">Anil </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilachyuta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Achyuta</a>, partner at <a href=\"https://www.energyimpactpartners.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Energy Impact Partners</a>, said reindustrialization will take more of the spotlight this year. “We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets,” he said, citing robotics, batteries, and power electronics as examples.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-continuing-quest-for-power\">The continuing quest for power</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thanks to the drumbeat of new data center announcements, energy-related startups have gotten a boost this past year, perhaps none more than those working on nuclear fission. In <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/microreactor-startup-antares-raises-96m-for-land-sea-and-space-based-nuclear-power/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/x-energy-rides-nuclear-wave-raises-700m-series-d/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/nuclear-startup-last-energy-raises-100m-for-its-steel-encased-micro-reactor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">few</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/radiant-nuclear-raises-300m-for-its-semi-sized-1-mw-reactor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">weeks</a>, nuclear startups have announced rounds totaling over $1 billion, leading to speculation that many will SPAC or go public through a traditional IPO in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nuclear everything is in vogue right now,” Teamey said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it will take a while for nuclear power to make a dent in electricity demand. In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/data-centers-love-solar-heres-a-comprehensive-guide-to-deals-over-100-megawatts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">solar</a> and batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/energy-storage-industry-set-aggressive-goals-for-2025-and-already-crushed-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">record-setting deployments</a> in 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.” said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leobanchik/\">Leo Banchik</a>, director at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.voyagervc.com\">Voyager</a>. “One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that’s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation,” said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/posamentier/\">Joshua </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/posamentier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Posamentier</a>, managing partner at <a href=\"https://www.congruentvc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Congruent Ventures</a>. “Natural gas assets are growing pretty linearly. There’s not much new capacity in turbine manufacturing coming online, and they’re selling everything they can. Geothermal will go geometric.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauriemenoud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Laurie Menoud</a>, founding partner at <a href=\"https://www.atoneventures.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">At One Ventures</a>. “Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-startup-is-most-likely-to-go-public-in-2026\">Which startup is most likely to go public in 2026?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-invests-in-fervos-462m-round-to-unlock-even-more-geothermal-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recently raised a $462 million round</a>. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-trends-to-watch\">Trends to watch</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-duffuor-7b1a6224/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amy Duffuor</a>, general partner at <a href=\"https://azollaventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Azolla Ventures</a>. “The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid’s reliability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. “One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI, of course, is likely to play a role in climate tech’s transformation. “We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattrogers2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Matt Rogers</a>, founder at <a href=\"https://www.incite.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Incite</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mill.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mill</a>. “Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. “When investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out, that’s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,” he said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dive-deeper\">Dive deeper</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below are the detailed comments from the investors who replied to TechCrunch’s survey, listed in alphabetical order.

What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reindustrialization beyond data centers will be a major theme. We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets. For example, supporting next-generation robotics to address labor shortages and national security concerns will require integrated supply chains. Batteries, power electronics, fuel cells, gas turbines, and even home building are examples of end markets/technologies where parts of the value chain will need to be reindustrialized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another area to watch is AI-driven physical science. While companies like Zanskar (predictive AI for geothermal) and Fabric8Labs (generative cooling for data centers) have shown promise, we haven’t seen many visible breakthroughs yet. That said, the talent pool working on these problems is impressive and could lead to exciting developments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers. Beyond that, batteries — particularly sodium-ion — represent one of the most economical and near-term solutions at the grid-scale. I am bullish about the progress in this technology, and pairing solar with batteries (as companies like Peak Energy are doing) continues to be a highly attractive approach. Next-gen geothermal is also showing a good amount of promise but the timelines are like that of nuclear, potent but will take about a decade to bring full capacity online.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, algorithmic solutions to unlock new power using existing infrastructure (e.g., Gridcare, ThinkLabs AI) and optimize workloads (e.g., Emerald AI) can further enhance grid efficiency. There are also other innovations worth noting in bringing more power, such as applying optical coating to transmission lines to reduce losses being advanced by AssetCool (an EIP portfolio company).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fervo Energy, Commonwealth Fusion, Redwood Materials would be my personal guesses, but I could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sodium-ion batteries for grid-scale storage are already being deployed and will accelerate significantly in 2026. Another technology to watch is solid-state transformers (note Heron Power is an EIP portfolio company). The industry is advancing faster than expected and scale similarly to semiconductors, though at-scale production might take longer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One emerging trend is the underground build-out of transmission lines. Advances in robotics could enable a rapid, cost-effective approach that significantly reduces wildfire risk and, in turn, mitigates the substantial carbon emissions associated with such events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Distributed power, heat, and computation are the last class of trends we are curiously tracking for 2026.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-leo-banchik-director-at-voyager\">Leo Banchik, director at Voyager</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers will keep driving record power demand as AI workloads scale. Despite talk of overbuild, we’re unlikely to see much stranded capacity — as compute gets cheaper and more available, we’ll keep finding new uses for it. The interesting shift is hyperscalers differentiating between clean power sources — firm vs. intermittent, location, and additionality — rather than just headline megawatt-hours. This is already playing out in bespoke offtake deals and on-site supply strategies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fission and geothermal should see continued momentum from both private capital and federal support. Fusion will likely attract increased federal support as geopolitical competition intensifies, though we’re still many years away from high-capacity-factor grid-scale deployment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natural gas peaker alternatives will gain traction too — using new turbines and modular designs with integrated carbon capture as grids manage new peak demands from AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solar and battery build-out will continue given their strong economics. For dispatchable, 24/7 baseload power, we’ll see growth in fission, geothermal, and peaker alternatives like modular gas turbines with integrated carbon capture. There’s also a grid-edge opportunity worth watching: large facilities procuring dedicated baseload on-site rather than adding to grid congestion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most likely fission or geothermal. These companies have raised substantial capital and built strong offtake agreements with hyperscalers and utilities. With multibillion-dollar project pipelines and the need for continued growth financing, several could pursue public markets in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Energy storage deployment is accelerating across residential, commercial, industrial (including data center backup), and grid-scale applications. Domestic supply chains, including second-life battery systems, are gaining traction for stationary storage. We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on chemistry and business models. One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Industrial heat pumps and thermal storage systems for steam and process heat are becoming cheaper to operate than gas boilers in many regions and applications, especially where waste heat is available and electricity prices are favorable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ll also see more growth in critical minerals and battery materials projects — lithium, rare earth, magnesium refining; battery component and cell manufacturing; copper recycling — maturing with federal support as supply chain security becomes a strategic priority.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Software and AI enabling physical infrastructure: real-time factory intelligence that improves energy efficiency and manufacturing yields, AI-based design tools that speed up product development cycles, grid management software that orchestrates intermittent renewables with storage and dispatchable power.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies taking a clean-sheet approach to reimagining foundational technologies — a SpaceX-style rethink of components once considered solved problems. Motor designs that eliminate rare earth dependencies, grid infrastructure like transformers with modern manufacturing techniques, advanced materials processing that significantly reduces costs while improving quality. Improvements in robotics help to enable these cost curves, making U.S. manufacturing economically viable where it wasn’t before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains. Defense and industrial policy are backing these not for climate reasons, but because they deliver cost advantages and supply security.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-andrew-beebe-managing-director-at-obvious-ventures\">Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers will again dominate. But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation). We will live with the dual reality of too much money/debt spent on data centers, and the speculation bubble will likely burst (maybe early 2027). But at the same time, we’ll still need a LOT more power, and will use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For power generation: geothermal in the near-term. Fission in the mid-term. Fusion in the 10-year-plus long-term. For actual siting: The above technologies can be sited anywhere, but mainly western states for geothermal. For batteries — PJM [the grid that covers the mid-Atlantic west to parts of Illinois] and Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venture-backed: Fervo</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geothermal and grid-scale batteries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grid software and EV trucking.

What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates. To some extent this is from “picks and shovels” companies who don’t want to get commoditized so they’re strategizing how to be a bigger player/more integrated rather than just a component that’s purchased. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A related phrase I hear more frequently is power density and/or specific power (power to weight), as a load of corporates are anticipating or planning how their energy divisions branch into robotics. Duncan Turner here is our expert. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I don’t have a climate tech company in my portfolio going public in 2026. Tidal Vision is targeting 2027. That’s my closest. I don’t want to opine on other VC’s portfolio companies, even though I have my feelings, because I shouldn’t open my mouth where I’m only partially informed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For larger scales in 2026, my fastest scaling companies are Tidal Vision and Voyage Foods, which has taken over a General Motors plant in Ohio. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On what to pay more attention to, I’ll toot Duncan’s horn here again — what he’s doing with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/sosv-bets-plasma-will-change-everything-from-semiconductors-to-spacecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Plasma Forge</a> is IMHO going to be super compelling and make everyone study at night. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One last note is my consistent feeling that it’s when investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out that the real breakthroughs finally happen. I learned this lesson back in 1999 when we were all wondering if the search space was going to be won by Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I do feel like that’s happening in my personal portfolio. I said this <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/po-bronson-on-surviving-the-agrifoodtech-venture-downturn-non-rigorous-thinking-and-weapons-of-mass-dilution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to AgFunder recently</a>, but when the VC world asks about winning sectors, there’s a presumption that the sector will be so hot that there will be multiple winners. Most markets don’t have multiple winners, and the sector doesn’t win; just one company wins. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tom-chi-founding-partner-at-at-one-ventures\">Tom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There will be a lot more around data centers in 2026. They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Budgets for hyperscalers are in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, which encompasses power, chips, and much more. The chips are expensive enough that folks are willing to pay a bit more to get power on the grid sooner as the losses from chip depreciation are greater than most things you could incrementally add to your power scale-up budget.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IPO market still a bit murky, and most folks don’t telegraph exactly when they will go public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Folks like Fervo are at an interesting inflection point. One of our portcos Provectus Algae is also at an interesting point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve had a pretty big pendulum swing away from the more capital-intensive work in industrial decarbonization that aren’t in AI. They are still critical for our collective future, even if out of fashion for a few years.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lisa-coca-partner-at-toyota-ventures\">Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In our view at Toyota Ventures, the 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We believe that the biggest investment opportunities are in firm, dispatchable, and scalable carbon-free energy. We have actively invested in technologies that support increasing baseload power, both geothermal and nuclear, through portfolio companies such as Rodatherm and Natura Resources. For critical grid flexibility, we are backing advanced, long-duration energy storage battery technologies with an investment in e-Zinc. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We anticipate that nuclear power will continue to lead the way in terms of IPOs and SPACs in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Challenging question since we believe it is more a function of how, and if, the capital stack continues to evolve. There is a healthy number of climate tech companies across multiple sectors that are on the cusp of deploying at a larger scale. The biggest hurdle is securing FOAK financing to de-risk the all-important step of advancing from first of a kind to nth of a kind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Our team expects resiliency and adaptation will continue to reign strong in 2026. The Toyota Ventures portfolio illustrates this: BurnBot addresses wildfire mitigation, ZymoChem bolsters supply chain resilience with sustainable materials, and Alora creates adaptable resource solutions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-amy-duffuor-general-partner-at-azolla-ventures\">Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My prediction is that the energy conversation shifts from generation of power to how fast power can actually be delivered. Interconnection timelines, permitting, and physical grid constraints continue to be a bottleneck and data centers will increasingly rely on hybrid strategies that blend grid power, storage, and demand flexibility to hit timelines.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One opportunity is at grid-ready sites, like places with existing transmission and substation. Anything that shortens interconnection timelines creates outsized value right now because access to the grid is scarce. Also interested in wireless transmission of power even though it’s in the early stages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There has been a lot of talk about Fervo Energy…!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long-duration energy storage technology companies, which will move from initial pilots to demos to repeatable deployments. We’re particularly excited about our portfolio company Noon Energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category. The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-daniel-goldman-managing-partner-at-clean-energy-ventures\">Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We expect to see an acceleration of deal making in the data center/hyperscaler space consisting of the following: </p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Structured power off take agreements with a mix of behind-the-meter and utility-related infrastructure to bring optimization around pricing and reliability;</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">More action at the federal, ISO/RTO, and state level to accelerate deployment of energy assets while balancing tariff structures that avoid burdening voting consumers with increased costs;</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">M&amp;A in the technology optimization area, including resources such as geothermal, nuclear, critical minerals and downstream hardware and software products enabling the digitalization, decarbonization and distribution of energy supplies and load management, a key area of our focus and that which venture capital in general is quite focused on. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While we don’t expect an overall “bust cycle” for data center and hyperscaler development activities, we do expect some rationalization of development and implementation of efficiency options to reduce capacity needs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The greatest near-term opportunity — and challenge — lies in improving the grid itself. Grid modernization through digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization will unlock cost savings, optimize existing infrastructure, and better integrate significant distributed energy resources — probably not saying anything new here. Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We expect this trend to continue despite recent policy shifts in the IRA and there are hundreds of venture capital-backed companies that can have a material impact on the grid as they scale-up and see more adoption rates in the market. Disruption is here!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Factorial appears to be a leading candidate following its plans to de-SPAC in 2026. Its trajectory illustrates that companies with strong customer traction in large markets, clear cost and performance advantages, and rapidly scaling revenues are well-positioned for the public markets. (This SPAC market contrasts with the 2020 one where entrants such as QuantumScape did not have meaningful revenues and perhaps were ill-prepared for public markets.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Watch out for more companies hitting public markets on hype, instead of good fundamentals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond Factorial, several companies in energy storage, generation, and critical minerals are approaching scalable revenue levels to access low-cost of capital public markets (a real benefit), though in the minerals sector we may see growth in mergers and acquisitions precede any public offerings in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Projects in energy storage, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), critical minerals, and material manufacturing facilities across the energy supply chain will see significant investment in the U.S., with manufacturing tax credits and attractive market opportunities still available notwithstanding federal policy headwinds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, we extensively evaluated and developed new risk transfer solutions for FOAK project developers. We see commercial lenders and private credit starting to lean more heavily into this space with the support of insurance underwriting and catalytic capital. We expect to see more projects and more debt financing  for early commercialization, which up until this point has only trickled in. This is the key enabler of the greater scale we need across the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For western markets to compete with China’s manufacturing and increasingly innovation prowess, financial innovation is CRITICAL. Global markets need to deploy $3 trillion to $9 trillion per year through 2050 on climate related technologies and implementation of projects if we hope to reduce global temperatures and compete in these markets internationally. Global spending on climate related investment was only $2 trillion in 2024 and is on a path for a similar amount in 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To increase the rate of deployment, we must convince public and private investors that the risk-return balance is favorable to deploy capital across the climate capital stack — early-stage venture, growth-stage venture, private equity, commercial lending and private credit, and infrastructure. Our sector is not attracting enough capital; in simple terms, risks need to decline or returns need to increase. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We see opportunities to use risk-sharing mechanisms to optimize capital stacks and lower the cost of capital for new technology projects, which also brings them down the cost curve faster. Promising solutions include technology and performance risk insurance, surety bonds for managing construction risks, pooling off-take agreements among buyer groups (e.g., hyperscalers for clean power or airlines for SAF), filling gaps in construction financing, and more. Clean Energy Ventures’ spent time during 2025 identifying new risk transfer solutions working closely with our counterparts in the finance and insurance sectors. We believe 2026 will see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We should also be paying very close attention to cost curves. The impact of AI is showing up but not being widely reported in climate tech. Inside large companies and small startups the benefits of AI are driving costs down, allowing faster innovation at complex facilities and in supply chains. This is apparent in chemicals, mining and refining, power generation and grid optimization, manufacturing (steel, cement), recycling and waste management, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are only at the embryonic stage of seeing the impact of AI on the cost curves in a wide range of commodities and industries. As we talk about the upward impact on power prices driven by AI infrastructure requirements, we need to keep in mind that AI will also radically transform industries globally and reduce cost of production.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-laurie-menoud-at-one-ventures\">Laurie Menoud, At One Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling. But from a VC perspective, building and scaling data centers isn’t a startup timeline. It’s a decade-long struggle of permits, substations, and grid upgrades. To put numbers on it, hyperscale data centers take 3 to 6 years to permit and connect in the US today. In some markets, interconnection alone can exceed 5 to 7 years. So in 2026, I expect to see continued traction for energy companies that are not only tied to data centers but can expand into commercial and industrial use cases and front-of-the-meter applications. Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Related to this is the supply of critical metals, which I continue to be very focused on: mining, extraction, refining, and recycling. This is critical not only for data centers (especially copper), but also for EV batteries with lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In places where thermal (coal and gas) and nuclear plants are being retired, because those sites already have high-capacity grid connections. That makes deploying new clean generation dramatically faster. In the U.S. alone, more than 60 GW of coal capacity has retired since 2015, and another 40+ GW is scheduled to retire by 2030. Each retirement frees up a transmission node that took decades to build. Reusing that interconnection is often the difference between a 2-year vs. an 8-year project timeline. And that’s where you could install next-gen nuclear reactors, like Stellaria, that cut long-lived waste, capex, opex, deployment time, and extends fuel use, or geothermal energy like Factor2 Energy, utilizing underground CO2 reservoirs for lower constraints on deployment location. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same is true of industrial sites (chemicals, steel, refineries) that already have oversized grid connections. These sites are trying to expand production, and add storage, and they already have one of the hardest problems solved: interconnection. If you want to electrify heavy industry quickly, you go where the grid already exists. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No one can really know, but the battery recycling and circular critical materials subsector is one I’d watch closely. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt prices are extremely sensitive to geopolitics, and recycling provides a lower-risk, domestic supply for the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relectrify is deploying their battery systems at commercial production scale in 2026 with a cumulative capacity of 100 MWh. They use cell-level semiconductor circuitry to individually control battery cells at high frequency, directly producing an alternating current waveform. No need for an inverter anymore, which is a direct win on CAPEX, improved usable lifetime battery capacity, and lower OPEX by identifying and replacing malfunctioning cells with precision. It’s happening now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And overall, grid-scale energy storage beyond lithium, driven by both AI data centers and renewable growth. Without it, you simply can’t run 24/7 clean power outside of nuclear and hydro. Globally, stationary storage is projected to grow from ~45 GWh in 2023 to hundreds of GWs by 2030. Some of the new technologies are already ready today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Battery recycling and closed-loop supply chains with automakers (recycled lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper going back into new batteries) are also already scaling. 2026 is about acceleration. Ascend Elements has already built the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facility in North America, and has now achieved the first production of recycled lithium carbonate. Imports make up the majority of the US supply of lithium carbonate today, mostly from Argentina and Chile. If you can secure your metal supply with lower-cost recycled content, isn’t that a big win?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like Chemfinity, that could make domestic metal refining at cost parity with China, and anything tied to mining, extraction, refining, and recycling of critical metals for data centers and EVs. Copper is THE metal for data centers. It’s used in power cables, busbars, transformers, cooling loops. A single gigawatt of data-center capacity requires on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. And about 40% – 45% of the world’s copper refining is in China, followed by Chile. It’s the same geographical structure as lithium refining and battery precursor chemistry. People talk about energy security. This is what it actually looks like. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-joshua-posamentier-managing-partner-at-congruent-ventures\">Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Push for growth will continue but attention will shift from flashy gigawatt announcements to construction, commissioning, and dealing with the brutal realities of interconnect and permitting delays. The result will be a huge upwelling of “bring your own generation” and “demand flexibility.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The age of ASSPs/ASICs will begin in earnest for AI data centers. GPUs will continue to grow, but the rate will taper in favor of more specialist chips that are far more efficient, especially for inference loads. This will start decoupling data center power consumption from token generation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The unit economics of the marquee foundational AI shops will leak. They will not look good. But they will convince investors to support them through their trough of upside down unit economics until they achieve positive unit economics, which will come sooner than expected. But the shine will be off: These will fall into a different bucket than high margin SaaS companies from prior bubbles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers will become far better grid participants through flexibility, load shaping, and power quality, and they will be rewarded with far faster interconnect times than other big loads — the more tech they adopt, the faster they’ll get connected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ll see the first off-grid world-scale data center NTP [notice to proceed, or a letter telling a contractor to begin work]. We’ll also see more NIMBY pushback on proximate data centers because of everything from power costs to size to water use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nuclear fusion! I think we’ll see the first net gain by analysis (i.e., deuterium fusion where it would be Q&gt;1 if it were tritium) in a startup reactor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heels in terms of new generation with linearly deploying gas assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SPAC or IPO? Lots in the pipe, pun intended.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geothermal for electricity and district heating. Friction is still way too high for single site geothermal heat loops to scale much faster than today. Thermal energy storage (load shifting) for industrial applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robotics (not the humanoid kind) are taking over a huge number of labor-intensive industries; they will impact many industrial, agriculture, waste, and manufacturing operations in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Logistics and manufacturing efficiency: electrification, efficiency, onshoring, and AI are pushing on emissions from half of the economy and these sectors are economic, not impact buyers. Give them long-term certainty on lower costs vs. conventional fuels, for example, and you’ll have buyers. This is everything from electrified autonomous trucking to electric autonomous rail and dark terminals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resilience technology is going to really get going. Insurance costs (due to climate risk) are outpacing every other cost for homeowners and impacting commercial operations. Businesses and individuals are going to aggressively begin to invest in resilience in the face of accelerating climate change and extreme weather but also aging infrastructure and a shift from centralized to distributed resource paradigms.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-matt-rogers-founder-at-incite-and-mill\">Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers will serve as factories for the next phase of AI innovation powering America’s society and economy. I think local governments will step up more in 2026 and challenge hyperscalers to deliver solutions that are more in line with community needs and municipal partnership that allows for swifter construction. Energy affordability is top of mind, and we really need to reverse the trend of 2025 of rising costs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The call is coming from inside the house in 2026. In other words, consumers have more impact than anyone thinks. Decentralized infrastructure solutions, including rooftop solar, energy storage, and distributed energy resources, like heat pumps and smart thermostats, are available today. Households can turn them on swiftly, cost-effectively, and without the major disruptions to grids across the nation we are seeing today. It’s faster to permit than building new centralized power plants. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If enough people adopt these approachable solutions, America’s grid has a better shot at handling the increased capacity from the data center AI boom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also an alignment opportunity hiding in plain sight: AI pioneers and Big Tech companies want a faster, more predictable path to build. Local and state governments want affordability, economic investment, and resilience. Communities are actually in a unique position to trade swift permitting and flexible construction timelines for economic rejuvenation, tax revenue, and job creation from the private sector. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By enabling more efficient households with lower utility bills, hyperscalers can access the energy they need to operate AI data centers. Much faster. That’s why this isn’t a moonshot. The opposite, in fact. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mill. We’ll deploy more Food Recyclers, and on a different scale, than ever before. We’re planning more partnerships to encourage more households, businesses, and communities to view food as something to return back to the food system rather than leave for weeks in dumpsters and then years in landfills.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robotics is going to attract massive funding and private sector attention in 2026. Simultaneously, builders will move away from the hype around humanoid models towards functional robots designed to handle specific tasks and make life easier. The future of robotics will look more like Roomba than your neighbor Rhonda, which actually bodes well from both an affordability and technology risk perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers. Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems. In order for AI to power the future without tanking grids or negatively impacting communities, it must be paired with physical hardware that solves problems and makes everyday life better for people. We’ll benefit as much from an AI smartphone as we will with an AI-powered waste facility.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kyle-teamey-managing-partner-at-ra-capital-planetary-health\">Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think data centers will still dominate in 2026. But I guess I’m a little jaded on this stuff because I was in the last AI cycle — it’s a lot of the same conversation. But the level of investment is orders of magnitude greater. The level of attention is orders of magnitude greater. And so it’s going to take a long while for this to shake out one way or another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station. Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure. But that would take a while to be manifested. It’s going to take months to a year perhaps to to really be manifested. You’d have to shut it off midstream and try to claw your money back. That’s pretty hard to do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has been talked about a lot, but the data use, the requirements for data, it scales fairly exponentially. Power it scales quite linearly. As a consequence, it’s going to take a long while, I think, for the physical world to catch up to the data demand side. It’s really all of the above. If you can if you can do anything in power generation, power storage, transmission, distribution, if you can improve grid operations — the list goes on and on and on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A bull market in electricity like this, I don’t know how long it’s been, maybe like a century? And so it really, at least to us, it looks like it’s all of the above. Lots and lots of interesting opportunities within that. We’ve seen some companies go public in the like the last 12, 18 months. We probably will see more. I think it’s fair to to think that there will be. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think power generation is gonna see more public companies in 2026, for sure. There could be a wide, wide variety there. Nuclear everything is in vogue right now. We’ll likely see more of those. Geothermal, we’ll definitely see some of those. And you’ve already got a bunch of interesting players who are in project development and implementation, some of those could go public as well. It’s not just the tech companies, but the folks up and down the value chain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nuclear fission companies in particular. That could be a bubble for sure, but if some of these companies start succeeding and start getting uh projects built. Every few years these opportunities pop up, and it makes sense that people take advantage of those opportunities to raise some additional cash and grow more rapidly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There haven’t been any technologies I’ve seen recently where I’m like, ‘Oh wow that’s going to change the world, everyone should be looking at that.’ I do think it is more about scaling for a lot of these right now. If you can hit scale quickly, it’s an amazing opportunity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you look at the the various trends, it’s not just the manufacturing demand. The other driver is the regionalization of everything, which is driving demand for labor, for resources. Fill in the blank, there’s demand for it. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Dictation apps have been around for years, but in the past they’ve proved slow and inaccurate — unless you speak with particular accents and enunciate clearly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But advances in large language models (LLMs) and speech-to-text models have helped improve the systems that can decipher speech better while retaining the context to format the text. And developers have built in features to automatically format text, remove filler words, and ignore fumbles to output text that would need fewer edits. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with the soaring popularity of everything AI, there’s dozens of such apps on the market. So we’ve collated our pick of the best and most useful dictation apps his year.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wispr-flow\">Wispr Flow</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wisprflow.ai/pricing\">Wispr Flow</a> is a well-funded AI dictation app that lets you add custom words and instructions for dictation. It has native apps for macOS, Windows, and iOS, and an Android version is in the works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app lets you customize how its system transcribes your notes by letting you choose from “formal,” “casual,” and “very casual” styles for different kinds of writing, such as personal messaging, work, and email. And if you use it with vibe-coding tools like Cursor, you can turn on a feature to automatically recognize variables or tag files in the chat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app lets you note up to 2,000 words per month for free on any of the desktop versions, and 1,000 words per month on iOS. Its subscription plans offer unlimited transcription and start at $15 per month.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3021576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg 4800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wispr-Flow-lead.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Wispr Flow</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-willow\">Willow</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://willowvoice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Willow</a> advertises itself as a big time-saver for those who don’t like to type. Alongside common features like automatic editing and formatting, the app has a feature that taps large language models to generate a full chunk of text from just a few dictated words.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Willow also takes a more privacy-focused stab at AI-assisted note-taking by storing all transcripts locally on your device, and lets you opt out of model training as well. It also lets you add custom vocabulary to the app to help it adapt to your industry’s parlance, or your local dialect. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3066903\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg 2664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=768,515 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=680,456 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=1200,804 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=1280,858 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=430,288 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=720,482 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=900,603 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=800,536 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=1536,1029 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1372 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=668,448 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=560,375 560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=921,617 921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=708,474 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3_2-2.jpeg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Willow</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Willow lets you dictate 2,000 words per month on its desktop app for free.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprises have been piloting and testing different AI tools for the past few years to figure out what their adoption strategy will look like. Investors think that period of experimentation is coming to an end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch recently surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs and an overwhelming majority predicted enterprises will increase their budgets for AI in 2026 — but not for everything. Most investors said this budget increase will be concentrated and that many enterprises will spend more funds on fewer contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Ferguson, a vice president at Databricks Ventures, predicted 2026 will be the year that enterprises start consolidating their investments and picking winners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today, enterprises are testing multiple tools for a single-use case, and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts],” Ferguson said. “As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools and deploy that savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rob Biederman, a managing partner at Asymmetric Capital Partners, agreed. He predicts that enterprise companies will not only concentrate their individual spending, but also the broader enterprise landscape will narrow its overall AI spending to only a handful of vendors across the entire industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else,” Biederman said. “We expect a bifurcation where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focused-investments\">Focused investments</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scott Beechuk, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners, thinks enterprises will increase their spending on the tools that make AI safe for enterprises to use.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Enterprises now recognize that the real investment lies in the safeguards and oversight layers that make AI dependable,” Beechuk said. “As these capabilities mature and reduce risk, organizations will feel confident shifting from pilots to scaled deployments, and budgets will increase.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harsha Kapre, a director at Snowflake Ventures, predicted enterprises will spend on AI in three distinct areas in 2026: strengthening data foundations, model post-training optimization, and consolidation of tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Chief investment officers] are actively reducing [software-as-a-service] sprawl and moving toward unified, intelligent systems that lower integration costs and deliver measurable [return on investment],” Kapre said. “AI-enabled solutions are likely going to see the biggest benefit from this shift.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A shift away from experimentation and toward concentration will affect startups. What’s not clear, is how.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s possible that AI startups will reach the same reckoning point that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/2024-startups-bounce-back-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SaaS startups</a> arrived at a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies operating hard-to-replicate products such as vertical solutions or those built on proprietary data will likely still be able to grow. Startups with products similar to those offered by large enterprise suppliers, like AWS or Salesforce, may start to see pilot projects and funding dry up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors see this possibility too. When asked how they know that an AI startup has a moat, multiple VCs said companies with proprietary data and products that can’t easily be replicated by a tech giant or large language model company are the most defensible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If investor predictions are true and enterprises do start to concentrate their AI spend next year, 2026 could be the year enterprise budgets increase but many AI startups don’t see a bigger slice of the pie.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, a U.S. judge temporarily <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/trump-tiktok-decision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocked</a> Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration.

Manus claimed at the time that it outperformed OpenAI’s Deep Research.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In April, just weeks after launch, venture capital firm Benchmark led a $75 million funding round that assigned Manus a post-money valuation of $500 million and saw Benchmark general partner Chetan Puttagunta joining the startup’s board. Per Chinese <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/articles/chinese-ai-agent-manus-transcends-093000431.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">media outlets</a>, some other big-name backers had already invested in Manus at that point, including Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly known as Sequoia China) via a $10 million round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://manus.im/blog/manus-100m-arr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> in mid-December that it has since signed up millions of users and is generating annual recurring revenue of more than $100 million from monthly and yearly subscribers to its membership service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was around this time that Meta started negotiating with Manus, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-buys-ai-startup-manus-adding-millions-of-paying-users-f1dc7ef8?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the WSJ</a>, which says the tech giant is paying $2 billion — the valuation Manus was reportedly seeking for its next funding round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Zuckerberg, who has staked Meta’s future on AI, Manus represents something new: an AI product that’s actually making money. This is especially pertinent given that investors have grown increasingly twitchy about Meta’s $60 billion infrastructure spending spree, and the broader tech industry’s debt-backed expenditures on data center construction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it’ll keep Manus running independently and weave the startup’s AI agents into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, where Meta’s own chatbot, Meta AI, is already available to users.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is one wrinkle, however: Manus’ Chinese founders founded its parent company, Butterfly Effect, in Beijing in 2022, before decamping to Singapore in the middle of this year. Whether that raises flags in Washington remains to be seen, but Senator John Cornyn has already dragged Benchmark for its investment in the company, <a href=\"https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/1920131642389065856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raising</a> concerns back in May about American capital going to a Chinese concern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has long been one of Congress’ most vocal hawks on China and technology competition, but he’s hardly alone. Being tough on China has become one of the few genuinely bipartisan issues in Congress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, Meta has already <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-says-ai-startup-manus-to-cut-china-ties-after-acquisition?utm_social_post_id=637317589&amp;utm_social_handle_id=3335963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Nikkei Asia</a> that after the acquisition, Manus won’t have any ties to Chinese investors and will no longer operate in China. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson told the outlet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
