If you received an Apple gift card over the holidays and are exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047856\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png 3280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1280,574 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=2048,919 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1375,617 1375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need. </p>\n\n<p

Dutch entrepreneur <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nalden.net\">Nalden</a>, who co-founded the platform in 2009, says he’s deeply unhappy with changes made since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bending-spoons-acquires-file-transfer-service-wetransfer/\">Bending Spoons</a> — a Milan-based tech firm known for buying and restructuring popular apps — acquired the service last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bending Spoons doesn’t really care about people. Even though I get that it is their private equity strategy, I notice that since I left [WeTransfer] in 2019, there were a lot of updates that were basically killing the product, in my point of view,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the acquisition, WeTransfer made unclear changes to how transfer links work and laid off 75% of its staff. This year, the company sparked controversy over employing its users’ content to train AI models and had to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/wetransfer-backtracks-on-ai-file-training-after-backlash-what-you-need-to-know/\">backtrack on changes to its terms</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after, Nalden says creatives began reaching out to share their frustration with WeTransfer. He realized he wanted to build an alternative to WeTransfer that recaptured the original ethos of the service around simplicity. That service is called Boomerang, and users can transfer files without logging in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Why do tech companies always make things so complicated? I’ve always struggled with this, and I just wanted to offer another tool that [is entirely focused on the] user experience, its ease of use. It’s the simplicity of sharing something quickly and that just saves time.

The startup is focused on essentially one task: preventing damaging water leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers use a lot of water, and that water can present a big risk, even if a leak is small. Founder John Khazraee told TechCrunch that many data centers only have reactive solutions for water leaks. That can saddle companies with downtime and set them back millions of dollars if one occurs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee would know. He spent more than 15 years building infrastructure for IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. With MayimFlow, he’s developed a combination of IoT sensors and edge-deployed machine learning models that can detect signs of impending leaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve noticed these issues in data centers, and the only solution they had was: ‘when the leak happens, we find out,’” he said in an interview. “Now you have to spend a lot of money to go remediate the situation. Now you got to turn off the servers. Now the data is being disrupted. So I decided to do something about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee assembled a small team with plenty of experience to take on this challenge. Jim Wong, MayimFlow’s chief strategy officer, has spent decades working with data centers. Chief technology officer Ray Lok has carved out a career in water management and IoT infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the scariest consequences of unnoticed water leaks, there’s an element of frugality to what Khazraee is trying to do with MayimFlow, which he said comes from his childhood.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I grew up in a very, you know, I don’t want to say the word ‘poor’ family, but we weren’t the most well-off family,” he said. “And my dad would always, when I was taking a shower, tell me, ‘Hey, you’re in the shower too long. Are you singing in there?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As he grew up, Khazraee said he found himself always thinking about how to make things more efficient — especially as he studied to become an engineer. In college, he worked at a facility that collected frying oil from restaurants and converted it to biodiesel. It was a “messy job,” he said, but he liked the end result. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee is now trying to mix this penchant for frugality with the experience of his team. He believes they can give data center operators 24 to 48 hours of advanced warning that repairs will be needed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MayimFlow has collected a glut of sample data from various industrial water systems that allow them to make these kinds of predictions, he said. The company can provide sensors that can help monitor a water system or plug its machine learning models into existing ones if companies already have similar hardware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee said he wants to bring this solution beyond data centers to commercial buildings, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and possibly even utilities. In his eyes, any company that wants to spot leaks early, or optimize water usage, could be a customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee thinks it’s such a big opportunity he’s turned down roles at multiple big tech companies while building MayimFlow over the last two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really believe in the vision. I believe in the impact that we’re making,” he said. “Water is becoming one of those big issues in our world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

I didn’t opt for an Apple Watch because I wasn’t constantly active, I didn’t feel the need to check my notifications, and I didn’t want to think about charging the watch every day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, I got a chance to test the new Google Pixel Watch 4, which made me feel like I might start wearing smartwatches again. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have always had a soft spot for circular watches. One of the first smartwatches I owned was the Moto 360, and I loved its rounded design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel Watch 4 has a curved domed Actua 360 display with thinner bezels as compared to last year’s watch. I have the 41 mm watch as the test unit, but I would personally opt for the 45mm size for battery and a bigger display. The display is also brighter with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and that makes it easier to use in daylight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The battery life is great on the Pixel Watch 4, even with the smaller size. I have managed to get more than a day’s use out of the watch on those days when I have lighter activities.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078508\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the Pixel Watch 4 has a proprietary charger where you can place the watch on the cradle like a puck, the charging speed makes up for it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google advertises that you can charge this watch from 0% to 50% in 15 minutes and from 0% to 100% in 45 minutes. While the real-life timing doesn’t exactly match these numbers, I saw charging times that came close to these figures. The advantage of this rapid charging is that you can always put your watch to charge when you are making a coffee or doing a quick chore within the house, and get enough juice to last you throughout the day.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fitness-and-software\">Fitness and software</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I largely used the Google Pixel Watch 4 to track my pickleball sessions and walking. Apart from calorie burns, there were no particular insights into sports-related movement. For the last 15 days, I started going to a gym, and apart from the treadmill and elliptical mode, there aren’t any specialized modes for particular gym equipment. Instead, you have to select from options for things like core training, weights, or a general workout mode, based on the workout you are doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The watch does have more features for someone who runs — but that’s not possible in Delhi weather with terrible AQI right now. It also detects cardio workouts after 15 minutes of continuous activities, but while walking, these have been hit or miss for me. Another measure that has been off for me has been floor count. On days, I’ve walked to a cafe, I’ve seen a very high count for that, and on days I have gone up to my terrace multiple times, the number of floors climbed is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I am not someone who used to wear my watch or band to sleep. With the Pixel Watch 4, I had to mentally train myself to keep the watch on so I could get a better understanding of sleep and readiness scores. After a few weeks of usage, I regularly wore my watch to sleep. However, you don’t get additional or actionable insights related to sleep or readiness score on the watch in the daily summary. You do get suggestions on the Fitbit app related to readiness, but that’s about it. With fitness apps adding more AI to their apps, Google needs to step up its game.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?w=311\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078520\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=137,300 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=768,1681 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=311,680 311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=548,1200 548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=585,1280 585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=196,430 196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=329,720 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=411,900 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=702,1536 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=936,2048 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=305,668 305w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=171,375 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=282,617 282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=243,531 243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Screenshot by Techcrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s new Material UI design for the watch is refreshing and matches the theme on my Pixel Fold. The weather app is very nice to look at for both hourly and day forecasts. My one gripe is that I wish the exercise app allowed for more than three kinds of workouts to be available through quick start. I could raise my watch to talk to Gemini, which is neat, but beyond starting timers, asking for occasional sports updates, and starting a workout, I have not needed Gemini to be ever-present for me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have been a fan of the recent Pixel Watch 4 update that lets me use the pinch gesture to dismiss notifications, play or pause videos or music, or even move my wrist to dismiss calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The gripes I had about the watch didn’t bother me in daily usage. The display is fantastic, the software and fitness experience overall are great, and the display, along with the new design, is an upgrade from the last generation. However, the thing that drew me the most to the watch and made me stick to it is the combo of battery life and fast charging. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All in all, the Pixel Watch 4 is one of the best Android smartwatches around.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The number of startup funding rounds fell by nearly 39% from a year earlier, to 1,518 deals, according to Tracxn. Total funding slipped more modestly — down just over 17% to $10.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That pullback was not uniform. Seed-stage funding fell sharply to $1.1 billion in 2025, down 30% from 2024, as investors cut back on more experimental bets. Late-stage funding also cooled, slipping to $5.5 billion, a 26% decline from last year, amid tougher scrutiny of scale, profitability, and exit prospects. However, early-stage funding proved more resilient, rising to $3.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079057\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,1000 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,1067 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,358 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,600 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,750 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,667 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1536,1280 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,557 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=450,375 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=740,617 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=637,531 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The capital deployment focus has increased towards early-stage startups,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn, pointing to growing confidence in founders who can demonstrate stronger product–market fit, revenue visibility and unit economics in a tighter funding environment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-ai-quest\">The AI quest</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nowhere was that recalibration clearer than in AI, as AI startups in India raised just over $643 million across 100 deals in 2025, a modest 4.1% increase from a year earlier, per Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. The capital was mainly spread across early and early-growth stages. Early-stage AI funding totaled $273.3 million, while late-stage rounds raised $260 million, reflecting investor preference for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">application-led businesses</a> over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">capital-intensive model development</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was in sharp contrast to the U.S., where AI funding in 2025 surged past $121 billion across 765 rounds, per Tracxn, a 141% jump from 2024, and was overwhelmingly dominated by late-stage deals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t yet have an AI-first company in India, which is $40–$50 million of revenue, if not $100 million, in a year’s time frame, and that is globally happening,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, Swaroop told TechCrunch, lacks large foundational model companies and will take time to build the research depth, talent pipeline, and patient capital needed to compete at that layer — making application-led AI and adjacent deep-tech areas a more realistic focus in the near term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This pragmatism has shaped where investors are placing longer-term bets outside core AI. Venture capital is increasingly flowing into manufacturing and deep-tech sectors. These are some of the areas where India faces less global capital competition and has clear advantages in talent, cost structures, and customer access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/here-are-the-49-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">absorbs a significant share of investor attention</a>, capital in India arguably remains more evenly distributed than in the U.S., with substantial funding still flowing into consumer, manufacturing, fintech, and deep-tech startups. Swaroop noted that advanced manufacturing in particular has emerged as a long-term opportunity, with the number of such startups increasing nearly tenfold over the past four to five years — an area he described as a clear “right to win” for India given lower global capital competition.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, said AI startups accounted for roughly 30–40% of deals in India in 2025, but pointed to a parallel surge in consumer-facing companies as changing behaviour among India’s urban population creates demand for faster, more on-demand services — from quick commerce to household services — categories that play to India’s scale and density rather than Silicon Valley–style capital intensity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-versus-the-u-s\">India versus the U.S.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data from PitchBook shows a stark divergence in capital deployment between India and the U.S. in 2025. U.S. venture funding surged to $89.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone, according to PitchBook data up to December 23, compared with about $4.2 billion raised by Indian startups over the same period.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079058\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=768,581 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=680,515 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1200,908 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1280,969 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=430,325 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=720,545 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=900,681 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=800,605 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1536,1162 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=668,506 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=496,375 496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=815,617 815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=702,531 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, that gap does not tell the whole story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightspeed’s Taneja cautioned against drawing direct parallels between India and the U.S., arguing that differences in population density, labour costs, and consumer behaviour shape which business models can scale. Categories such as quick commerce and on-demand services have found far greater traction in India than in the U.S., reflecting local economics rather than any lack of ambition among founders or investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Lightspeed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lightspeed-raises-record-9b-in-fresh-capital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $9 billion in fresh capital</a> with a strong focus on AI, but Taneja said the move does not signal a wholesale shift in the firm’s India strategy. The U.S. fund, he noted, is geared toward a different market and maturity cycle, while Lightspeed’s India arm will continue backing consumer startups alongside selectively exploring AI opportunities shaped by local demand rather than global capital intensity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nuances-in-india-s-startup-ecosystem\">Nuances in India’s startup ecosystem</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s startup ecosystem also saw funding for women-led startups tighten. Capital invested in women-founded tech startups held relatively steady at about $1 billion in 2025, down 3% from a year earlier, according to Tracxn’s report. Still, that headline figure masked a sharper pullback beneath the surface. The number of funding rounds in women-founded startups fell by 40%, while their first-time funded counterparts declined by 36%.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079059\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg 1510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,89 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,227 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,201 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,354 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,378 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,127 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,213 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,266 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,236 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,197 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1440,425 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=708,209 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,15 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1510px) 100vw, 1510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">India’s women-led startups saw a 3% dip in funding in 2025</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, investor participation narrowed sharply as selectivity increased, with about 3,170 investors taking part in funding rounds in India this year, a 53% drop from roughly 6,800 a year earlier, according to Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. India-based investors accounted for nearly half of that activity, with around 1,500 domestic funds and angels participating — a sign that local capital played a more prominent role as global investors turned cautious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activity also became more concentrated among a smaller group of repeat backers. Inflection Point Ventures emerged as the most active investor, participating in 36 funding rounds, followed by Accel with 34, Tracxn data shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government’s participation in the startup ecosystem became more visible in 2025. New Delhi announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/india-pledges-fresh-billion-for-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.15 billion Fund of Funds</a> in January to expand capital access for startups, followed by a ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation scheme aimed at areas such as energy transition, quantum computing, robotics, space technology, biotech, and AI, using a mix of long-term loans, equity infusions and allocations to deep-tech funds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That push has begun to catalyze private capital as well. The government’s growing involvement helped spur a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nearly $2 billion commitment</a> from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/u-s-and-indian-vcs-just-formed-a-1b-alliance-to-fund-indias-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. and Indian venture capital and private equity firms</a>, including Accel, Blume Ventures, and Celesta Capital, to back deep-tech startups — an effort that also brought Nvidia on board as an adviser and drew Qualcomm Ventures. Furthermore, the Indian government also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/india-eyes-global-quantum-computer-push-and-qpiai-is-its-chosen-vehicle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-led a $32 million funding</a> for quantum computing startup QpiAI earlier this year — a rare federal move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This growing state involvement has helped ease a risk long flagged by investors: regulatory uncertainty. “One of the biggest risks you don’t want to underwrite is what happens if regulation changes,” said Taneja of Lightspeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As government entities become more familiar with the startup ecosystem, Taneja added, policy is more likely to evolve alongside it — reducing uncertainty for investors backing companies with longer development cycles.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-exits-in-india\">Exits in India</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reduced uncertainty has already started to show up in exit markets to some extent. India saw a steady pipeline of technology IPOs over the past two years, with 42 tech companies going public in 2025, up 17% from 36 in 2024, per Tracxn. Much of the demand for those listings has come from domestic institutional and retail investors, easing long-standing concerns that Indian startup exits depend too heavily on foreign capital. M&amp;A activity also picked up, with acquisitions rising 7% year-over-year to 136 deals, Tracxn data shows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop of Accel said investors had long worried that India’s public markets were mainly sustained by foreign capital, raising questions about exit durability during global downturns. “This year has disproven that,” he said, pointing to the growing role of domestic investors in absorbing technology listings — a shift that has made exits more predictable and reduced reliance on volatile overseas flows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079060\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,600 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,531 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,938 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,1000 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,336 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,563 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,703 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,625 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1536,1200 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,522 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=480,375 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=790,617 790w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s unicorn pipeline in 2025 also reflected that shift toward restraint. While the number of new unicorns remained flat year over year, Indian startups reached $1 billion valuations with less capital, fewer funding rounds, and a smaller pool of institutional investors, pointing to a more measured path to scale compared with both previous years and global peers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Challenges remain as India heads into 2026, particularly around how it positions itself in the global race for AI and whether late-stage funding can deepen without relying on outsized capital inflows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even so, the shifts seen in 2025 point to a startup ecosystem that is maturing rather than retreating — one where capital is being deployed more deliberately, exits are becoming more predictable, and domestic market dynamics increasingly shape its growth. For investors, India is emerging less as a substitute for developed markets and more as a complementary arena with its own risk profile, timelines, and opportunities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At TechCrunch Disrupt, three investors — Thomas Green of Insight Partners, Moxxie Ventures’ Katie Stanton, and GV’s Sangeen Zeb — broke down what they’ll be looking for in the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers tell a clear story. Fewer rounds are getting funded but deal sizes have grown, said Green citing a study.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It has never been easier to start a company, and it has never been harder to build something that is defensible,” Stanton said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Zeb, GV uses a specific formula to evaluate companies. The firm analyzes whether startups have achieved product-market fit, examining demand patterns to ensure every quarter outperforms the last. “That sequence should be happening consistently,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanton echoed this priority. “Can you prove that you can repeatedly sell? Can you prove that you can repeatedly grow in a big and growing market?”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Green cautioned that not every company should pursue venture-scale growth. “It’s not worth even taking this money unless you think it can be a really big business, right?” he said. “Most companies should not [pursue] venture scale. They should not take hundreds of millions of dollars.”  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond metrics, all three investors emphasized founder quality. Stanton said she is looking for passionate founders who can endure the long journey of building a company. Zeb agreed. “Passion is still the most important thing,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The panel inevitably turned to AI. Green assured non-AI companies: “Just because you’re not AI doesn’t mean you don’t have a very attractive asset, intrinsic quality to you,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For AI companies trying to differentiate in a crowded market, Green returns to first principles. “We try to understand, if it’s a market with a lot of competition — [including] both incumbents and next-gen competitors and platform players — what is going to be the standout path?”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanton said she looks founders who combine industry and technical expertise, while Zeb prioritizes relentless drive, seeking founders who are constantly asking how to move faster than the competition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite market fluctuations, the panel suggested that core investor priorities remain consistent. “The bar is high, but if the outcome can be impossibly huge, we’ll take that [bet],” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They work for the New York-headquartered nonprofit Access Now, specifically its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://accessnow.org/help/\">Digital Security Helpline</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their mission is to be the team of people who journalists, human rights defenders, and dissidents can go to if they suspect they’ve been hacked, such as with mercenary spyware made by companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/\">NSO Group</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/sanctioned-spyware-maker-intellexa-had-direct-access-to-government-espionage-victims-researchers-say/\">Intellexa</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/paragon/\">Paragon</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The idea is to provide this 24/7 service to civil society and journalists so they can reach out whenever they have… a cybersecurity incident,” Hassen Selmi, who leads the incident response team at the Helpline, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obk5T6kS0WY&amp;t=292s\">According to Bill Marczak</a>, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab who has been investigating spyware for almost 15 years, Access Now’s Helpline is a “frontline resource” for journalists and others who may have been targeted or hacked with spyware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The helpline has become a critical funnel for victims. So much so that when Apple sends its users a so-called “threat notification” alerting them that they have been targeted with mercenary spyware, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/why-apple-sends-spyware-victims-to-this-nonprofit-security-lab/\">the tech giant has long directed victims to Access Now’s investigators</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In speaking with TechCrunch, Selmi described a scenario where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/apple-alerts-exploit-developer-that-his-iphone-was-targeted-with-government-spyware/\">someone gets one of these threat notifications</a>, and where Access Now can help victims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Having someone who could explain it to them, tell them what they should do, what they should not do, what this means… This is a big relief for them,” said Selmi. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to several digital rights experts who have investigated spyware cases and previously spoke with TechCrunch, Apple is generally taking the right approach, even if the optics look like a trillion-dollar tech giant offloading its responsibility to a small team of nonprofit workers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being mentioned by Apple in the notifications, said Selmi, was “one of the biggest milestones” for the helpline.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi and his colleagues now look into about 1,000 cases of suspected government spyware attacks per year. Around half of those cases turn into actual investigations, and only around 5% of them, around 25, result in a confirmed case of spyware infection, according to Mohammed Al-Maskati, the helpline’s director.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Selmi started doing this work in 2014, Access Now were only investigating around 20 cases of suspected spyware attacks per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, there were three or four people working in each timezone in Costa Rica, Manila, and Tunisia, locations that allowed them to have someone online throughout the whole day. The team isn’t that much bigger now, with fewer than 15 people working for the helpline. The helpline has more people in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan region, given that these are hotspots for spyware cases, according to Selmi.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The increase in cases, Selmi explained, is due to several circumstances. For one, the helpline is now more well known, so it attracts more people. Then, with government spyware going global and becoming more available, there are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/why-a-lot-of-people-are-getting-hacked-with-government-spyware/\">potentially more cases of abuse</a>. Finally, the helpline team has done more outreach to potentially targeted populations, finding cases of abuse they may not have found otherwise. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tHave you received a notification from Apple, Google, or WhatsApp about being targeted with spyware? Or do you have information about spyware makers? We would love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When someone contacts the helpline, Selmi told TechCrunch, its investigators first acknowledge receipt, then they do a first check to see if the person who contacted them is within the organization’s mandate, meaning if they are part of civil society — and not, for example, a business executive or lawmaker. Then, the investigators assess the case in triage. If a case is prioritized, the investigators ask questions, such as why the person believes they were targeted (if there was no notification), and what device they own, which helps to establish what kind of information the investigators may need to collect from the victim’s device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After an initial, limited check of the device performed remotely over the internet, the helpline’s handlers and investigators may ask the victim to send more data, such as a full backup of their device, to do a more thorough analysis examining for signs of intrusions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For each known kind of exploit that has been used in the last five years, we have a process on how to check that exploit,” said Selmi, referring to known hacking techniques. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know more or less what is normal, what is not,” said Selmi.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Access Now handlers, who manage communication and often speak the victim’s language, will also give the victim advice on what to do, such as whether to get another device, or take other precautions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every case that the nonprofit looks into is unique. “It’s different from person to person, from culture to culture,” Selmi told TechCrunch. “I think we should do more research, get more people on board — not just technical people — to know how to deal with these kinds of victims.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi said that the helpline has also been supporting similar investigative teams in some regions of the world, sharing documentation, knowledge, and tools, as part of a coalition called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.civicert.org/\">CiviCERT</a>, a global network of organizations that can help members of civil society who suspect they were targeted with spyware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi said this network has also helped to reach journalists and others in places where otherwise they could not get to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“No matter where they are, [victims] have people who could talk to and report to,” Selmi told TechCrunch. “Having these people talk their language and know their context helped a lot.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label.html\">social media platforms should add warning labels</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,” Hochul said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the bill’s sponsors, Assemblymember Nily Rozic, made a similar point in a statement of his own: “New York families deserve honesty about how social media platforms impact mental health. By requiring warning labels based on the latest medical research, this law puts public health first and finally gives us the tools we need to make informed decisions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">California lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/a-new-california-bill-would-add-warning-labels-to-social-media-platforms-233653838.html\">proposed a similar bill.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/09/new-york-moves-to-limit-kids-access-to-addictive-feeds/\">New York passed laws</a> requiring that social media platforms obtain parental consent before showing children “addictive feeds” and before collecting or selling the personal data of users under 18.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t Hochul’s only end-of-year tech regulation; she also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-signs-raise-act-to-regulate-ai-safety/\">recently signed the AI safety-focused RAISE Act</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/judicial-liquidation-for-ynsect-as-insect-farming-sector-struggles-to-become-competitive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">placed into judicial liquidation</a> — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr.’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/robert-downey-jr-is-launching-a-new-rolling-venture-fund-to-back-sustainability-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FootPrint Coalition</a>, taxpayers, and many others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to <a href=\"https://www.ynsect.com/2020/10/06/agtech-startup-ynsect-extends-its-series-c-to-372-million-to-improve-global-food-security-and-sustainability-with-the-first-carbon-negative-and-largest-vertical-farm-in-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“revolutionize the food chain”</a> with insect-based protein. But don’t be too quick to attribute its failure to the “ick” factor that many Westerners feel about bugs. Human food was never its core focus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Ÿnsect focused on producing insect protein for animal feed and pet food, two markets with very different economics and margins that the company never quite chose between.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That indecision extended to its M&amp;A strategy. In 2021, Ÿnsect acquired Protifarm, a Dutch company raising mealworms for human food applications, adding a third market to the mix. Even as the company announced the deal, then-CEO Antoine Hubert <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/ynsect-acquires-mealworm-startup-protifarm-to-scale-into-human-food-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">admitted</a> it would take a couple of years for human food to represent just 10% to 15% of Ÿnsect’s revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We still see pet food and fish feed being the largest contributor to our revenues in the coming years,” Hubert declared at the time. In other words, Ÿnsect was acquiring a company in a market segment that would remain marginal for years — at a time when the startup desperately needed revenue growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And revenue was the problem. According to publicly available data, Ÿnsect’s revenue from its main entity <a href=\"https://www.pappers.fr/entreprise/ynsect-534948617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">peaked</a> at €17.8 million in 2021 (approximately $21 million) — a figure reportedly inflated by <a href=\"https://www.zero-bullshit.fr/p/ynsect-500m-leves-pour-faire-le-ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">internal transfers</a> between subsidiaries. By 2023, the company had racked up a net loss of €79.7 million ($94 million).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So how did a company with such meager revenue raise over $600 million? The answer wasn’t hype-driven crossover funds paying ambitious multiples during the 2021 funding frenzy. Instead, Ÿnsect attracted impact-focused investors like Astanor Ventures and public investment bank <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/bpifrance-machine-powering-french-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bpifrance</a> that bought into a compelling sustainability vision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its pitch to them was simple — offering an alternative to resource-intensive proteins like fishmeal and soy. That same thesis also attracted significant capital to competitors like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/07/better-origin-series-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Better Origin</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/innovafeed-nabs-250m-to-extend-its-vertical-insect-farms-to-the-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Innovafeed</a>, and it seemed promising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the vision collided with market reality. Animal feed is a commodity market driven by price, not sustainability premiums. In a perfect world, insect protein would be fully circular, with insects fed on food waste that would otherwise go to landfill. But in practice, factory-scale insect production typically ends up <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235255092400191X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">relying</a> on cereal by-products that are already usable as animal feed — meaning insect protein just adds an expensive extra step. For animal feed, the math simply wasn’t working.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ÿnsect eventually recognized this. Pet food proved to be a different equation: It is less price-driven than animal feed and a far better market for insect protein, even with competition from other alternative proteins such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/04/lab-grown-meat-britain-eu-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lab-grown meat</a>. By 2023, the company <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/frances-ynsect-refocus-bug-business-after-capital-increase-2023-04-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">refocused its strategy</a> on pet food and other higher-margin segments, with Hubert citing broader economic pressures. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In an environment where there is inflation on energy and raw materials but also on the cost of capital and debt, we cannot afford to invest loads of resources in markets which are the least remunerative (animal feed), while you have other markets where there is a lot of demand, good returns and higher margins,” Hubert said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 2023 pivot to pet food came too late. By then, Ÿnsect had already committed to a massive, capital-intensive bet that would ultimately doom the company. That bet was Ÿnfarm, a “giga-factory” in Northern France that the company billed “the world’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/ynsect-the-makers-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-bug-farm-raises-another-224-million/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most expensive bug farm</a>.” Built for insect production at scale, the facility consumed hundreds of millions in funding — money spent before Ÿnsect had proven its business model or figured out its unit economics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To oversee Ÿnfarm’s launch, Ÿnsect brought in Shankar Krishnamoorthy, a former executive at French energy giant Engie. When that move to pet food failed to save the company, Krishnamoorthy replaced Hubert as CEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ÿnsect then shut down the production plant it had acquired from Protifarm and cut jobs. But shuttering one facility while operating a giga-factory built for the wrong market couldn’t solve the fundamental problem. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company ultimately failed, and in a statement following the liquidation announcement just weeks ago, its newest and last CEO, a turnaround specialist named Emmanuel Pinto, said its remaining assets are now up for grabs. “We hope that the extensive technical and industrial expertise developed by the Ynsect teams, as well as the commercial relationships they have established, will be put to productive use and make a valuable contribution both to Europe’s protein independence and to the fight against climate change,” he wrote in a statement quoted by French media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Professor Joe Haslam, who teaches a course on Scaling Up in the MBA Program at IE Business School, “Ÿnsect’s struggles are not a mystery and not mainly about insects. They are the result of a mismatch between industrial ambition, capital markets, and timing, compounded by some execution and strategy choices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that Ÿnsect failed doesn’t mean the entire insect farming sector is doomed. Competitor Innovafeed is <a href=\"https://www.courrier-picard.fr/id664027/article/2025-10-05/dans-une-filiere-de-la-proteine-dinsectes-en-difficulte-innovafeed-resiste-mieux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly holding up better</a>, in part because it started with a smaller production site and is <a href=\"https://www.lesechos.fr/start-up/next40-vivatech/de-lespoir-fou-a-la-peur-du-crash-comment-ynsect-en-est-arrive-la-2125578\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ramping up</a> incrementally. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Prof. Haslam, Ÿnsect exemplifies a broader European problem. “Ÿnsect is a case study in Europe’s scaling gap. We fund moonshots. We underfund factories. We celebrate pilots. We abandon industrialization. See <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/battery-manufacturer-northvolt-nears-the-end-as-it-files-for-bankruptcy-in-sweden/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Northvolt</a> [a struggling Swedish battery maker], <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/30/mercedes-backed-volocopter-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Volocopter</a> [a German air taxi startup], and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/electric-aircraft-startup-lilium-ceases-operations-1000-workers-laid-off/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lilium</a> [a failed German flying taxi company],” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The failure has prompted some soul-searching. Hubert himself co-founded <a href=\"https://www.startindustrie.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Start Industrie</a>, an association advocating for policies to support French industrial startups — a recognition that Europe needs more than just funding to build the next generation of deep tech companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Remote workers, who miss the everyday interactions found in an office, and younger individuals eager to create their adult social circles based on shared interests and hobbies, are among those seeking meaningful friendships.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thanks to online dating apps, the stigma associated with finding connections online has largely faded away. This has welcomed a new wave of apps focused on fostering friendships and building local communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to estimates from Appfigures, over a dozen local-focused friendship apps have collectively generated approximately $16 million in consumer spending in the U.S. so far this year. Some notable examples include Timeleft, Meet5, and Bumble’s BFF. Additionally, these apps have garnered approximately 4.3 million downloads thus far in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The apps aim to provide a less awkward solution than, for instance, approaching a stranger at the gym or local café and trying to strike up a conversation. These platforms clearly indicate that everyone using the app is looking for the same thing — friendship, not romance — making it much less intimidating to initiate conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From major players like Meetup to newer ones like 222, there are plenty of apps that cater to the growing demand for meaningful friendships.

The app uses a special algorithm to match you with others, taking into account your age, gender, and personality. Users are matched with four other people, but they only learn minor details about them the night before, including their occupations and zodiac signs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dinners take place at a selected restaurant on Wednesday evenings at 7:00 p.m. To help everyone break the ice, the app offers a game with conversation starters. After dinner, there is an after-party at a local bar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can book dinners online or through the <a href=\"https://app.timeleft.com/app/home/event?af_js_web=true&amp;pid=Direct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">app</a>. In terms of pricing, it varies depending on the country and restaurant. Users pay for a ticket up front and are responsible for covering their own dinner and drinks. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wyzr-friends\">Wyzr Friends</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WzyrFriends.jpeg?w=333\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3050916\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WzyrFriends.jpeg 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WzyrFriends.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WzyrFriends.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WzyrFriends.jpeg?resize=242,430 242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WzyrFriends.jpeg?resize=211,375 211w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WzyrFriends.jpeg?resize=299,531 299w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WzyrFriends.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Wzyr Friends</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://wyzrfriends.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wyzr Friends</a> is an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/25/wzyr-friends-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">activity-based friendship app</a> designed for adults 40 and older, catering to empty nesters, those who are divorced, and other users seeking to connect with like-minded individuals.
