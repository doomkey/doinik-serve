Now a general partner at venture firm Playground Global, he’s working with 10 startups. But one portfolio company has captured an outsized share of his attention: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.xlight.com/\">xLight</a>, a semiconductor startup that last Monday <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/what-does-it-mean-when-uncle-sam-is-one-of-your-biggest-shareholders-chip-startup-xlight-is-about-to-find-out/\">announced</a> it has struck a preliminary deal for up to $150 million from the U.S. Commerce Department, with the government set to become a meaningful shareholder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a nice feather in the cap of Gelsinger, who spent 35 years across two stints at Intel before the board showed him the door late last year owing to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/02/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-is-out.html\">lack of confidence</a> in his turnaround plans. But the xLight deal is also shining a spotlight on a trend that’s making people in Silicon Valley quietly uncomfortable: the Trump administration taking equity stakes in strategically important companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What the hell happened to free enterprise?” California Governor Gavin Newsom <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/business/dealbook/newsom-kirk-bessent-dealbook-summit.html\">asked</a> at a speaking event this week, capturing the unease that’s rippling through an industry that has long prided itself on its free-market principles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speaking at one of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC events at Playground Global, Gelsinger — who is xLight’s executive chairman — seemed unbothered by the philosophical debate. He’s more focused on his bet that xLight can solve what he sees as the semiconductor industry’s biggest bottleneck: lithography, the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize chip manufacturing. If the technology works at scale, that is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You know, I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said, referencing the decades-old principle that computing power should double every two years. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s law.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The xLight deal is the first Chips and Science Act award under Trump’s second term, using funding earmarked for early-stage companies with promising technologies. Notably, the deal is currently at the letter of intent stage, meaning it’s not finalized and details could still change. When pressed on whether the funding could end up being double the announced amount — or potentially not materialize at all — Gelsinger was candid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve agreed in principle on the terms, but like any of these contracts, there’s still work to get done,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"X-Light's Nicholas Kelez and Pat Gelsinger on government-backed chips l StrictlyVC Palo Alto\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bvse20xlcOg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technology xLight is pursuing is pretty serious in both scale and ambition. The company plans to build machines roughly 100 meters by 50 meters — about the size of a football field — that will sit outside semiconductor fabrication plants. These free electron lasers would generate extreme ultraviolet light at wavelengths as precise as 2 nanometers, far more powerful than the 13.5 nanometer wavelengths currently used by ASML, the Dutch giant that utterly dominates the EUV lithography market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“About half of the capital goes into lithography,” Gelsinger explained of the entire semiconductor industry. “In the middle of a lithography machine is light. . . [and] this ability to keep innovating for shorter wavelength, higher power light is the essence of being able to continue to innovate for more advanced semiconductors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leading xLight is Nicholas Kelez, whose background is unusual for the semiconductor world. Before founding xLight, Kelez led quantum computer development efforts at PsiQuantum (a Playground Global portfolio company) and spent two decades building large-scale X-ray science facilities at national labs including SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley, where he was Chief Engineer for the Linac Coherent Light Source.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So why is this viable now when ASML abandoned a similar approach almost a decade ago? “The difference was the technology wasn’t as mature,” Kelez explained. Back then, only a handful of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines existed, and the industry had already sunk tens of billions into the incumbent technology. “It just wasn’t the time to take on something completely new and orthogonal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, with EUV ubiquitous in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing and existing light source technology hitting its limits, the timing looks better. The key innovation, according to Kelez, is treating light like a utility rather than building it into each machine. “We go away from building an integrated light source with the tool, which is what [ASML does] now and that fundamentally constrains you to make it smaller and less powerful,” he said. And instead, “We treat light the same way you treat electrical power or HVAC. We build outside the fab at utility scale and then distribute in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is aiming to produce its first silicon wafers by 2028 and have its first commercial system online by 2029. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073618\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are, naturally, hurdles, though right now, competing with ASML directly does not appear to be one of them. “We’re working very closely with them to basically design how we integrate with an ASML scanner,” Kelez said. “So we’re working with both them, as well as their providers, [like] Zeiss, who does their optics.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked whether Intel or other major chipmakers have committed to purchasing xLight’s technology, Gelsinger said they have not. “Nobody has committed yet, but the work is going on with everybody on the list that you would expect, and we’re having intense conversations with all of them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the competitive landscape is heating up. In October, Substrate — a semiconductor manufacturing startup backed by Peter Thiel — announced it raised <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/what-is-substrate-a-thiel-backed-chip-startup-seeking-to-crack-asml-s-dominance?embedded-checkout=true\">$100 million</a> to develop U.S. chip fabs, including an EUV tool that sounds awfully similar to xLight’s approach. Gelsinger doesn’t see them as direct competition though. “If Substrate is successful, they could be a customer for us,” he said, offering that Substrate is focused on building a full-stack lithography scanner that would ultimately need a free electron laser, which is exactly what xLight is developing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gelsinger’s relationship with the Trump administration adds another layer to the story. He brought up xLight to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick back in February, before Playground funded the startup and before Lutnick was confirmed, pitching it as a company that could help bring chip manufacturing back to the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The arrangement has drawn criticism from some who view the administration’s approach as state capitalism, with the government picking winners and losers. But Gelsinger is unapologetic, framing it as necessary for national competitiveness. “I measure it by the results,” he said. “Does it drive the results that we want and that we need to reinvigorate our industrial policies? Many of our competitive countries don’t have such debates. They’re moving forward with the policies that are necessary to accomplish their competitive outcomes.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He pointed to energy policy as another example. “How many nuclear reactors are being built in the US today? Zero. How many being built in China today? 39. Energy policy in a digital AI economy equals the economic capacity of the nation.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073619\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For xLight, the government stake comes with minimal strings attached. The Commerce Department won’t have veto rights or a board seat, says Kelez (pictured above, with Gelsinger). “No information rights, nothing,” Gelsinger adds. “It’s a minority investment, in a non-governing way, but it also says we need this company to succeed for national interest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xLight has raised $40 million from investors including Playground Global and is planning another fundraising round in January. Unlike fusion or quantum computing startups that need billions, Kelez said xLight’s path is more manageable. “This is not fusion or quantum,” he said. “We don’t need billions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also signed a letter of intent with New York to build its first machine at the New York CREATE site near Albany, though that agreement also needs finalization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Gelsinger, xLight is clearly more than just another portfolio company. It’s a chance to cement his relevance in the semiconductor industry that he helped build, even if his methods put him at odds with Silicon Valley’s traditional ethos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked about navigating his principles in the current political environment, Gelsinger retreated to a more technocratic view of corporate leadership — one where the money is from the U.S. government, administrations are temporary, and CEOs must remain above the fray.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“CEOs and companies should neither be Republican or Democrat,” he said. “Your job is to accomplish the business objective, serve your investors, serve your shareholders. That is your objective. And as a result, you need to be able to figure out what policies are beneficial on the R side or what policies are beneficial in the D side, and be able to navigate through them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added separately of that $150 million from the Trump administration, “Taxpayers will do well.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked if working across 10 startups is enough for someone who used to run Intel, Gelsinger was emphatic. “Absolutely. The idea that I can now influence across such a wide range of technologies — I’m a deep tech guy at the core of who I am. My mind is so stretched here, and I’m just grateful that the Playground team would have me to join them and let me make them smarter and be a rookie venture capitalist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He paused, then added with a grin: “And I gave my wife back her weekends.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a nice thought, though anyone who knows Gelsinger’s reputation as a workaholic might wonder how long that arrangement will last.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Paramount was trying to acquire the entire company, while Netflix will only buy the film and television studios, as well as the streaming business, after Warner Bros. moves forward with a plan to spin off its TV networks division.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/david-ellisons-paramount-seen-front-runner-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2025-10-23/\">Paramount was seen as the frontrunner</a>, with its ties to the Trump administration (the studio is now run by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison) easing the way for regulatory approval. But even before the Netflix deal was announced, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-letter-netflix-comcast-warner-bros-1236442793/\">Paramount’s lawyers sent an angry letter</a> complaining about “a tilted and unfair process,” and Netflix soon emerged publicly as the winner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, would presumably face <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/12/netflix-warner-bros-trump-regulatory-approval-1236634472/\">significant regulatory scrutiny</a>, and not just from Trump appointees.

[merger] would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She also argued that antitrust enforcement — including the review process for this deal — must be conducted “fairly and transparently” rather than used to “invite influence-peddling and bribery.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the government ultimately blocks the acquisition, Netflix would be required to pay <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/netflix-s-5-8-billion-breakup-fee-for-warner-among-largest-ever\">a $5.8 billion breakup fee</a>. It’s not clear whether Warner Bros. would then continue operating as an independent company or would reconsider the previous acquisition offers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2025/Dec/05/Netflix-Inc-_M-A-Call_2025-12-05T00_00_00_English.pdf\">held an analyst call</a> to discuss the deal on Friday morning, and while many of the questions were focused on the financial impact on both companies, executives also attempted to address larger concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he’s “highly confident in the regulatory process.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it’s pro-creator, it’s pro-growth,” he said. “And our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarandos also said that Netflix intends to keep HBO “operating largely as it is.” And although it’s not something Netflix has done in the past, Warner Bros. will continue producing TV shows for other networks and streaming services, he said: “We want to keep that successful business operating.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for how HBO and HBO Max would be packaged with or folded into the Netflix app, co-CEO Greg Peters said it’s too early to get into specifics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Needless to say, we think the HBO brand is very powerful for consumers,” Peters said. “We think that the offering could constitute and would constitute a part of our plans and how we structure those for consumers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond general concerns around media consolidation, perhaps the biggest question is to what extent Netflix will support theatrical releases for the combined entity’s films — especially after <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/warner-bros-box-office-historic-streak-conjuring-last-rites-1236510864/\">Warner Bros. had a record-setting run of box office success</a> this year, while Netflix’s theatrical releases only last for a couple weeks at best and skip major theatrical chains because of the limited exclusive window. (This was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/17/stranger-things-creators-may-be-leaving-netflix/\">reportedly the deciding factor when “Stranger Things” creators the Duffer Brothers</a> signed an exclusive deal with Paramount.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For his part, Sarandos said he “wouldn’t look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies or for Warner movies for that matter,” and he noted that Netflix has released 30 movies in theaters this year (though again, usually on fewer screens and for a limited period of time).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, “everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros,” he said. But in the long term, he suggested that “the windows will evolve” so that movies come to streaming more quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don’t really think of that consumer friendly,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The petition, obtained by TechCrunch, alleges that Speed inflicted “irreparable damage” to Rizzbot.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"iShowSpeed Meets Rizzbot..

The petition is asking for compensation for damages, including actual and lost profit, though Rizzbot’s legal team declined to comment on the dollar amount the owner is seeking.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Austin Police had to be called after the incident, according to the petition and a police report obtained by TechCrunch. The responding officer noted damages to Rizzbot done without the owner’s “implied consent,” and that the owner wanted to press charges. The petition states that an investigation is ongoing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speed’s management team did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached, Social Robotics’ lawyer, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.injurylawyeraustintx.com/\">Joel Levine</a>, said the lawsuit came after talks stalled with Speed’s team regarding how to compensate Rizzbot’s owner for the damage done to the robot.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This was an event that was live-streamed so there’s not a ton of discrepancy as to the facts,” Levine told TechCrunch. “What we’re looking for is some accountability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The petition said that Speed “failed to act as a careful, reasonable, and prudent person,” and that he “wrongfully exercised control over,” Rizzbot. It also said that as a result of the destruction, the team behind Rizzbot has lost out on economic opportunities since Rizzbot is indefinitely unable to partake in high-profile appearances and deals, including scheduled upcoming ones with CBS’s The NFL Today and Mr. Beast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is no doubt a monumental setback for the Rizzbot in terms of viral momentum and financial gain from the exposure,” the petition said. “Being in a MrBeast production is akin to being in a Super Bowl Commercial.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The petition read that in the month before the livestream, Rizzbot generated more than 600 million views on TikTok and 200 million on Instagram. In the 28 days after the incident, however, the petition alleges that Rizzbot was unable to make new content and therefore saw a more than 70% decrease in viewership. The “intentional destruction of Rizzbot caused significant financial damage that is likely permanent given the viral nature of social media,” the petition read.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Levine said there has been no formal answer to his plaintiff’s suit just yet and noted that they are still in the very early stages of litigation. When asked for comment, Rizzbot told TechCrunch via email it had to get “a whole new body” after Speed “wrecked” its last one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everything’s brand new except my Nike kicks and cowboy hat,” Rizzbot told TechCrunch in a statement. “Now I’m back online, and I feel like I’ve mastered the rizz game, and next I’ll be working on complex movements with my legs, like twerking – hopefully you’ll see my gyrating hips on some new TV appearances shortly – stay tuned, fam.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Notably, the platform also takes advantage of Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, by giving users a special message from their favorite artist. The feature can be found on the app by tapping on the Library tab.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year’s update features new badges for listeners to showcase. For instance, the “Trendsetter” badge is given to those who listened to trending albums early, while the “Headliner” badge honors fans who rank among the top percentage of an artist’s listeners. There are also new shareable cards designed with a “music festival” theme, tailored specifically for each listener.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, Amazon Music’s equivalent of Spotify Wrapped was “My Year in Review,” a playlist featuring 50 to 100 of the most popular tracks based on your yearly statistics. The playlist is available in the “Playlists” section or “Made For You.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071418\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AmazonMusicTrendsetter.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon Music</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-apple-music-nbsp\">Apple Music </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s music streaming service Apple Music first rolled out its “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/apple-music-introduces-a-replay-a-playlist-of-your-top-songs-of-the-year/\">Replay</a>” experience in 2019.

The app recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/playbook-articles/2025-playback-the-year-you-shaped-the-sound\">launched</a> its SoundCloud 2025 recap, giving you an overview of your top five artists, albums, tracks, and moods. It also shows your total listening time and provides a playlist with your 50 most listened-to songs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, users can also discover their “Music Doppelgänger.” SoundCloud looks at the profiles they follow and determines which user shares the highest music-taste percentage.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-youtube-music-nbsp\">YouTube Music </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube Music’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://music.youtube.com/recap?feature=share\">Recap</a> feature offers a personalized, interactive experience, highlighting the top five artists, songs, moods, genres, albums, and playlists. It also shows your longest listening streak and the total number of minutes you listened in a year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s new this year is an AI-powered “Ask Music” feature that lets users ask questions about their listening history. For example, “How did my listening change over the year?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Access the feature by tapping on the profile avatar in the top-right corner and selecting “Your Recap.” It’s available in the Android and iOS mobile apps. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3072795\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=1200,749 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=1280,799 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=430,269 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=720,450 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=900,562 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=800,500 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=1536,959 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=668,417 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=600,375 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=988,617 988w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=708,442 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/YouTubeRecap-2025.jpeg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>YouTube</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another new addition this year is the video-sharing platform YouTube <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/youtube-releases-its-first-ever-recap-of-videos-youve-watched/\">introduced</a> its own Recap feature, allowing users to view their most-watched videos from 2025. This highlights a user’s favorite channels and interests while showcasing how their viewing habits have changed over time. Additionally, it categorizes users by personality type based on their viewing preferences.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tidal\">Tidal</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike some other music streaming services, Tidal takes a minimalist approach to its recap, focusing on key stats such as top artists, top tracks, and monthly listening. The feature also provides a shareable card highlighting your top 5 artists and songs. Additionally, you receive a custom playlist featuring your most-played songs of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To access your recap, click the notifications bell in your app.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-duolingo-nbsp\">Duolingo </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to music streaming platforms, other platforms are capitalizing on Spotify’s success, including the language-learning app Duolingo. The platform’s “Year in Review” experience is a 10-page summary that reveals insights for all types of learners, including total XP earned, the longest streak, and your learning style.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get your recap, click on the blue Duolingo mascot icon that says “2025” in the bottom left corner of the screen.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-netflix-wrapped\">Netflix Wrapped</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Netflix doesn’t offer its own version of a year-end wrap-up, a video-editing company called Kapwing has developed a <a href=\"https://www.kapwing.com/netflix-wrapped\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tool</a> that uses Netflix viewing data to provide interesting statistics about individual subscribers. This includes insights like subscribers’ “most bingeful day” and total watch time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the tool, simply import your Netflix viewing history. You’ll receive various insights, such as total minutes and days streamed, the top shows and movies watched, significant binges (like when an entire season was watched in one day), and the most-watched movie actor, among other statistics.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wrapped-for-tiktok-nbsp\">Wrapped for TikTok </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2020, TikTok <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/tiktok-launches-its-first-personalized-annual-recap-feature-year-on-tiktok/\">launched</a> a feature that showed how many videos you watched and the engagement on your videos. However, it’s no longer available, prompting people to create their own versions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One such <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wrapped.vantezzen.io/\">tool</a> was developed by Bennett Hollstein. It functions similarly to Kapwing’s tool, enabling users to export their TikTok data. To do this, visit the TikTok <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/setting/download-your-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Settings page</a>, click on “Settings and privacy,” then “Account,” and select “Download your data.” For this tool, it is important to choose “JSON – Machine-readable file” as the file format before uploading this file to “Wrapped for TikTok.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once the file is uploaded, you will then be able to view the total number of videos watched, total watch time, and engagement persona, such as “Interaction Monster.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?w=383\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2923138\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=675,1200 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=720,1280 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=242,430 242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=405,720 405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=506,900 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=450,800 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=376,668 376w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=211,375 211w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=347,617 347w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=299,531 299w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tiktokwrapped.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Vantezzen</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-twitch\">Twitch</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Twitch also provides an annual summary for both viewers and streamers on the platform, providing insights into their most-viewed creators, overall watch time, and more.

It comes after a <a href=\"https://yoodli.ai/blog/announcing-our-13-7m-fundraise-and-launching-the-ai-roleplays-category\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$13.7 million Series A round</a> announced in May, bringing the startup’s total funding to nearly $60 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI tools spread into workplaces and fuel fears of automation, Yoodli positions itself differently. The four-year-old, Seattle-based startup uses AI to run simulated scenarios — including sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions — and provides users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varun Puri (pictured above, right), who previously worked at Google’s X division and handled special projects for Sergey Brin, co-founded Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi (pictured above, left) in 2021. He became aware of communication challenges after moving to the U.S. at 18 and seeing how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals from countries such as India — himself included — Puri said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, Yoodli was meant to help people practice public speaking — a skill two out of three people struggle with, Puri told TechCrunch, citing internal data. However, the startup soon saw users turning to the platform for interview preparation, sales pitches, and difficult conversations. That shift pushed Yoodli from a consumer-focused product to enterprise training, and it now offers AI role-plays and experiential learning tools for go-to-market enablement, partner certification, and management coaching.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg\" alt=\"Yoodli AI roleplays platform\" class=\"wp-image-3073513\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=1200,615 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=1280,656 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=430,220 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=720,369 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=900,461 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=800,410 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=1536,787 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=668,342 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=1204,617 1204w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=708,363 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoodli-platform.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Yoodli’s platform</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Yoodli</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the old world, companies would be training people using static, long-form content or passive videos that we’d all watch at 4x-5x speed, just to get the thing done,” said Puri. “But that doesn’t actually mean you’ve learned it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies including Google, Snowflake, Databricks, RingCentral, and Sandler Sales use Yoodli for employee or partner training. The startup also sells its platform to coaching firms such as Franklin Covey and LHH, which can tailor the system to their own methodology and training frameworks, Puri stated. He added that the tool is not designed to replace human coaches but to keep a human in the loop delivering personalized guidance.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I philosophically believe that AI can get you, let’s call it from a zero to an eight or a zero to nine,” said Puri. “But the pure essence of who you are and how you show up, and your authenticity and vulnerability that a human gives you feedback on will always exist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The platform works with multiple large language models, meaning users can run it with models such as Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s GPT based on their preference. Enterprises can also embed it into their existing software, or users can access it directly through a web browser. The AI supports most major languages, including Korean, Japanese, French, Canadian French, and a list of Indian languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yoodli does not offer a dedicated mobile app, a decision Puri said was made to avoid adding extra steps for users during training sessions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg\" alt=\"Yoodli team\" class=\"wp-image-3073512\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yoodli-team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Yoodli’s team</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Yoodli</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Puri did not disclose how many people use the platform but said most of Yoodli’s revenue now comes from enterprise customers. He added that between the Series A and B rounds, Yoodli saw a 50% increase in the number of role-plays run on the platform and in the total time users spent practicing. The startup also said it grew its average recurring revenue by 900% over the last 12 months, though it did not provide specific figures. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yoodli had not planned to raise more funding so soon after its last round but saw unanticipated investor interest, with WestBridge leading the latest raise, Puri said. He noted that strong performance metrics, key customers, and senior hires helped attract investors. The startup has recently hired former Tableau and Salesforce executive Josh Vitello as chief revenue officer (CRO), former Remitly CFO Andy Larson as CFO, and former Tableau chief product officer (CPO) Padmashree Koneti as CPO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yoodli is not alone in the market for AI-based communication tools, but Puri told TechCrunch the startup differentiates itself through deep customization and a focus on specific training verticals, allowing companies to tailor the system to their use cases and coaching methods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Seattle-headquartered startup has about 40 employees. Puri said the latest funding will be used to expand Yoodli’s AI coaching, analytics, and personalization tools, and to grow its presence in enterprise learning and professional development. The company also plans to hire across product, AI research, and customer success, and to expand into markets in the Asia-Pacific region while deepening its footprint in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Although some equity was acquired at a $1 billion valuation, a lower valuation for other investors resulted in a blended valuation below $1 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. Multi-tier valuations within the same round are an unusual mechanism in venture capital, but investors say they are becoming increasingly common for desirable AI startups in the current market. This approach allows the company to report a higher “headline” valuation while simultaneously offering better terms to specific investors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aaru and Redpoint Ventures didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exact round size couldn’t be learned, but one person said that it is above $50 million.

Waymo said as soon as the issue was identified it updated its software on November 17. The company contends this update has meaningfully improved performance to a level better than human drivers in this important area.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Software recalls have become more common in the age of modern passenger vehicles — and now robotaxis — in which operations are handled by software. These updates, or fixes, are often made prior to the official recall but still carry weight when filed with the federal government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s decision follows increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and criticism by officials in Atlanta and Austin over how its robotaxis perform around school buses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened its initial investigation</a> into Waymo in October after seeing footage of its autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus — with its stop sign extended and lights flashing — that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other similar incidents popped up in Austin, where the company also operates a robotaxi service with partner Uber. Austin School District officials contend, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INOT-PE25013-30888P1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a letter </a>available on NHTSA’s website, that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agency sent a letter December 3 to Waymo asking for more information about its self-driving system and operations following reports from the Austin School District that its robotaxis illegally passed school buses 19 times this year. Regulators <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INIM-PE25013-30896.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">requested detailed information</a> about its fifth-generation self-driving system and operations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Waymo Chief Safety Officer Mauricio Peña said in an emailed statement. “As a result, we have made the decision to file a voluntary software recall with NHTSA related to appropriately slowing and stopping in these scenarios. We will continue analyzing our vehicles’ performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">No injuries occurred related to the vehicle behavior addressed by this recall, according to the company, which has emphasized that safety is its top priority and it will continue to work with NHTSA.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says it will continue to investigate, track, and implement more updates as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo made a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/waymo-recalls-1200-robotaxis-following-low-speed-collisions-with-gates-and-chains/\">voluntary software recall </a>earlier this year as well as two in 2024, including one that was issued after a Waymo vehicle in Phoenix, driving without a human safety operator, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/waymo-second-robotaxi-recall-autonomous-vehicle/\">collided with a telephone pole</a> in an alley during a low-speed pullover maneuver.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s up from around 50 violations NHTSA cited when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-for-traffic-safety-violations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened an investigation into the behavior</a> in October. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The federal safety agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is probing whether Tesla’s driver assistance software can “accurately detect and appropriately respond to traffic signals, signs and lane markings,” according to the letter. ODI is also evaluating whether Tesla’s software is providing sufficient warnings to drivers in these situations. Tesla’s responses are due January 19, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The increase in complaints is notable in part because the original batch reported by ODI in October included multiple reports from one particular intersection in Joppa, Maryland. Tesla told the agency at the time that it had already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection.” The agency didn’t say where, geographically, these newly reported incidents took place. Tesla heavily redacts <a href=\"https://fuelarc.com/tech/redacted-tesla-asked-for-redactions-on-every-self-driving-crash-reported-to-the-nhtsa-since-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its own submissions</a> to the agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new letter was sent to Tesla the same week that CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/musk-says-new-tesla-software-allows-texting-and-driving-which-is-illegal-in-most-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">claimed in a post on X</a> that the latest version of FSD will allow drivers to text and drive while using the driver assistance software, which is illegal in nearly every state. NHTSA has not responded to requests for comment about Musk’s statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter is meant to kick off the discovery process for NHTSA, and as such it details a number of requests for information the agency has made to Tesla. For instance, the agency is asking for data on how many Tesla vehicles are equipped with FSD, as well as how often the software is engaged. ODI is also asking Tesla to turn over any customer complaints it has received regarding these specific problems with FSD, including from fleet operators and from any lawsuits or third-party arbitration proceedings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the second investigation that NHTSA has opened into Tesla’s FSD software. In October 2024, the agency began a probe into how FSD handles <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-by-federal-safety-regulator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">low-visibility situations like fog or extreme sunlight</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Drawing on his engineering background, he decided to build the device himself, using a more than century-old technology: the electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect and measure electrical activity in the brain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While EEG is used clinically to diagnose diseases such as epilepsy and sleep disorders, it can also detect psychological stress by measuring high-frequency brain waves called beta waves. When those rapid beta waves persist for extended periods, they can lead to exhaustion, insomnia, and mental distress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Forenza collaborated with data scientists and biomedical engineers to develop <a href=\"https://www.awear.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Awear</a>, a small device worn behind the ear for continuous brainwave monitoring. The device transmits results to an app, which provides information about the wearer’s mood and offers AI-powered coaching advice for managing stress and improving emotional resilience.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our brain is phenomenal at self-adjusting and makes us believe we are not stressed,” Forenza said. “It’s fine to be in ‘fight or flight’ every once in a while. It’s part of our nature. But if you fall into the trap of constant ‘fight or flight’, then that leads to chronic stress, depression, anxiety.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Forenza claims that Awear helps users proactively intercept excessive stress before it leads to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">negative health effects</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Awear is a Startup Battlefield 200 finalist at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2025&amp;utm_content=ticketsales&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>,  where it won health category pitch competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Stanford University’s psychiatry department is currently testing the device to detect confusion and disorientation in elderly patients after surgery, Forenza’s primary focus is on selling Awear to individual consumers, similar to the approach taken by the Oura ring and other consumer wearables.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, Awear closed a pre-seed funding round led by Hustle Fund, Niremia Collective, Techstars, and The Pitch Fund, and the company plans to raise a $5 million seed round in early 2026.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Awear is available for purchase only through its early-access program. The device is available to early adopters — a group that already includes many other startup founders, a notoriously stressed-out group — for $195, which includes a complimentary lifetime app subscription.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After raising its seed round, the company will launch a Kickstarter campaign, following a strategy used by devices such as Peloton and Oura. “It is a path that worked for many other wearables. It gives you a lot of visibility, and it’s a good way to acquire customers,” Forenza said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company, which made an AI-powered pendant to record your conversations, says it will no longer sell its hardware devices and will maintain support for its existing customers for a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software “Rewind,” which recorded users’<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/01/rewind-wants-to-revamp-how-you-remember-with-millions-from-a16z/\"> desktop activity</a> and turned it into a searchable record.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettbejcek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Brett Bejcek</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dsiroker?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dan Siroker,</a> the co-founder and former chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Optimizely</a>, pivoted to become an AI device maker last year, offering its Limitless pendant for $99. The wearable could attach to your shirt like a wireless mic or be worn like a necklace. The device is one of several AI hardware devices on the market, including another (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/magazine/friend-wearable-ai-companion.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">not very well-received</a>) AI pendant known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/friend-delays-shipments-of-its-ai-companion-pendant/\">Friend</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Limitless’ announcement, the company shares in Meta’s vision to “bring personal superintelligence to everyone,” which includes building AI-enabled wearables. (Meta is focused for now on AR/AI glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta, and its in-lens AI glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display.) Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life — which likely means supporting Meta’s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/altman-describes-openais-forthcoming-ai-device-as-more-peaceful-and-calm-than-the-iphone/\">larger players like OpenAI</a> and Meta are developing their own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">hardware</a> devices, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,” wrote Siroker in the announcement. “AI was a pipe dream to many. Hardware startups were considered unfundable, and a business that did both AI and hardware would have been considered ludicrous. But today is different. The world has changed. We’re no longer working on a weird fringe idea. We’re building a future that now seems inevitable. We’re not alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta shared the following statement with TechCrunch via email: “We’re excited that Limitless will be joining Meta to help accelerate our work to build AI-enabled wearables.” The tech giant didn’t share further information about its plans, beyond noting that the team will work in the wearables organization of Reality Labs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Limitless will offer its customers a way to <a href=\"https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13004987-how-to-download-your-limitless-transcripts-and-account-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">export</a> their data, the company said, or users can choose to <a href=\"https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13005203-how-to-delete-your-limitless-account-and-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delete</a> their data from within the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/a16z-backed-rewind-pivots-to-build-ai-powered-pendant-to-record-your-conversations/\">raised</a> more than $33 million in funding from investors, including a16z, First Round Capital, and NEA. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Limitless has been acquired by Meta\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uuGTJzl1OVU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated after publication with Meta’s comment. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Today, the OpenAI-owned AI chatbot remains the leader in the space, accounting for 50% of global downloads on mobile devices and 55% of the global monthly active users.

(The monthly active user numbers in the above chart are rounded, the firm notes.) This figure could suggest the AI chatbot is nearing market saturation, Sensor Tower says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Google Gemini’s global monthly active users jumped by around 30% during the same time frame, as the release of its new image generation model, Nano Banana, drove increased adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the report noted that around two times more U.S. Android users now engage with Gemini directly through the Android operating system compared with using the standalone Gemini mobile app. This could provide Google with a competitive advantage in the global market, where Android dominates, as it means Gemini isn’t constrained to only being used within a mobile app or web interface.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini is also increasing its share of the overall AI chatbot market when compared across all top apps like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok.

As of November, Gemini users were spending 11 minutes per day in the app, up 120% from March. This is likely due to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/gemini-tops-the-app-store-thanks-to-new-ai-image-model-nano-banana/\">popularity</a> of its image generation model, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/google-geminis-ai-image-model-gets-a-bananas-upgrade/\">Nano Banana</a>, in September. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s users’ daily time spent only increased by 6% during the same time frame.

AI for enterprise was everywhere. But are its customers just as eager?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS CEO Matt Garman acknowledged during his keynote that enterprises haven’t seen a return on AI investment yet. He thinks that’s about to change — and fast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe that the advent of AI agents has brought us to an inflection point in AI’s trajectory,” Garman said. “It’s turning from a technical wonder into something that delivers us real value. This change is going to have as much impact on your business as the internet or the cloud.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While analysts told TechCrunch they were impressed by some of AWS’ tech announcements this week, they aren’t sure it’s enough to move the needle on enterprise AI adoption or change AWS’ position in the AI race.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is one of the market leaders when it comes to cloud infrastructure; the same can’t be said for its enterprise AI offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google hold a commanding lead when it comes to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">enterprise market share</a> for actual AI models. AWS does have the advantage of having everything in house, including infrastructure and its own AI training chips.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Naveen Chhabra, a principal analyst at Forrester, told TechCrunch over email that while AWS announced a lot of cool new technology, it doesn’t change the fact that many enterprises aren’t ready to adopt AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AWS AI announcements show that AWS is thinking ahead and maybe far too ahead,” Chhabra wrote. “Most enterprises are still piloting AI projects and are rarely at the levels of maturity AWS expects them to be to take advantage of the offerings that come out of these announcements.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A widely cited <a href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MIT study</a> from August found that 95% of enterprises aren’t seeing a return on investment from AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ethan Feller, an equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told TechCrunch in a phone interview that the new Nova AI models, agents, and model-building capabilities weren’t what stood out to him as interesting from this week — despite these being the products AWS hyped the most. Instead, it was the infrastructure announcements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AWS AI factory is really compelling,” Feller said about a new initiative that allows customers to run <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\">AWS AI in their own data centers</a>. “AWS is a huge player in where the models are being run and is dominant in the cloud industry. I think that is where Amazon’s expertise really lies. It’s a good thing to double down on where they have expertise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Feller likes that AWS is looking to make a vertical AI play, but he thinks it may make more sense to do so through partnerships with other AI players like Anthropic and Nvidia as opposed to using all of their own AI technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite all of this, AWS is still well-positioned to carve out market share in the AI sector, while continuing to grow its core businesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS’ position as an industry-leading cloud provider means it has a solid business foundation despite what happens in the AI market because it provides the rails for the industry’s technology — regardless of what the AI trend of the moment is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the AI industry ends up being the bubble some say it is, AWS, which recorded <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/aws-exceeds-wall-streets-expectations-as-demand-for-cloud-infra-remains-high/\">$11.4 billion in operating income</a> in the third quarter, will likely be less affected by a negative change in AI market conditions than its peers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This gives AWS room to experiment and iterate on what its place in the AI market could look like down the road. That’s why even if enterprises aren’t ready for the tech they release today, AWS should keep working to improve it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>, and see all the announcements <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/all-the-biggest-news-from-aws-big-tech-show-reinvent-2025/\">you may have missed thus far here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

One key advantage of these eSIM-only phones is that they offer slightly larger battery life than the models with a physical SIM slot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Analytics firm Counterpoint said that in 2024, the penetration of smartphones with eSIM was just 23%. The U.S. is the strongest market for eSIM, with 41% of devices launched in 2024 having eSIM capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until recently, eSIM has been a feature of top-end devices, but that is changing slowly. GSMA said that just in the first half of 2025, brands have launched more than 60 eSIM-enabled smartphones.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">China can be a major factor in eSIM’s adoption. This October, after the launch of Apple’s eSIM-only phone and a few hiccups, China’s telecom providers began offering eSIM support. Pablo Iacopino, an analyst at GSMA, said local manufacturers like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo will also likely launch more eSIM-native or supported devices.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071149\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg 1245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,106 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,271 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,240 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=1200,423 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=430,152 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=720,254 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=900,317 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=800,282 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=668,236 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=708,250 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,18 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>GSMA</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These manufacturers have a big share in economically sensitive markets in Asia and Africa. They can gradually include eSIM support across price ranges to support the domestic demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Chinese brands, when they see that the Chinese MNOs have launched eSIM services for the domestic Chinese market, they will probably start introducing eSIM across a wider range of smartphones, including, medium and low-end market,” Iacopino said. “But I don’t think they will go eSIM only immediately. They will start with supporting both physical and eSIM, before shifting to eSIM-only models.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, even within devices with eSIM support, few people are using the technology — but that’s changing. Steffen Sorrell, head of research at Kaleido Intelligence, a telecom analyst firm, said that it observed a 30% activation rate in devices with eSIM capabilities in 2024. The firm estimates that the rate will go up to 75% by 2030.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-travel-is-a-big-catalyst\">Travel is a big catalyst</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While you are traveling, eSIM is one of the most convenient ways to get connectivity. A GSMA survey said that 51% of people using eSIM use it for travel. Plus, it is a more secure solution, given that often eSIM hardware is bound with secure hardware elements, making it difficult to tamper with.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These elements have been positive for eSIM provider startups Airalo, Holafly, eSIM.me, Nomad, and Truely. Even the Lithuania-based security provider Nord launched an <a href=\"https://saily.com/blog/category/news/page-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eSIM service called Saily</a>. Most of these companies have seen growth in their customer base, and that’s largely thanks to travel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GSMA said that travel is currently proving to be a strong catalyst for eSIM growth, as frequent travelers prefer to buy devices with eSIM support. Plus, they could adopt eSIM for their long-term usage.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071150\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg 1570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=768,396 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=1200,619 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=1280,660 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=430,222 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=720,371 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=900,464 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=800,413 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=1536,792 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=668,345 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=1196,617 1196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=708,365 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kaleido Intelligence</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People might experience eSIM for the first time while traveling. These users who like the eSIM experience would go back home and request their network providers to make a switch from a physical SIM,” GSMA’s Iacopino told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airalo is one of the biggest eSIM companies around and has been active for more than six years. The company’s CEO, Bahadir Ozdemir, said that the app is responsible for many users experiencing eSIM for the first time. The company did a survey on its app last year, with 85% of responders being first-time eSIM users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Roughly 15% of travel connectivity is being powered by eSIMs, and the number is growing. Once users discover how they can get connectivity with eSIM, they don’t really want to go back to the old way [physical SIMs] of doing it,” Ozdemir noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said that while a lot of telecom operators offer eSIMs, it is not easy for customers to discover those, and apps like Airalo make the process easier. Network providers are also thinking about the travel eSIM market. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.com/news/corporate-and-financial/vodafone-launches-major-partnership-with-uefa-and-uc-3-to-power-the-future-of-women-s-and-men-s-football\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vodafone partnered with UEFA to launch a specialized eSIM</a> for travelers attending football matches across the continent.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-growth-and-investor-interest\">Growth and investor interest</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Travel-related eSIM startups have seen notable growth. Truely said it has served more than 70,000 travelers over the last two years, with 2x order growth this year. The startup, which raised a <a href=\"https://e27.co/truely-tops-up-funding-to-us5-5m-to-boost-travel-connectivity-solutions-20250602/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$2 million extension round in June</a>, said that apart from partnering with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/truely_truely-moneyx-esim-activity-7361495714272595968-YJiE/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fintech services</a> and <a href=\"https://farefirst.truely.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">travel apps</a>, it is also exploring governmental collaborations in different regions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NordVPN said that its Saily eSIM app saw a seven-digit user base after its launch in March 2024. The company also launched <a href=\"https://nordsecurity.com/press-area/travel-esim-app-saily-debuts-ultra-a-new-premium-plan-for-unparalleled-journeys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a $60 per month Ultra plan with global coverage</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071151\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg 673w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=430,259 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=668,403 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=622,375 622w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>GSMA</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Holafly said that it has sold more than 15 million eSIMs since its inception in 2018 and has crossed $500 million in total revenue. The startup noted that out of that figure, it earned $200 million in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airalo’s blockbuster <a href=\"https://www.cvc.com/media/news/2025/airalo-becomes-the-first-esim-unicorn-with-an-investment-round-of-220m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$220 million round, led by CVC and announced in July</a>, made it a unicorn and was the most notable eSIM investment in the last two years. Meanwhile, French eSIM startup Kolet nabbed <a href=\"https://www.phocuswire.com/kolet-raises-10-million-dollars-series-a-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$10 million in Series A funding</a> led by Daphni with participation from former Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern and Apple’s former vice president of marketing Jon Gieselman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scott Shiao, a principal at Goodwater Capital, said that the investment concentration will be on travel-related eSIM startups on the consumer side for the time being, but there could be an opportunity in domestic markets in the future as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Martell Hardenberg, a partner at Antler, said that while the travel eSIM use case has grown, a lot of users can be considered early adopters, and there is still much room to grow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there is opportunity in offering bundled services to global travelers or digital nomads about what can companies offer beyond travel SIM cards and make it a lucrative package for these user profiles,” Hardenberg told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors will likely look for offering, marketability for long-term bet as there might be consolidation a few years down the line, Kaledio’s Sorrell said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The market is obviously on its way up, but I think sooner or later we’re going to reach a saturation point in terms of the providers on the market there. So investors will look into the long-term viability of the business along with things like customer loyalty, quality of coverage, and even association with marketing capabilities, how you’re able to promote that eSIM, whether it’s through airlines, banks, or cab companies,” he said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-challenges-in-adoption\">Challenges in adoption</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A couple of roadblocks in adoption are education, trust, and ease of use. A lot of people just don’t know what an eSIM is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Spotify can tell people to download Spotify because people know about music, and Netflix can tell people to download Netflix because people know about TV shows,” Airalo’s Ozdemir said. “But we couldn’t do that with Airalo, as a lot of people don’t know about eSIMs.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He noted that the company regularly partners with different influencers to educate people about connectivity on the go through eSIM and redirects them to Airalo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truely CEO Eric Dadoun believes that given there is a steady rise in devices that are eSIM only, consumers would be forced to know about the technology as well. He said that companies working in the eSIM industry will still focus on user education for customer acquisition in markets where buying an eSIM-only device is optional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the thornier parts of using an eSIM is that when you buy a plan from any of the apps, you get a QR code in your email that you need to scan to install the eSIM. This means that you need a second device that displays the QR code. The whole process is cumbersome if you are visiting another country and you want to buy an eSIM when you are at an airport. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GSMA’s Iacopino agreed that the process is cumbersome for many users, and as adoption grows, eSIM providers and hardware makers will need to figure out a way to make the process smooth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kaleido Intelligence’s Sorrell noted that for some network providers, the move to eSIM is slower, as they have legacy technology and systems that are proving to be a roadblock. They would also need to make the process of switching to this tech fully digital so customers don’t have to visit a store. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The expansion is called “A Safehouse in the Hills” and is available starting December 10.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if the vans in the trailer have been, in true Grand Theft Auto fashion, hijacked by playable characters, or if they’ve gone rogue. It seems likely it’s the latter, though, as Rockstar Games says players will be encouraged to “stop the development of a mass surveillance network in an all-new action-packed adventure” as part of the DLC. (The trailer also teases a storyline that involves an AI assistant named “Haviland,” so the tech world in general appears to be a part of this particular storyline.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has said it will deny government requests for the footage its vehicles capture if those requests are “overly broad and unlawful.” But its robotaxis have nevertheless drawn criticism for being part of a growing surveillance state. That frustration has contributed to the company’s vehicles becoming a target of multiple instances of vandalism. Waymo SUVs have been burned, smashed, and had their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/waymo-cameras-capture-footage-of-man-charged-in-alleged-robotaxi-tire-slashings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tires slashed</a> in different cities over the last few years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rockstar is clearly tapping into those same dynamics here, as the tagline for KnoWay’s “autonomous hailing system” in the game is: “We Kno where you’re going.” It’s not hard to imagine some players of the DLC taking some of their frustrations out on the virtual vehicles once the update is released later this month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo declined to comment. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/waymo-co-ceo-on-robotaxi-vandalism-were-not-standing-for-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spoke out</a> against the vandalism, saying her company was “very focused on working with law enforcement to make sure that we pursue the people who are committing these crimes against our fleet.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He lost, but the moment forever changed the way he saw the place — and local governments, for that matter. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was trying to become a better candidate,” he recalled to TechCrunch. “I wanted to understand how my city actually worked, what decisions had been made, why, who said what. And I couldn’t figure it out. It’s a total black box, and almost intentionally opaque.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since COVID, towns across the nation have started recording and posting their city meetings online. That gave Rajaraman an idea: a company that helped people understand what was happening in local governments. That same year, in 2022, he launched Hamlet to do just that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We use AI to process thousands of hours of city council and planning commission meeting videos and turn them into intelligence they can actually use,” he said. He said these videos are better than meeting minutes because those documents are just someone’s interpretations of what happened. “The video doesn’t lie.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At first, he thought it would be a media company, but then real estate developers and political action committees started reaching out. Rajaraman realized that private companies have to deal with local governments, too, and they also want more insight into what is happening in those city council meetings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For enterprise customers, the company helps track agendas and alerts them when relevant topics are addressed across target cities. It also synthesizes what happened after meetings, so they don’t have to watch hourslong videos, and it lets them search the video archive to see, for example, when and how a competitor was mentioned in a local government setting.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hamlet has raised around $10 million in venture funding to date, from backers including Slow Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Banana Capital, and Kapor Capital. “We want to become the ‘Bloomberg’ of this space, so to speak,” Rajaraman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, Rajaraman announced he is expanding the company to launch Hamlet TV as a way to help keep regular citizens informed of what is happening inside their governments. The streaming channel is on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@my_hamlet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6OdfDFY578UcEzOf_jv37Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">YouTube,</a> AppleTV, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/my_hamlet_tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Instagram</a>, and will spotlight important moments from council, commission, and school board meetings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rajaraman said his company has processed thousands of hours of government meetings for government customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen meetings that have lasted 15-plus hours without recess,” he said. He and his team started curating funny moments from those meetings, and they thought it was a good idea to use humor to get people more invested in the U.S. democracy. “If you show people procedural videos, they are just not going to care. But if you show them the funny stuff, they’ll watch.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most surprising thing he and his team have seen so far on Hamlet TV has been someone dressing up as a cockroach to address their city council about a pest problem. But it’s not the funny stuff that surprises him, he said. “It’s how consequential these meetings are and how invisible they remain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He cited an example from earlier this year when the Tucson city council rejected Amazon’s $3.6 billion data center. He said that the decision came after months of planning, but only a few people likely watched those videos to understand why it happened.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t Rajaraman’s first time running a business — or a media outlet. He co-founded the analytics platform Scripted and was twice an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Foundation Capital. He also ran a publication called The Bold Italic, then sold it to Medium.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He knows Hamlet TV probably won’t be a moneymaker and reiterated that he’s doing this to get people more involved with the state of the country’s democracy. He also plans to give away the Hamlet tool to local journalists for free. “Data is great, but context matters so much,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next, the Hamlet company is looking to work with government affairs, advocacy organizations, and renewable energy developers. “Democracy works better when people are watching,” he said. “We’re trying to make watching possible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
