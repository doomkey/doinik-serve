They can analyze vast amounts of transaction data in real time. Meanwhile, sales organizations are using AI agents to gather data on potential customers. These AI sales agents can scour the web and social media for information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be effective, these agents need to access the internet and find information from relevant sources, all while following company policies and mirroring how a human researcher would work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Connecting an agent directly to a large language model like ChatGPT without company-specific safeguards can lead to highly inappropriate results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Governance, risk and compliance at the enterprise is so important now, and if you just let that happen, it’s just going to be the wild, wild west,” George Mathew, managing director at Insight Partners, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Insight Partners led a $20 million Series A in Tavily, a startup that connects AI agents to the web in a way that’s compliant with company-specific policies. The investment brings the one-year-old Tavily’s total funding to $25 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded last year by data scientist Rotem Weiss, Tavily began as an open-source project he created in 2023 called GPT Researcher. The consumer-focused project fetched real-time web data before ChatGPT was hooked up to the internet, Weiss told TechCrunch. “It went extremely viral, so pretty fast we gained almost 20,000 GitHub stars.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weiss launched Tavily after ChatGPT and other LLMs introduced web search. Unlike GPT Researcher, Tavily focuses on enterprise clients. It provides a suite of tools to companies like Groq, Cohere, MongoDB, and Writer, allowing their agents to search, crawl, and extract structured insights from both public and private sources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While most AI agents aren’t yet connected to the internet, Weiss says Tavily’s goal is to onboard the next billion agents to the web.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tavily is not the only startup providing search tools for AI agents. It competes with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/exa-raises-17m-lightspeed-nvidia-ycombinator-google-ai-models/\">Exa</a>, which raised a $17 million Series A from Lightspeed, Nvidia, and YC last year. Another smaller startup that offers a web search connectivity layer is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/a-job-ad-for-y-combinator-startup-firecrawl-seeks-to-hire-an-ai-agent-for-15k-a-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Firecrawl</a>.  OpenAI and Perplexity are also offering search solutions that are geared towards independent developers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

More recently, however, politics has fully entered the world of cybersecurity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, President Donald Trump <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/trump-orders-federal-investigation-into-former-cisa-director-chris-krebs/\">ordered an investigation into former CISA director Chris Krebs</a>, who had publicly rebuffed Trump’s false claims about election fraud by declaring the 2020 election secure. Trump later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trump-fires-us-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs-for-debunking-false-election-claims/\">fired Krebs by tweet</a>. The investigation ordered by Trump months after his 2024 reelection forced Krebs to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/former-cisa-director-chris-krebs-vows-to-fight-back-against-trump-ordered-federal-investigation/\">step down from SentinelOne and vow to fight back</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, Jen Easterly, another former CISA director and Krebs’ successor, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-we-really-securing-jen-easterly-auyae/\">called on the cybersecurity community to get involved</a> and speak out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If we stay silent when experienced, mission-driven leaders are sidelined or sanctioned, we risk something greater than discomfort; we risk diminishing the very institutions we are here to protect,” Easterly wrote in a post on LinkedIn. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Easterly was herself <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/jen-easterly-west-point-mcdermott-chair-laura-loomer-dan-driscoll-army/\">a victim of political pressure</a> from the Trump administration when she got the offer to join West Point rescinded in late July. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deibert, who this year <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chasingshadowsbook.ca/\">published his new book</a>, <em>Chasing Shadows: Cyber Espionage, Subversion, And The Global Fight For Democracy</em>, is echoing the same message as Easterly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that there comes a point at which you have to recognize that the landscape is changing around you, and the security problems you set out for yourselves are maybe trivial in light of the broader context and the insecurities that are being propelled forward in the absence of proper checks and balances and oversight, which are deteriorating,” said Deibert.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deibert is also concerned that big companies like Meta, Google, and Apple could take a step back in their efforts to fight against government spyware — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#spyware-commercial-government\">sometimes referred to as</a> “commercial” or “mercenary” spyware — by gutting their threat intelligence teams. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These threat intelligence teams are dedicated groups of security researchers that track government hackers, both those working inside government agencies, such as China’s Ministry of State Security, or Russia’s intelligence agencies FSB and GRU, as well as companies such as NSO Group or Paragon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These are the same teams that are responsible for detecting hacks against their own users, such as when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/30/eight-things-we-learned-from-whatsapp-vs-nso-group-spyware-lawsuit/\">WhatsApp caught NSO Group</a> hacking more than 1,400 of its users in 2019, or when Apple catches hackers using government spyware to target its customers and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/\">notifies</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/apple-alerted-iranians-to-iphone-spyware-attacks-say-researchers/\">the</a> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/apple-alerts-iphone-users-in-98-countries-to-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">victims</a> of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/why-apple-sends-spyware-victims-to-this-nonprofit-security-lab/\">attacks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deibert is concerned that these teams could be cut or at least reduced, given that the same companies have cut their moderation and safety teams. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He told TechCrunch that threat intelligence teams, like the ones at Meta, are doing “amazing work,” in part by staying siloed and separate from the commercial arms of their wider organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But the question is how long will that last?” said Deibert.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs during the June and expects to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/apple-projects-tariff-costs-will-hit-1-1b-next-quarter/\">spend $1.1 billion in the next quarter</a>, CEO Tim Cook said during an earnings call last month. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Meta-owned social network is also launching reposts, and making its “Friends” tab in Reels available globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its new map feature, Instagram is copying yet another popular feature from Snapchat, after cloning the app’s core Stories functionality <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/instagram-stories/\">back in 2016</a>. Instagram is coming for Snap Map’s crown, a feature that recently surpassed 400 million monthly active users and remains one of the app’s core offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instagram notes that location sharing is off by default on Instagram Map, and a user’s location only updates when they open the app, meaning it doesn’t provide real-time location updates. Snap Map, on the other hand, allows users to choose whether their location is updated only when they open the app or in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Instagram does offer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/instagram-takes-on-snapchat-with-new-location-sharing-feature/\">real-time location sharing via DMs</a> (direct messages). However, unlike Apple’s Find My and Snap Map, which let you share your location with others indefinitely, Instagram only lets users do so for up to one hour. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034355\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png 2120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Instagram-map_zoomed-in.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Instagram</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instagram says the new map feature will make it easier for friends to coordinate and link up for hangouts. It also lets users explore location-based content that their friends and favorite creators have shared or engaged with. For example, if your friend attends a nearby music festival and posts a story while there, it will appear on the map. Similarly, if a creator posts a reel about a new restaurant in your city, you’ll be able to discover it on Instagram Map.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regardless of whether you choose to share your location, you can use the map to explore location-based content, Instagram says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The map also allows users to leave short messages, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/instagram-now-supports-text-updates-with-launch-of-notes-adds-other-new-sharing-features/\">“Notes,”</a> on the map for others to see.

These reposts may show up in their friends’ feeds and will also be displayed in a new “Reposts” tab on their profile. Instagram says the new feature gives users a way to share their interests with others and also offers creators the opportunity to reach a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To repost a reel or post, users tap the repost icon. Users can also choose to add a note to the repost by typing into the thought bubble that appears on screen and pressing save.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regarding the new “Friends” tab in Reels, Instagram launched it in the United States earlier this year and is now making it available globally. The tab lets you see public reels that your friends have liked, commented on, reposted, and created.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For users who want to browse and interact with content privately, Instagram is rolling out the ability to opt out of having content you’ve engaged with shown in the friends tab. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can hide their likes, comments, and reposts from the tab. Additionally, they can choose to mute likes, comments, and reposts from specific people they follow.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During Match’s second-quarter earnings call, Match Group CEO Spencer Raskoff said that Tinder will debut a new feature called “modes,” which will allow users to switch between different dating goals to explore new connections in real-time. This is similar to a previous option where Tinder allowed users to put their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/14/tinder-launches-relationship-goals-feature/\">relationship goals directly on their profiles</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder will also explore a broader redesign and other new features, including those aimed at college students, to drive more usage among Gen Z. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another new feature allows users to like specific parts of a profile, nudging people to start conversations based on those likes, similar to Match’s dating app Hinge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes arrive amid a mixed quarter for the dating app giant, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-05/match-plans-50-million-product-investment-after-upbeat-forecast\">reported</a> flat year-over-year revenue of $864 million and earnings that declined from $133.3 million year-over-year to $122.5 million in Q2. However, the company provided a better-than-expected Q3 outlook with revenue reaching $910-920 million, which boosted its stock post-earnings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Match also announced it would invest $50 million in product development, as the dating app maker aims to connect with younger Gen Z users and use AI to improve its products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ll take the first steps towards a new UI refresh in Q3 with a cleaner, faster, and more modern look across the entire app,” Raskoff said. “We’re on track to test version one of a redesigned ‘see who likes you’ tab this fall with the goal of helping users connect with people they’re more likely to be interested in, as well as to drive more revenue,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of the latter, Tinder continues to experiment with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/tinder-will-try-ai-powered-matching-as-the-dating-app-continues-to-lose-users/\">AI-powered matching</a>, which it debuted in New Zealand earlier this year. The feature delivers curated matches based on information from your Tinder profile, answers to questions, and, optionally, insights from the user’s camera roll photos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company intends to roll out this feature to more geographies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The interactive matching experience we’ve been testing in New Zealand is specifically designed to appeal to this type of audience [users under 30]: Somebody who doesn’t just want to be judged based on their physical appearance. [The feature is for] somebody who instead is willing to put in a little bit of time, answer some questions, and then get a custom result back,” Raskoff said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, Raskoff noted that Tinder is thinking about launching more college-specific features, including allowing users to just search within their college or other selected colleges, to appeal to younger users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also offered an update on Tinder’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/you-can-now-arrange-a-double-date-with-friends-on-tinder/\"> Double Date option</a>, launched in June, that lets users pair up with a friend to match with another couple. The dating company said it saw positive results with 92% of users utilizing the feature being under 30.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3019017\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tinder_DoubleDate_PressAsset.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tinder</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was Raskoff’s first full quarter at the helm of Match Group, as Zillow Group co-founder and Match Board member was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ir.mtch.com/investor-relations/news-events/news-events/news-details/2025/Spencer-Rascoff-Appointed-Match-Group-Chief-Executive-Officer/default.aspx\">appointed</a> CEO in February. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, the company announced that Faye Iosotaluno would step down from the app’s CEO position in July, with Raskoff taking on the role.

Large enterprises with trade secrets, companies in highly regulated industries, and government agencies have thought more than twice about bringing in AI tools out of concern that their — or worse, their customers’ — data could inadvertently be compromised, or used to train foundation models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canadian AI firm <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/cohere/\">Cohere</a> is taking aim at alleviating those concerns with its new AI agent platform dubbed North, which promises to enable private deployment so that enterprises and governments can keep their and customers’ data safe behind their own firewalls. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“LLMs are only as good as the data they have access to,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/15/cohere-co-founder-nick-frossts-indie-band-good-kid-is-almost-as-successful-as-his-ai-company/\">Nick Frosst</a>, co-founder and CEO of Cohere, said during a demo of North. “If we want LLMs to be as useful as possible, they have to access that useful data, and that means they need to be deployed in [the customer’s] environment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of using enterprise cloud platforms like Azure or AWS, Cohere says it can install North on an organization’s private infrastructure so that it never sees or interacts with a customer’s data. North can run on an organization’s on-premise infrastructure, hybrid clouds, VPCs, or air-gapped environments, Frosst said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can deploy literally on a GPU in a closet that they might have somewhere,” he explained, adding that North was designed to run on as few as two GPUs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cohere claims North also includes security protocols like granular access control, agent autonomy policies, continuous red-teaming, and third-party security tests. And, it meets international compliance standards like GDPR, SOC-2, and ISO 27001.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-than-private-deployments\"><strong>More than private deployments</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034577\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png 1776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=1200,743 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=1280,793 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=430,266 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=720,446 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=900,557 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=800,495 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=1536,951 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=668,414 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=605,375 605w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=996,617 996w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=708,439 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/table.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Cohere</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cohere, which has so far <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/22/cohere-raises-500m-to-beat-back-generative-ai-rivals/\">raised</a> $970 million, most recently at a $5.5 billion valuation, said it has already piloted North with some customers such as RBC, Dell, LG, Ensemble Health Partners, and, as TechCrunch reported last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/cohere-is-quietly-working-with-palantir-to-deploy-its-ai-models/\">Palantir</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">North mirrors many AI agent platforms right out of the box. Its chief features are chat and search, which let users get answers to customer support inquiries; summarize meeting transcripts, write marketing copy, and access information from both internal resources and the web. Frosst added that all responses include citations and “reasoning” chains of thought so employees can audit and verify the output.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The chat and search functions are powered by existing Cohere technology, like Command (its family of generative AI models), and Compass (its multimodal search tech stack). Frosst said North is powered by a variant of its Command model that is trained for enterprise reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It goes beyond just Q&amp;A and gets into doing work for you. So, [North] has a bunch of asset creation. It can make tables, it can make documents, it can make slideshows. It can do a bunch of market research,” Frosst said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that in May, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/ai-startup-cohere-acquires-ottogrid-a-platform-for-conducting-market-research/\">Cohere acquired Ottogrid</a>, a Vancouver-based platform that develops enterprise tools for automating high-level market research. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other AI agent platforms, North can connect to existing workplace tools like Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, Outlook and Linear, and integrate with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to access industry-specific or in-house applications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As you build confidence by chatting to the model, there’s like a smooth transition that happens between using this as an augmentation to using it as an automation,” Frosst said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/two-chinese-nationals-california-accused-illegally-shipping-nvidia-ai-chips-2025-08-05/\">report by Reuters</a> specifically named Nvidia’s H100 GPUs as the chips being shipped.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A review of export documents by the DOJ found that ALX Solutions sent chips and other tech to shipping and freight-forwarding companies in  Singapore and Malaysia, but received payments from entities in Hong Kong and China in return. The department also found records of communication regarding shipping the tech to Malaysia to specifically go around U.S. export restrictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This case demonstrates that smuggling is a nonstarter,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “We primarily sell our products to well-known partners, including OEMs, who help us ensure that all sales comply with U.S. export control rules. Even relatively small exporters and shipments are subject to thorough review and scrutiny, and any diverted products would have no service, support, or updates.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes as the U.S. tries to figure out how to strike a balance between fostering global AI innovation and imposing export restrictions to China, which many in the West perceive to be a major threat in the AI race. The Trump administration’s recently-announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-action-plan-aims-to-block-chip-exports-to-china-but-lacks-key-details/\">AI Action Plan</a> belabored the importance of having strong export restrictions, but was light on details.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One potential solution to curb chip smuggling that has been suggested by the U.S. government in recent days is to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-05/us-explores-better-location-trackers-for-ai-chips-official-says\">implement tracking technology into chips</a> to help catch smuggling, but chipmakers are quite opposed to such a move. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/no-backdoors-no-kill-switches-no-spyware/\">blog post on Tuesday</a>, Nvidia said its GPUs do not include kill switches or backdoors, and argued that building in such tools would only result in compromising security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nvidia has been designing processors for over 30 years. Embedding backdoors and kill switches into chips would be a gift to hackers and hostile actors,” the company wrote. “It would undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in U.S. technology. Established law wisely requires companies to fix vulnerabilities — not create them.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s not sound policy. It’s an overreaction that would irreparably harm America’s economic and national security interests,” Nvidia wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia did not immediately return requests for additional comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>For more on the semiconductor industry’s tumultuous year so far, here’s a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/a-timeline-of-the-u-s-semiconductor-market-in-2025/\">regularly updated timeline</a> of market news since the beginning of 2025.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Locket has already tested this feature with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://locket.cam/sukiwaterhouse\">Suki Waterhouse</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://locket.cam/jvke\">JVKE</a>, with more artists to be announced soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the feature, celebrities can share a link on their social media platforms, or fans can look them up in the app to add them, and they can then send photos directly to their fans’ home screens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With posts going straight to fans’ home screens, it offers the kind of immediacy and intimacy that other platforms can’t replicate, turning passive followers into active participants,” founder Matt Moss told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Locket allows artists to choose a number of fans to connect with, ranging from 1,000 to 15,000 slots. For instance, Suki has 5,000 fans on the app and has helped Locket attract hundreds of new members. According to the company, 17% of these 5,000 fans were new to Locket.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fans feel special knowing they’re one of just a few thousand rather than just another follower. This also preserves the same intimacy and brand of Locket as a product today … We knew our community used Locket to share music with their friends, so being able to also connect with their favorite artists is a natural evolution for the platform,” Moss said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Moss says the feedback from testers has been good, it’s unclear whether this will help Locket grow its user numbers. BeReal tried something similar with a feature called “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/bereal-which-now-has-23m-daus-is-onboarding-brands-and-celebs/\">RealPeople</a>,” but the reception wasn’t entirely positive, with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bereal_app/comments/135tq7y/a_timeline_for_influencers_celebrities_really/\">some</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bereal_app/comments/1e6ki8c/sorry_but_what_in_the_world_is_bereal_thinking/\">people</a> saying that they preferred the anti-social media app as a way to escape from celebrities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s perfect for building autonomous assistants or embedding AI into real-world workflows, even in bandwidth-constrained environments.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched on Tuesday, OpenAI’s gpt-oss-20b can run on consumer PCs and laptops with at least 16GB of VRAM, which a modern GPU from Nvidia or Radeon would have. OpenAI said the model was trained using <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/03/inside-openais-quest-to-make-ai-do-anything-for-you/\">high-compute reinforcement learning</a>, which helps it excel at powering AI agents and call tools, such as web search or Python code execution, as part of its chain-of-thought process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the model is text-only, meaning it will not be able to process or generate images and audio like the company’s other models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also, the model has a habit of hallucinating a lot: gpt-oss-20b hallucinated in response to 53% of questions on PersonQA, OpenAI’s in-house benchmark for measuring the accuracy of a model’s knowledge about people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft says it will bring the model to macOS soon, as well as other devices, though the company did not name any more. Microsoft is also making both gpt-oss-20b and older model gpt-oss-120b available via its hosted Azure AI Foundry platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two new models are also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/for-the-first-time-openai-models-are-available-on-aws/\">available on Amazon’s AWS</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Called European Search Perspective (EUSP), the JV now aims to serve around 50% of French queries and 33% of German queries by the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Qwant said it is using the new index to power some of its features, like AI summaries for search, and Ecosia has plans to add some AI features soon to its platform, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EUSP is also in talks with companies to spur the adoption of its index for enabling search within apps. Notably, it is targeting chatbots, presenting Staan as a cheaper alternative to Google and Bing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re using ChatGPT or any other AI chatbot, they all do knowledge grounding with web search […] our index can power deep research and AI summary features. Google and Bing’s solutions are also pricey, and our index can offer power search features at a tenth of the cost,” Christian Kroll, CEO of Ecosia, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EUSP, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/protons-new-privacy-first-ai-assistant-encrypts-all-chats-keeps-no-logs/\">Proton</a>, is pushing to develop a European tech stack that doesn’t rely on technology from the U.S. or China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The timing could not be more urgent. The outcome of the 2024 U.S. election has reminded European policymakers and innovators just how exposed Europe remains when it comes to core digital infrastructure. Much of Europe’s search, cloud, and AI layers are built on American Big Tech stacks, putting entire sectors – from journalism to climate tech – at the mercy of political or commercial agendas,” the companies said in a statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kroll added that through this index, combined with European privacy laws, EUSP can offer a more privacy-friendly search solution as compared to its U.S. counterparts.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For AWS, it finally puts the cloud giant in the same sentence as the biggest model maker, OpenAI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until now, AWS has best been known as a major host and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/22/anthropic-raises-an-additional-4b-from-amazon-makes-aws-its-primary-cloud-partner/\">financial backer</a> of Anthropic’s Claude, one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors. AWS offers Claude, along with other models from makers such as Cohere, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/\">DeepSeek</a>, Meta, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/what-is-mistral-ai-everything-to-know-about-the-openai-competitor/\">Mistral</a>, as well as its own home-grown ones in its AI services. Specifically, Bedrock allows AWS customers to build and host generative AI apps using models of their choice. SageMaker, on the other hand, allows AWS customers to train, or even build, their own AI models largely for analytics uses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AWS’s ultimate rival, Microsoft, hasn’t <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-is-no-longer-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider/\">had a lock on OpenAI models since January,</a> Azure is still OpenAI’s most significant cloud partner to date. OpenAI even announced that Microsoft is offering versions of these two new models, too, optimized for Windows devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Watching Microsoft win an increasing amount of cloud business with OpenAI has been a public pain in Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s neck. Just last week during <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-amazon-q2-2025-earnings-beat-expectations-93CH-4164802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon’s quarterly earnings call</a>, Jassy was pounded with questions from Wall Street analysts about how the company was losing ground in AI to competitors, particularly Microsoft.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Jassy to explain “significantly faster cloud growth among the number two and number three players in the space,” referring to Microsoft and Google. Later, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak told Jassy that Wall Street thinks “AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss, peers, etc.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jassy responded with a minutes-long diatribe that included this barb at Redmond: “I think the second player is about 65% of the size of the AWS.”<br><br>Meanwhile, another AWS competitor, Oracle, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/openai-agreed-to-pay-oracle-30b-a-year-for-data-center-services/?_thumbnail_id=1361055\">reported that it signed a $30 billion a year deal with OpenAI</a> to offer data center services. This means that OpenAI plans to pay Oracle more each year than all of its other cloud services customers combined. Until now, AWS had been left out of any OpenAI-related glory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for how such a move with AWS benefits OpenAI: The AI provider’s relationship with Microsoft <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/the-cracks-in-the-openai-microsoft-relationship-are-reportedly-widening/\">is notoriously strained</a>, as the two are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/microsoft-in-talks-to-maintain-access-to-openais-tech-beyond-agi-milestone/\">reportedly renegotiating their long-term partnership</a> deal. What better way for OpenAI to strengthen its position than to cozy up the biggest cloud provider, even if, initially, on a small scale?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, this partnership allows swaths of AWS enterprise customers to easily experiment with using OpenAI models with their hosted AI apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile Altman gets to undercut Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg with this move as well. As OpenAI releases these two high-performing models under an Apache 2.0 open source license, Meta recently admitted that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-meta-likely-wont-open-source-all-of-its-superintelligence-ai-models/\">it probably won’t continue to open source all of its upcoming “superintelligence” models.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But in the years after Twitter’s acquisition by Elon Musk, there has been an increased interest in building with this protocol as competitors to Twitter (now called X) emerged. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta launched its alternative to X in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/threads-metas-twitter-competitor-is-now-live/\">2023 with Instagram Threads</a>, which has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/threads-is-nearing-xs-daily-app-users-new-data-shows/\">catching up to</a> X on mobile devices.

Both are freely available to download from the online developer platform <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hugging Face</a>, the company said, describing the models as “state of the art” when measured across several benchmarks for comparing open models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models come in two sizes: a larger and more capable gpt-oss-120b model that can run on a single Nvidia GPU, and a lighter-weight gpt-oss-20b model that can run on a consumer laptop with 16GB of memory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch marks OpenAI’s first ‘open’ language model since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/\">GPT-2</a>, which was released more than five years ago. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a briefing, OpenAI said its open models will be capable of sending complex queries to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/openai-wants-its-open-ai-model-to-call-models-in-the-cloud-for-help/\">AI models in the cloud,</a> as TechCrunch previously reported. That means if OpenAI’s open model is not capable of a certain task, such as processing an image, developers can connect the open model to one of the company’s more capable closed models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI open sourced AI models in its early days, the company has generally favored a proprietary, closed source development approach. The latter strategy has helped OpenAI build a large business selling access to its AI models via an API to enterprises and developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, CEO Sam Altman said in January he believes OpenAI has been “on the wrong side of history” when it comes to open sourcing its technologies. The company today faces growing pressure from Chinese AI labs — including DeepSeek, Alibaba’s Qwen, and Moonshot AI — which have developed several of the world’s most capable and popular open models. (While Meta previously dominated the open AI space, the company’s Llama AI models have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/05/meta-releases-llama-4-a-new-crop-of-flagship-ai-models/\">fallen behind</a> in the last year.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July, the Trump administration also urged U.S. AI developers to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">open source more technology</a> to promote global adoption of AI aligned with American values.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div

class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the release of gpt-oss, OpenAI hopes to curry favor with developers and the Trump administration alike, both of which have watched the Chinese AI labs rise to prominence in the open source space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Going back to when we started in 2015, OpenAI’s mission is to ensure AGI that benefits all of humanity,” said Altman in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “To that end, we are excited for the world to be building on an open AI stack created in the United States, based on democratic values, available for free to all and for wide benefit.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

In a white paper, OpenAI says this is “expected, as smaller models have less world knowledge than larger frontier models and tend to hallucinate more.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI found that gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b hallucinated in response to 49% and 53%, respectively, of questions on PersonQA, the company’s in-house benchmark for measuring the accuracy of a model’s knowledge about people. That’s more than triple the hallucination rate of OpenAI’s o1 model, which scored 16%, and higher than its o4-mini model, which scored 36%.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-training-the-new-models\">Training the new models</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says its open models were trained with similar processes to its proprietary models. The company says each open model leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) to tap fewer parameters for any given question, making it run more efficiently. For gpt-oss-120b, which has 117 billion total parameters, OpenAI says the model only activates 5.1 billion parameters per token.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also says its open model was trained using high-compute <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/03/inside-openais-quest-to-make-ai-do-anything-for-you/\">reinforcement learning (RL)</a> — a post-training process to teach AI models right from wrong in simulated environments using large clusters of Nvidia GPUs. This was also used to train OpenAI’s o-series of models, and the open models have a similar chain-of-thought process in which they take additional time and computational resources to work through their answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of the post-training process, OpenAI says its open AI models excel at powering AI agents and are capable of calling tools such as web search or Python code execution as part of its chain-of-thought process. However, OpenAI says its open models are text-only, meaning they will not be able to process or generate images and audio like the company’s other models.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is releasing gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b under the Apache 2.0 license, which is generally considered one of the most permissive. This license will allow enterprises to monetize OpenAI’s open models without having to pay or obtain permission from the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, unlike fully open source offerings from AI labs like AI2, OpenAI says it will not be releasing the training data used to create its open models. This decision is not surprising given that several active lawsuits against AI model providers, including OpenAI, have alleged that these companies inappropriately trained their AI models on copyrighted works.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/openais-open-model-is-delayed/\">delayed</a> the release of its open models <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/\">several</a> times in recent months, partially to address safety concerns. Beyond the company’s typical safety policies, OpenAI says in a white paper that it also investigated whether bad actors could fine-tune its gpt-oss models to be more helpful in cyberattacks or the creation of biological or chemical weapons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After testing from OpenAI and third-party evaluators, the company says gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities. However, it did not find evidence that these open models could reach its “high capability” threshold for danger in these domains, even after fine-tuning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI’s model appears to be state-of-the-art among open models, developers are eagerly awaiting the release of DeepSeek R2, its next AI reasoning model, as well as a new open model from Meta’s Superintelligence Lab.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And this is a controversy that will certainly grow as AI agents flood the internet: Should an agent accessing a website on behalf of its user be treated like a bot? Or like a human making the same request?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare is known for providing anti-bot crawling and other web security services to millions of websites. Essentially, Cloudflare’s test case involved setting up a new website with a new domain that had never been crawled by any bot, setting up a robots.txt file that specifically blocked Perplexity’s known AI crawling bots, and then asking Perplexity about the website’s content. And Perplexity answered the question. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare researchers found the AI search engine used “a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS” when its web crawler itself was blocked. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince <a href=\"https://x.com/eastdakota/status/1952379571527193017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted </a>the research on X, writing, “Some supposedly ‘reputable’ AI companies act more like North Korean hackers. Time to name, shame, and hard block them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But many people disagreed with Prince’s assessment that this was actual bad behavior. Those defending Perplexity on sites <a href=\"https://x.com/Chikor_Zi/status/1952382355059913193\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like X</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44785636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hacker News</a> pointed out that what Cloudflare seemed to document was the AI accessing a specific public website when its user asked about that specific website. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If I as a human request a website, then I should be shown the content,” one person on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44786039\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hacker News</a> wrote, adding, “why would the LLM accessing the website on my behalf be in a different legal category as my Firefox web browser?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Perplexity spokesperson <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/perplexity-accused-of-scraping-websites-that-explicitly-blocked-ai-scraping/\">previously</a> denied to TechCrunch that the bots were the company’s and called Cloudflare’s blog post a sales pitch for Cloudflare. Then on Tuesday, Perplexity <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/agents-or-bots-making-sense-of-ai-on-the-open-web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published a blog</a> in its defense (and generally attacking Cloudflare), claiming the behavior was from a third-party service it uses occasionally.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the crux of Perplexity’s post made a similar appeal as its online defenders did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The difference between automated crawling and user-driven fetching isn’t just technical — it’s about who gets to access information on the open web,” the post said. “This controversy reveals that Cloudflare’s systems are fundamentally inadequate for distinguishing between legitimate AI assistants and actual threats.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity’s accusations aren’t exactly fair, either. One argument that Prince and Cloudflare used for calling out Perplexity’s methods was that OpenAI doesn’t behave in the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI is an example of a leading AI company that follows these best practices,” <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cloudflare wrote</a>. “They respect robots.txt and do not try to evade either a robots.txt directive or a network level block. And ChatGPT Agent is signing http requests using the newly proposed open standard Web Bot Auth.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Web Bot Auth</a> is a Cloudflare-supported standard being developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force that hopes to create a cryptographic method for identifying AI agent web requests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The debate comes as bot activity reshapes the internet. As TechCrunch has previously reported, bots seeking to scrape massive amounts of content to train AI models <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/open-source-devs-are-fighting-ai-crawlers-with-cleverness-and-vengeance/\">have become a menace</a>, especially to smaller sites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the first time in the internet’s history, <a href=\"https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/2025-bad-bot-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bot activity is currently outstripping human activity online</a>, with AI traffic accounting for over 50%, according to Imperva’s Bad Bot report released last month. Most of that activity is coming from LLMs. But the report also found that malicious bots now make up 37% of all internet traffic. That’s activity that includes everything from persistent scraping to unauthorized login attempts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until LLMs, the internet generally accepted that websites could and should block most bot activity given how often it was malicious by using CAPTCHAs and other services (such as Cloudflare). Websites also had a clear incentive to work with specific good actors, such as Googlebot, guiding it on what not to index through robots.txt. Google indexed the internet, which sent traffic to sites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, LLMs are eating an increasing amount of that traffic. Gartner predicts <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">that search engine volume</a> will drop by 25% by 2026. Right now humans tend to click website links from LLMs at the point they are most valuable to the website, which is when they are ready to conduct a transaction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if humans <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent/\">adopt agents</a> as the tech industry predicts they will — to arrange our travel, book our dinner reservations, and shop for us — would websites hurt their business interests by blocking them? The debate on X captured the dilemma perfectly:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I WANT perplexity to visit any public content on my behalf when I give it a request/task!” wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/denisandrejew/status/1952384393147736294\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one person</a> in response to Cloudflare calling out Perplexity. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/denisandrejew/status/1952384393147736294\"><br><br></a>“What if the site owners don’t want it? they just want you [to] directly visit the home, see their stuff” <a href=\"https://x.com/khanhicetea/status/1952387322332471658\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">argued another</a>, pointing out that the site owner who created the content wants the traffic and potential ad revenue, not to let Perplexity take it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is why I can’t see ‘agentic browsing’ really working — much harder problem than people think. Most website owners will just block,” <a href=\"https://x.com/jwblackwell/status/1952384112364548402\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a third</a> predicted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It applies to companies both local and foreign, and it can affect both providers and deployers of AI systems; the European Commission cites examples of how it would apply to a developer of a CV screening tool and to a bank that buys that tool. Now all of these parties have a legal framework that sets the stage for their use of AI.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-does-the-eu-ai-act-exist\">Why does the EU AI Act exist?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As usual with EU legislation, the EU AI Act exists to make sure there is a uniform legal framework applying to a certain topic across EU countries — the topic this time being AI. Now that the regulation is in place, it should “ensure the free movement, cross-border, of AI-based goods and services” without diverging local restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With timely regulation, the EU seeks to create a level playing field across the region and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/\">foster trust</a>, which could also create opportunities for emerging companies. However, the common framework that it has adopted is not exactly permissive: Despite the relatively early stage of widespread AI adoption in most sectors, the EU AI Act sets a high bar for what AI should and shouldn’t do for society more broadly.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-the-purpose-of-the-eu-ai-act\">What is the purpose of the EU AI Act?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to European lawmakers, the framework’s main goal is to “promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy AI while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI systems in the Union, and to support innovation.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, that’s quite a mouthful, but it’s worth parsing carefully. First, because a lot will depend on how you define “human centric” and “trustworthy” AI. And second, because it gives a good sense of the precarious balance to maintain between diverging goals: innovation vs. harm prevention, as well as uptake of AI vs. environmental protection. As usual with EU legislation, again, the devil will be in the details.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-does-the-eu-ai-act-balance-its-different-goals\">How does the EU AI Act balance its different goals?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To balance harm prevention against the potential benefits of AI, the EU AI Act adopted a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/eu-council-gives-final-nod-to-set-up-risk-based-regulations-for-ai/\">risk-based approach</a>: banning a handful of “unacceptable risk” use cases; flagging a set of “high-risk” uses calling for tight regulation; and applying lighter obligations to “limited risk” scenarios.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-has-the-eu-ai-act-come-into-effect\">Has the EU AI Act come into effect?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes and no. The EU AI Act rollout started on August 1, 2024, but it will only come into force through a series of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/eus-ai-act-gets-published-in-blocs-official-journal-starting-clock-on-legal-deadlines/\">staggered compliance deadlines</a>. In most cases, it will also apply sooner to new entrants than to companies that already offer AI products and services in the EU.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first deadline came into effect on February 2, 2025, and focused on enforcing bans on a small number of prohibited uses of AI, such as untargeted scraping of internet or CCTV for facial images to build up or expand databases. Many others will follow, but unless the schedule changes, most provisions will apply by mid-2026.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-changed-on-august-2-2025\">What changed on August 2, 2025?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since August 2, 2025, the EU AI Act applies to “general-purpose AI models with systemic risk.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPAI (general-purpose AI) models are AI models trained with a large amount of data, and that can be used for a wide range of tasks. That’s where the risk element comes in. According to the EU AI Act, GPAI models can come with <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/faqs/general-purpose-ai-models-ai-act-questions-answers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">systemic risks</a> —  “for example, through the lowering of barriers for chemical or biological weapons development, or unintended issues of control over autonomous [GPAI] models.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahead of the deadline, the EU published <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/learn-more-about-guidelines-providers-general-purpose-ai-models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">guidelines</a> for providers of GPAI models, which include both European companies and non-European players such as Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI. But since these companies already have models on the market, they will also have until August 2, 2027, to comply, unlike new entrants.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-the-eu-ai-act-have-teeth\">Does the EU AI Act have teeth?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EU AI Act comes with penalties that lawmakers wanted to be simultaneously “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” — even for large global players.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Details will be laid down by EU countries, but the regulation sets out the overall spirit — that penalties will vary depending on the deemed risk level — as well as thresholds for each level. Infringement on prohibited AI applications leads to the highest penalty of “up to €35 million or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The European Commission can also inflict fines of up to €15 million or 3% of annual turnover on providers of GPAI models. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-fast-do-existing-players-intend-to-comply\">How fast do existing players intend to comply?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">voluntary GPAI code of practice</a>, including commitments such as not training models on pirated content, is a good indicator of how companies may engage with the framework law until forced to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July 2025, Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/meta-refuses-to-sign-eus-ai-code-of-practice/\">announced it wouldn’t sign</a> the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">voluntary GPAI code of practice</a> meant to help such providers comply with the EU AI Act. However, Google soon after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/google-says-it-will-sign-eus-ai-code-of-practice/\">confirmed it would sign</a>, despite reservations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai#ecl-inpage-Signatories-of-the-AI-Pact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Signatories</a> so far include Aleph Alpha, Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and OpenAI, among others. But as we have seen with Google’s example, signing does not equal a full-on endorsement.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-have-some-tech-companies-been-fighting-these-rules-nbsp\">Why have (some) tech companies been fighting these rules? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While stating in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/eu-ai-code-practice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> that Google would sign the voluntary GPAI code of practice, its president of global affairs, Kent Walker, still had reservations. “We remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe’s development and deployment of AI,” he wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta was more radical, with its chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan stating in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joel-kaplan-63905618_europe-is-heading-down-the-wrong-path-on-activity-7351928745668055042-XuF7/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on LinkedIn that “Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI.” Calling the EU’s implementation of the AI Act “overreach,” he stated that the code of practice “introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">European companies have expressed concerns as well. Arthur Mensch, the CEO of French AI champion Mistral AI, was part of a group of European CEOs who <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/top-european-ceos-plead-for-pause-in-ai-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed an open letter</a> in July 2025 urging Brussels to <a href=\"https://aichampions.eu/#stoptheclock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“stop the clock”</a> for two years before key obligations of the EU AI Act came into force.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-will-the-schedule-change\">Will the schedule change?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early July 2025, the European Union responded negatively to lobbying efforts calling for a pause, saying it would still stick to its timeline for implementing the EU AI Act. It went ahead with the August 2, 2025, deadline as planned, and we will update this story if anything changes.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
