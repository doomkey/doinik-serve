            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founder of David Protein, maker of popular high-protein nutrition bars, <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterRahal/status/2018536070183575750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on X on Monday that longevity guru Dr. Peter Attia “has stepped down from his role as Chief Science Officer at David.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement comes after Attia’s name appeared in more than 1,700 documents, including email correspondence, released on Friday as part of a massive file dump related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/well/peter-attia-epstein.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to The New York Times</a>. Attia served on the executive team of the food startup and was also an <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250529749264/en/David-Closes-%2475-Million-Series-A-Funding-Round\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">early investor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those unfamiliar, Attia is a Canadian American physician who has become one of the most prominent voices in longevity and preventive health. He’s best known for his bestselling book “Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity” and his now seven-year-old podcast, wherein he explores optimization strategies. He was also hired just last month as a contributor to CBS.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three-year-old, New York-based David Protein raised a $75 million Series A funding round in May of last year led by Greenoaks, with participation from Valor Equity Partners. The company has experienced significant growth since launching its flagship protein bar in September 2024, a product it describes as having 28 grams of protein, zero sugar, and 150 calories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a lengthy <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterAttiaMD/status/2018350892395774116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on X</a>, Attia wrote that he was “ashamed” of some of the crude content in his emails with Epstein, but he also said he was not involved in criminal activity and never visited Epstein’s island or traveled on his plane. Attia also discussed at length how he came to know Epstein and why he stayed involved with him even after Epstein’s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5478620/jeffrey-epstein-crimes-timeline-legal-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2008 conviction</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fallout appears to extend beyond David Protein. It also appears that Biograph, the healthcare testing and longevity startup that Attia co-founded with entrepreneur John Hering, may be distancing itself from the physician. The company declined to comment on Attia’s ongoing participation with the startup or about the pages on its website that used to mention him but now omit his name or return a “file not found” error.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Biograph came out of stealth a year ago, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/28/startup-co-founded-by-longevity-guru-peter-attia-emerges-from-stealth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch previously reported</a>, with backing from investors that include Vy Capital, Human Capital, Alpha Wave, and WndrCo, along with angel investors, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/19/former-a16z-vc-balaji-srinivasan-obtained-a-private-island-for-his-new-longevity-technocapitalist-school/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Balaji Srinivasan</a>. Like a growing number of concierge medical service companies, Biograph offers premium preventive health services to subscribers who pay between $7,500 and $15,000 per year. Attia was previously named on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.biograph.com/newsroom/biograph-the-worlds-most-advanced-preventive-health-and-diagnostics-clinic-launches-to-redefine-healthy-aging-and-set-new-industry-standards\">company’s press release</a> and site as a co-founder.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Founded in 2022, Varaha has raised about $33 million in equity to date, alongside $35 million in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/kering-backed-fund-mirova-pours-30-5m-into-indias-varaha-for-regenerative-farming-push/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">project financing</a> and $500,000 in grants, as it builds carbon removal projects across Asia and Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has emerged as an increasingly important base for carbon removal projects, offering lower operating costs, deep agricultural supply chains, and a large pool of technical talent as corporate demand for verified removals rises, including from companies facing growing energy use from data centers and AI workloads. Varaha is positioning itself to capitalize on those advantages, arguing that its execution-focused model allows it to deliver carbon removal at lower cost while meeting the same international verification standards as higher-priced competitors in Europe and North America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha’s advantage lies less in proprietary technology and more in execution, said co-founder and chief executive Madhur Jain in an interview, arguing that high operating costs could become a constraint for carbon removal developers in wealthier markets as prices come under pressure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If carbon credit is a cost to the businesses that are buying these carbon credits … it’s a cost on their balance sheet. It’s not a CSR item,” Jain told TechCrunch. “And hence, if the cost of a certain geography is going to be so high by an order of magnitude of like, 1.5x to 3x credit production, it is going to be extremely hard for those companies to survive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha develops carbon removal projects across four main pathways: regenerative agriculture, agroforestry, biochar, and enhanced rock weathering, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/varaha-india-carbon-credits-farmers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working largely with smallholder farmers</a> and industrial partners in emerging markets. The startup generates and sells verified carbon removal credits through international registries, including Puro.earth, Isometric, Verra, Gold Standard, and Switzerland-based Carbon Standards International, positioning itself as a supplier to global corporations seeking durable and independently validated emissions reductions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089092\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/varaha-project.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">One of Varaha’s Regenerative agriculture projects</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Varaha</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, Varaha has removed more than 2 million tons of carbon dioxide across 14 active projects, generating around 150,000 carbon removal credits, Jain said.

The latest funding will be used to expand into additional markets in South and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Indonesia, while deepening its presence in existing geographies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also rolling out an Industrial Partners Program, which allows industrial operators with access to sustainable biomass and gasification capacity to generate verified biochar-based carbon removal credits using Varaha’s measurement, reporting, and verification systems. The program is already operational with partners in West Africa and India, including agribusinesses and a steel producer, as Varaha looks to scale carbon removal through partnerships rather than owning all assets itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The problem is so big that tech, etc., will become open source over a period of time,” Jain said. “So what matters the most is the execution.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha employs about 225 to 230 people, including roughly 55 across technology, science, product and data roles, with more than 80% of its workforce based in India. While the startup does not maintain offices overseas, it has staff in markets including Nepal, Germany, the U.S., and Australia, reflecting its growing international customer base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe Varaha is uniquely positioned to build a global carbon-removal platform from India, combining integrity, scale, and impact,” said Sandeep Singhal, co-founder and managing partner, WestBridge Capital. “This investment reflects our conviction in the team and their potential to shape the next phase of climate infrastructure worldwide.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s part of a grassroots effort, across race and class, that is seeing people speak out, donate money, protest, and offer emotional support to one another. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a lot of commonality between how a teacher is reacting right now and how a tech professional is reacting,” Scott Burns, an investor in the area, told TechCrunch. He said people are “very fatigued.” Burns is going to church more often to help pack food to deliver to those too frightened to leave their homes. “It was like what happens after a natural disaster,” he said of the effort. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Burns and other members of the Minneapolis tech industry told TechCrunch that the immigration raids have been very disruptive to their lives, describing a city that has seen itself united in the last several weeks in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2026/ice-surveillance-immigrants-protesters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">face of escalating violence</a> from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How can building a company remain a focal point when ICE agents appear to be everywhere, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn0w129lqo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plainclothed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/ice-agent-weapons-minneapolis.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">armed with military-grade weapons</a>?

He, too, is a U.S. citizen and can trace his roots in the country back for a century. Still, living just outside the city, he carries his passport with him just in case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where I go to the gym, they’re in rural Minnesota,” he said, meaning agents aren’t only in the city. “It’s just been a strange time.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089255\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258756561.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A demonstrator holding a sign that reads “Stop Minnesota Massacre” while joining a protest.

This investor, for example, works with founders in college, many of whom are immigrants. He buys them food so they don’t have to risk going to the grocery store themselves. He also tries to work from home, when possible, as do many of the other people TechCrunch spoke with. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a tense and difficult time on the ground,” Mary Grove, another investor in the area, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investor Reed Robinson, who has also been helping community members financially, said some of his founders with children have created a volunteer system to watch each other’s kids at school or daycare. It’s so common for ICE to detain the daycare staff, he said, adding that ICE agents <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/ice-violations-judge-statement-twin-cities-texas-immigration/\">frequently violate the law</a> and court orders.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It feels unnecessary, it feels intrusive, it feels like a violation of rights,” Robinson said about the immigration operation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Robinson, many people feel anger beneath the unease and fear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The emotional toll makes it hard to build, investors and founders said. Torres, for example, said his company now has a no-ride-sharing-app policy. Some of his engineers are on H-1B visas <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/startup-founders-say-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-is-a-talent-tariff-that-will-hurt-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(which the Trump administration has also attacked)</a> and have reported being followed by immigration officials.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Each time, it was three to four armed men in tactical outfits,” Torres said, adding that he and his wife have spoken about fleeing the state. “They’re inflicting trauma everywhere they go.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-grassroots-efforts-prevail-as-corporate-leaders-disappoint\">Grassroots efforts prevail as corporate leaders disappoint</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Minneapolis <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/09/minneapolis-investors-mary-grove-justin-kaufenberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tech scene is still quite small</a>, with companies raising just <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-companies-startups-raise-venture-capital-funding-investor/600334061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over $1 billion in the past few years</a>. There are some notable companies in the ecosystem, such as the fintech Sezzle (now public), the clean water company Rorra, and the medtech Reema. There is an incredible history of innovation, Robinson said. “It’s not going to stop; we’re going to continue to do the work while we figure out this current situation.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Twin Cities — Minneapolis and St. Paul — are the headquarters of some of the biggest American companies, such as Target, Optum, Best Buy, UnitedHealthGroup, and General Mills, to name a few. Some founders and investors criticized the leadership of these big companies, mainly for their vague responses to the chaos gripping the cities, even <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/businesses-face-pressure-respond-immigration-enforcement-becoming-target-129567788\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as many of their own employees are detained</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We haven’t had an adequate response,” one startup investor said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sixty top executives from the state <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/business/minnesota-target-general-mills-ceo-letter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed a statement</a> that called for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” after ICE agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Large companies in the state have also come together to fund millions in grants <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-foundation-small-business-grant-immigration-ice-ceo-letter/601571704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">through the Minneapolis Foundation</a> for businesses impacted by the immigration operation. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089257\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257708539.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Protesters hold a vigil for Alex Pretti, the man fatally shot by federal immigration enforcement the previous day in Minneapolis, United States, on January 25, 2026.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Anadolu / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But compared to what is happening on a grassroots level, many founders and investors said these actions are not enough. A recent CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/ice-minneapolis-response-ceos-business.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">poll found that a third of the executives</a> they polled have stayed silent because they didn’t find speaking out relevant to the business. Eighteen percent were worried about “backlash from the Trump administration,” while 9% said they were still figuring out how to respond. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you see the failure of community institutions to demonstrate any kind of bravery, that’s really where it’s probably most disappointing,” Tim Herby, a local investor, told TechCrunch, calling the past two months heart-wrenching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grove, the investor, said her team routinely checks in with others in the community, including her portfolio companies, to ensure they are doing well. She said people are helping each other pay rent, while restaurants are offering free meals. A <a href=\"https://minnestar.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">local tech</a> nonprofit, Minnestar, is set to host a community event to bring people together and discuss next steps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One Black investor said he found it ironic that today, the police are alongside many people in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u13vvXazaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">speaking out against the government</a>, just a few years after people in the city were protesting against them <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/15/minneapolis-st-paul-twin-cities-ice-blm-protest-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">after the murder of George Floyd</a>. It’s a new day-to-day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another Black founder, meanwhile, said some of his white friends have started to drive him around the city for safety. He recalls one day sitting in a restaurant chatting with friends, when the television started giving live updates of <a href=\"https://sahanjournal.com/public-safety/north-minneapolis-ice-shooting-report-immigration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ICE shooting another person</a>. The mood fell somber, a reminder of how these raids have consumed every moment of life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I saw a friend yesterday,” he said. “It was the first time he left the house since New Year’s.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Department of Homeland Security has been quietly demanding tech companies turn over user information about critics of the Trump administration, according to reports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In several cases over recent months, Homeland Security has relied on the use of administrative subpoenas to seek identifiable information about individuals who run anonymous Instagram accounts, which share posts about ICE immigration raids in their local neighborhoods. These subpoenas have also been used to demand information about people who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike judicial subpoenas, which are authorized by a judge after seeing enough evidence of a crime to authorize a search or seizure of someone’s things, administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge’s oversight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While administrative subpoenas cannot be used to obtain the contents of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/reverse-searches-police-tap-tech-companies-private-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">person’s emails, online searches, or location data</a>, they can demand information specifically about the user, such as what time a user logs in, from where, using which devices, and revealing the email addresses and other identifiable information about who opened an online account. But because administrative subpoenas are not backed by a judge’s authority or a court’s order, it’s largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Administrative subpoenas are not new; the use of these self-signed demands by Trump officials to seek identifiable information about people who are critical of the president’s policies has raised alarm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-28/dhs-tried-novel-argument-to-compel-meta-to-provide-user-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported last week</a> that Homeland Security sought the identity of an anonymous Instagram account called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/montcowatch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">@montocowatch</a>, which says its goal is to share resources to help protect immigrant rights and due process across Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. This comes amid an ongoing federal immigration crackdown across the United States, which has drawn widespread protests and condemnation. Homeland Security lawyers sent an administrative subpoena to Meta demanding it turn over personal information of the person who runs the account, citing a non-Homeland Security employee who claimed to receive a tip that ICE agents were being stalked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the account owner, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that recording police, sharing that recording, and doing so anonymously is legal and protected under the First Amendment. Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.aclunorcal.org/press-releases/dhs-withdraws-subpoena-seeking-unmask-instagram-users-who-posted-about-ice-raids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">withdrew its subpoena</a> without providing an explanation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ACLU called the subpoena “part of a broader strategy to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg reported the effort to unmask the @montcowatch account was not an isolated incident, referencing at least four other cases where Homeland Security officials used administrative subpoenas in efforts to identify the people running Instagram accounts publishing content critical of the government. Those subpoenas were also withdrawn after the account owners sued to block the attempt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies have in recent years published transparency reports that detail how many government demands for data they receive. But most do not break out how many judicial and administrative subpoenas they receive over a period of time, even though the two kinds of demands are fundamentally different.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Francis Brennan did not say if Meta provided Homeland Security any data involving @montcowatch or if the company was asked to provide information about the account another way. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new report by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2026/02/03/homeland-security-administrative-subpoena/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post on Tuesday</a> found that an administrative subpoena was also used to seek information from Google about an American retiree within hours of him after sending a critical email to Homeland Security’s lead attorney Joseph Dernbach. The retiree’s home was later visited by federal agents inquiring about the email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post described the retiree as someone critical of Trump during his first term, who attended <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/protestors-voices-no-kings-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a No Kings rally last year</a>, regularly attends gatherings and protests, and wrote criticisms to lawmakers, all actions protected under the First Amendment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within five hours of emailing the Homeland Security lawyer — who was named <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/10/30/trump-asylum-afghanistan-deport-immigration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in an article</a> about the case of an Afghan the U.S. was trying to deport and whose email address is listed on the Florida Bar’s website — the retiree received an email from Google, according to The Washington Post. The email notified him that his account had been subpoenaed by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The subpoena demanded to know the day, time, and duration of all his online sessions, his IP address and physical address, and a list of each service he used, and any other usernames and identifiable information relating to his account, such as his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two weeks later, Homeland Security agents were on his doorstep, asking him questions about the email that he sent to Dernbach, which the agents conceded broke no laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google spokesperson Katelin Jabbari told TechCrunch the company pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, “as we did in this instance,” referring to the subpoena referenced in The Washington Post’s reporting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked by TechCrunch, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin would not say why the U.S. was seeking information about people who have been critical of the Trump administration and accounts documenting ICE activity, or say for what reason the subpoenas were withdrawn.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“HSI has broad administrative subpoena authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d) and 19 U.S.C. § 1509(a)(1) to issue subpoenas,” said McLaughlin, referring to Homeland Security Investigations, an investigative unit within ICE.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not all companies are able to hand over data about their customers. For instance, information that is end-to-end encrypted and can only be accessed by obtaining a person’s phone or devices. That said, many companies are still able to provide large amounts of information about their users, including where they log in, how they log in, and from where, which may allow investigators to unmask anonymous accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">End-to-end encrypted messaging apps, like Signal, have long championed how little data it collects about its users. The messaging app responds to occasional legal demands by stating that it is <a href=\"https://signal.org/bigbrother/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unable to produce user data</a> that it does not have to begin with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reliance on U.S. tech giants is another reason why <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/amid-trump-attacks-and-weaponized-sanctions-europeans-look-to-rely-less-on-us-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">European countries</a> and ordinary consumers are seeking to rely less on American tech giants, at a time when chief executives and senior leaders at some of the largest U.S. tech companies are overtly cozying up to the Trump administration.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup, which was founded in 2016, has raised more than $605 million in equity capital. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089177\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Skyryse-SkyOS-Interior.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Skyryse</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skyryse has made inroads with investors as well as the U.S. military, emergency medical service operators, law enforcement, and private operators for its simplified flight system. The startup has stripped out dozens of mechanical flight controls like gauges and switches and replaced them with a system containing several flight computers that automate the more complicated and dangerous aspects of flying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not a fully autonomous system; a pilot must still handle the operations. But it’s designed to automate the trickiest aspects of flying, enhance the skills of pilots, and improve safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That simplicity and ease of operation — a literal <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/skyryse-brings-in-200m-to-make-flying-an-aircraft-as-simple-as-swiping-a-touchscreen/\">swipe of the finger on a touchscreen</a> — has won over companies like United Rotorcraft, Air Methods, and Mitsubishi Corporation, which have contracts with Skyryse to integrate SkyOS on a variety of helicopters and airplanes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skyryse started building and testing its system on helicopters, one of the most unstable aircraft to operate. But the idea is that SkyOS can be applied to any aircraft. That initial operating system, known as Skyryse One, automates takeoff and landing and fully automates hover and engine-out emergency landings. The company has since integrated the operating system on Black Hawk helicopters.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skyryse has made progress on its certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration.

Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode’s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple’s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089200\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=1200,696 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=1280,742 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=430,249 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=720,417 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=900,522 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=800,464 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=2048,1187 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=668,387 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=647,375 647w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=1064,617 1064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=708,410 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it’s easy to see what’s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what’s happening under the hood. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/events/view/KT5L4XTWKQ/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a “code-along” workshop on Thursday</a> on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real time with their own copy of Xcode.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Built in an era when massive boilers were cutting-edge technology, the buildings are usually too hot or too cold, but seldom just right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are companies trying to rectify that using clever horseshoe-shaped <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/arch-heat-pump-seed-round/\">heat pumps</a>. Superficially, they’re similar to window air conditioners, except they don’t block the view and they can heat as well as cool. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.gradientcomfort.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gradient</a> makes one of those heat pumps, but now it’s adding a twist: In multifamily buildings, it can link every one of its window units together. The startup shared with TechCrunch exclusive details about the new Nexus software and service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Multifamily buildings are an ignored sector,” Vince Romanin, chief technology officer at Gradient, told TechCrunch. “It’s a place where we can do better for the user.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is mostly targeting old buildings that need HVAC upgrades. Gradient has worked with the New York City Housing Authority to install its heat pumps in public housing, and it ran a pilot in Tracy, California, in a newer two-story affordable-housing complex. It’s also talking with colleges and universities, many of which have dorms that weren’t built with hot autumn weather in mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Old buildings often have one electric meter, which can tempt residents into overusing their heating or air conditioning. Nexus gives some control back to building managers. They can set guardrails to prevent people from overusing the heat or AC — either intentionally or otherwise — while still allowing them to be comfortable. In one instance, a building manager set the heating limit at 78˚ F, and the next day energy consumption dropped by a quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Romanin said Gradient’s heat pumps are the “lowest-cost option” for old buildings with boilers that are reaching end of life, a common occurrence in New York City. As a bonus, units that previously only had a steam radiator now get air conditioning, future proofing the units against worsening heat waves. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By installing a window unit rather than a minisplit, retrofits can happen within hours. They also don’t require electrical upgrades, Romanin said. In buildings with old electrical wiring that can’t support a full 12 amp load on a single outlet, Nexus can reduce the draw, said Mansi Shah, senior vice president of product and software at Gradient.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That strategy can extend beyond the building too. When the grid is overwhelmed by demand, which can happen on hot summer days, Gradient is working on a way to dial back its heat pumps while still maintaining occupant comfort. By using information about the building along with feedback from sensors in the heat pumps, the company hopes to predict which units can reduce their air conditioning demand, like those on the shady side of a building. That sort of demand response can help the grid serve more heat pumps without requiring costly upgrades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a lot of people who said when we electrify everything, the grid won’t handle it,” Romanin said. “I think that it is very possible to electrify everything and make the grid better, make the grid’s job easier, and make electrons cheaper.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Given his experience working on social products, he’s also seeking to differentiate Watch Club from existing microdrama apps by embedding a social network within it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think you can actually build such a more interesting business if you take what makes TV truly the most fun,” he said, pointing out “Heated Rivalry” as an example of what he’s talking about. “You watch it, and then you just want to gossip with your three best friends about it, or see what 100,000 funny, clever other young women or gay people on the internet are saying.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, people chat about “Severance” theories on Reddit, or they react to the “Stranger Things” finale on Tumblr. Before Twitter became the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\">cesspool</a> that is X, you had to work hard to avoid “Succession” or “White Lotus” spoilers. Soong sees the potential of housing both the show and the fan forums in one place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How will that app make money? Like most early-stage, venture-funded companies, that’s a question to punt for now, until it’s clear how users are engaging with the app. The answer may be ads, but the idea alone was interesting enough to secure seed funding led by GV. Watch Club also received checks from individuals like Patreon founder and CEO Jack Conte, as well as current and former executives from Hulu, HBO Max, and Meta. Upside Ventures, the firm run by major U.K. YouTubers <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sidemen/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Sidemen</a>, also participated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soong doesn’t have a background in film, which is why he brought in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/devon-albert-stone-4aa3351ba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Devon Albert-Stone</a> as founding producer. He said he plans to hire WGA writers to create a slate of 10 shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We work with brilliantly talented people when they have a few months free to go work on something that may not be huge budget because we offer them huge creative latitude to go do something that Amazon would never let them do at a speed and velocity that feels way more exciting than the glacial pace of the television industry,” Soong said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added: “I’m really good at figuring out how to monetize businesses that seem almost impossible to monetize.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Meta, his mission from 2016 to 2019 was to figure out how to make money in China, a country where no one could use Meta’s products. By 2019, Soong said, Meta generated $5 billion per year of ad sales for companies within China who wanted to advertise to audiences outside of the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chinese ad sales may not be as glamorous as film and TV, but that job gave him additional context to understand the business model behind microdrama apps, which boomed in China at the end of the last decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Right around the time that I was leaving Meta [in 2019] is when these Chinese micro drama apps started spending all this money buying ads on Instagram so that Americans and Germans would download ReelShort and DramaBox,” he said. “I know this business playbook. I know how expensive and capital-intensive it is, and I think you can build a way better microdrama business if you aren’t 100% dependent on paid user acquisition.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Return Offer Season 1 | Official Trailer | Watch Club\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNAjvpyogrQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Watch Club will have its first opportunity to test its concept when it releases its first show, “Return Offer,” which it plans to distribute on its app with daily episodes. On Tuesday, the company shared the first trailer for the show — which is about a group of tech interns in San Francisco competing for a return offer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My goal is to prove that our high-quality stories can give birth to the thing that supplants streaming television, and part of doing that is by building welcoming, creative sets with talented professionals, where people are having fun, despite small budgets, making something wonderful,” Soong said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Tuesday, Lotus announced it raised $35 million in a Series A round co-led by CRV and Kleiner Perkins, bringing its total funding to $41 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People are already consulting AI about their health, but Lotus goes a step further: it moves beyond those chats to facilitate actual medical care, including diagnosis, prescriptions, and specialist referrals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In essence, Lotus is building an AI doctor that functions like a real medical practice, equipped with a license to operate in all 50 states, malpractice insurance, HIPAA-compliant systems, and full access to patient records.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The key difference is that the majority of the work is done by AI, which is trained to ask the same questions a doctor would.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since AI models are also prone to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\">hallucinations</a>, the company always has board-certified human doctors from top health institutions such as Stanford, Harvard, and UCSF review the final diagnoses, lab orders, and medical prescriptions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lotus has developed an AI model that, similar to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/openevidence-the-chatgpt-for-doctors-raises-200m-at-6b-valuation/\">OpenEvidence</a>, synthesizes the latest evidence-based research with a patient’s history and clinical answers to generate a treatment plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is giving the advice, but the real doctors are actually signing off on it,” Dhaliwal told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lotus recognizes the limits of virtual care. For urgent health issues, Lotus directs patients to the nearest urgent care center or emergency room. And if a case requires a physical examination, the platform refers the patient to an in-person physician, Dhaliwal said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outsourcing such a significant portion of medical decision-making to AI is an ambitious bet given the regulatory hurdles in healthcare. For instance, physicians are restricted to seeing patients only in the states where they hold a license.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As CRV general partner Saar Gur, who led the deal and joined the company’s board, put it: “There are many challenges, but it’s not SpaceX sending astronauts to the moon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gur (pictured right), an early investor in DoorDash, Mercury, and Ring, is convinced that the telemedicine frameworks established during the pandemic, combined with recent breakthroughs in AI, allow Lotus to navigate many of the existing regulatory and engineering hurdles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a big swing,” Gur said. But for an investor like Gur, that’s the draw: Lotus is attempting to fundamentally reimagine the entire primary care model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At a time when primary care doctors are in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-025-09575-7#:~:text=The%20first%2C%20by%20the%20Health,present%20and%20increasing%20physician%20shortages.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">short supply</a>, Lotus claims it can see 10 times as many patients as a traditional practice, even when it limits each visit to 15 minutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup isn’t the only one building an AI doctor. Lightspeed-backed <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/doctronic-secures-20m-scale-ai-doctor-platform\" target=\"_blank\">Doctronic</a> is one of the competitors. Lotus is differentiating itself <span>—</span> at least for now — by offering its entire suite of care completely free of charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dhaliwal said that eventual business models may include sponsored content or subscriptions, but the current focus remains entirely on product development and attracting patients rather than revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As immigration enforcement has grown more extreme — even <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2026/01/23/us/liam-conejo-ramos-ice-wwk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">detaining school children</a> seeking legal asylum — tech workers have called on their leaders to speak up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech industry has always been entwined in politics. Companies like Palantir, Clearview AI, Flock, and Paragon are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/\">contracted by</a> U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and assist in the agency’s crackdowns. But as President Trump took office last year, his industry connections have grown. Elon Musk ran a government agency for months, and prolific Silicon Valley investor David Sacks is leading an advisory board on technology for the president. The CEOs behind some of the largest companies in the country — like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Google’s Sundar Pichai — had prime seats at Trump’s inauguration and have remained allied with him. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know our industry leaders have leverage: in October, they persuaded Trump to call off a planned ICE surge in San Francisco,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\">ICEout.tech</a>, a group of tech industry workers opposing ICE, wrote in a statement on January 24, the day of ICU nurse <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy/868567/alex-pretti-minneapolis-childhood-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alex Pretti</a>’s death. “Big tech CEOs are in the White House tonight,” the statement added, referring to a screening of a documentary about Melania Trump where <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/27/apple-tim-cook-trump-alex-pretti/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cook</a>, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, and Zoom’s Eric Yuan were in attendance. “Now they need to go further, and join us in demanding ICE out of all of our cities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of tech’s biggest players have since spoken out, to mixed reception from their employees and the industry. Below, we are keeping an ongoing list of what tech leaders have had to say.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-reid-hoffman-co-founder-of-linkedin\">Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, published an <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/opinion/2026/01/29/reid-hoffman-silicon-valley-can-t-neutral-any-longer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">editorial</a> in the San Francisco Standard on January 29, calling on Silicon Valley to stop trying to be neutral in the wake of the Minnesota killings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We in Silicon Valley can’t bend the knee to Trump,” Hoffman wrote. “We can’t shrink away and just hope the crisis will fade. We know now that hope without action is not a strategy — it’s an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said he’s been encouraged to see more tech leaders speaking out, saying: “it’s a good start to something America needs much more of right now.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whichever candidates you may have supported in the past — or even if (like many of my friends in Silicon Valley) you don’t usually do politics — you almost surely did not want <em>this</em>,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sam-altman-ceo-at-openai\">Sam Altman, CEO at OpenAI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/sam-altman-once-called-trump-115006304.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">publicly opposed</a> Trump’s policies during his first term, but has changed his tune in the new administration as his company has struck deals to develop AI infrastructure for the U.S. government, including the gargantuan $500 billion <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">Stargate project</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the days following Pretti’s death, Altman addressed OpenAI staff in an internal Slack message, which was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/business/dealbook/altman-openai-minnesota.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported by</a> The New York Times.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s happening with ICE is going too far.

But we are going to continue to try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best as we can.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dario-amodei-ceo-at-anthropic\">Dario Amodei, CEO at Anthropic</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an NBC interview, anchor Tom Llamas <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYSC2rU9-Fs&amp;t=2826s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asked Dario Amodei</a> about his views on defense in relation to current events. The anchor pointed out that Anthropic has a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, and that it has partnered with Palantir — which has supplied technology to ICE — on projects for that agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, Amodei reaffirmed that Anthropic does not have any contracts with ICE, despite its relationship with the Defense Department, and emphasized his concern about “the need to protect democracies against autocracies” like China and Russia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m a big believer in, carefully, with guardrails, arming democracies to defend against these countries,” Amodei said, adding that these values persist in the context of internal American politics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to be really careful about making sure democracies are worth defending. We need to defend our own democratic values at home,” he said. “I believe some of the things we’ve seen in the last few days concern me about that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also mentioned ICE’s raids in Minneapolis in a <a href=\"https://x.com/darioamodei/status/2015833051205414955?s=46&amp;t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on X, where he referred to “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tim-cook-ceo-at-apple\">Tim Cook, CEO at Apple</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s CEO addressed staff in an <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/2016341138719076362\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">internal memo</a> on January 27:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a time for deescalation,” Cook said.

To everyone in my industry who’s ever claimed to value freedom—draw on the courage of your convictions and stand up.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an end-to-end-encrypted messaging app, Signal is often used by activists to organize community actions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tony-stubblebine-ceo-at-medium\">Tony Stubblebine, CEO at Medium</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The leader of the online publishing platform Medium, Tony Stubblebine posted screenshots on Threads of a <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@the_coach_life/post/DUG2aMtERX5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">message</a> he shared with staff in which he explains his reasoning for allowing employees to take part in a <a href=\"https://nationalshutdown.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nationwide general strike</a> if they so choose, though he clarified that he is “not in the business of dictating people’s politics.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I started the week in my own head and heart over what I was seeing in Minneapolis and really struggling with the idea that those two murders were just the tip of the iceberg of wrongs,” Stubblebine wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the memo, he writes about the difficulty of navigating his role as a tech CEO during this time, saying that it feels “awkward to navigate being both on-mission and on-money.” He added that he is thinking about the company’s “responsibility to make [its] stance clear, especially as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign and supporting the current administration’s agenda.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stubblebine also pointed out that Medium’s approach to its role as a web publisher reflects the greater values of the company — “for example, that we don’t allow things like hateful content or racist slurs on Medium.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-jeff-dean-chief-scientist-at-google-deepmind\">Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jeff Dean has spoken out about his reaction to the killings in Minnesota.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is absolutely shameful,” Dean <a href=\"https://x.com/JeffDean/status/2015160545331306894\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> on X, responding to a video of federal agents shooting Alex Pretti. “Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera. Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-james-dyett-openai-s-head-of-global-business\">James Dyett, OpenAI’s head of global business</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">James Dyett posted on X about what he sees as hypocrisy in the tech industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,” Dyett <a href=\"https://x.com/dyett/status/2015193525273743447\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a>. “Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-keith-rabois-ethan-choi-and-vinod-khosla-partners-at-khosla-ventures\">Keith Rabois, Ethan Choi, and Vinod Khosla, partners at Khosla Ventures</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois has publicly expressed support for ICE and the Trump administration’s practices, others at the firm have publicly opposed these views.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rabois made incendiary comments on X after border patrol agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, prompting one founder to <a href=\"https://x.com/adam__xyz/status/2015301361974341657\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">respond</a> that that if he were a founder in Khosla Ventures’ portfolio, he would give the money back, calling Rabois “an embarrassment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ethan Choi, another partner at Khosla Ventures, <a href=\"https://x.com/EthanChoi7/status/2015524019085451353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">responded</a> to the post to clarify that not everyone at the firm agrees with Rabois’ views. “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at [Khosla Ventures], at least not mine,” Choi <a href=\"https://x.com/EthanChoi7/status/2015524019085451353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>, adding: “What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinod Khosla, the firm’s founder, reposted Choi’s message and called the federal agents “macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society,” Khosla <a href=\"https://x.com/vkhosla/status/2015647215642186008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>. “ICE personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way. There is politics but humanity should transcend that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khosla also posted on X that he agrees with Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, that more tech executives should speak out against the Trump administration.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The decline, though brief, benefited competing video apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/upscrolleds-founder-says-the-social-network-has-zoomed-past-2-5m-users/\">UpScrolled</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-alternative-skylight-soars-to-380k-users-after-tiktok-u-s-deal-finalized/\">Skylight Social</a>, which saw rapid user adoption as some looked for TikTok alternatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to estimates from digital market intelligence firm <a href=\"http://www.similarweb.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Similarweb</a>, TikTok saw usage dip into the range of 86-88 million daily active users in the U.S. immediately after the ownership change. That compares with a typical average of 92 million daily active users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app has bounced back to more than 90 million daily active users, indicating that many who left TikTok have since returned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TikTok saw a small dip in usage, alternative video-sharing apps UpScrolled and Skylight Social began growing quickly. Although only a tiny fraction of TikTok’s size, UpScrolled topped 138,500 daily active users at its peak on January 28; it has now dropped back down to 68,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Skylight Social hit 81,200 daily active users, according to Similarweb’s estimates and has since dropped to 56,300 daily active users. Overall, Skylight Social saw its user <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-alternative-skylight-soars-to-380k-users-after-tiktok-u-s-deal-finalized/\">sign-ups increase to 380,000</a> as of late January, the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089093\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png 897w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=430,267 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=720,446 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=800,496 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=668,414 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=605,375 605w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=708,439 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Similarweb</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok’s usage decline, which prompted some to try the new apps, wasn’t driven by the ownership change directly, but rather by how users feared it would impact their TikTok experience. There were growing concerns about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok’s updated privacy policy</a>, which gave the app permission to track users’ precise GPS location. (This addition could be related to <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/tiktok-nearby-discover-whats-happening-around-you?lang=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok’s tests of a “Nearby” feed</a> to show users videos from local creators, but was added to the policy alongside the change in ownership, leading to user backlash over privacy concerns.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reading the privacy policy anew, some users also discovered disturbing language, like how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\">TikTok said it may collect users’ “immigration status</a>,” among other personal data. However, this turned out to be a reference that was included because of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which requires businesses to inform consumers if they collect certain sensitive data. TikTok does that — in the sense that anything someone shares on the platform in their video content technically becomes part of the platform, so it requires disclosure. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, TikTok experienced an unfortunately timed, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/\">multi-day data center outage</a>, which caused the app to not function properly, sometimes breaking search, likes, and comments, causing video glitches, disrupting the algorithm, and creating issues with the in-app chat. Users believed these glitches meant TikTok was now censoring their content, which sent them looking for alternatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2018090603582554366\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Sunday evening that the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/tiktok-says-its-services-are-restored-after-the-outage/\">data center outage was resolved</a>, chalking it up to a winter-storm-driven power outage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As users made peace with the new terms and conditions and the outage-driven issues were resolved, users returned to the platform, Similarweb’s data shows. But there’s still hope for the newcomers, as the firm notes that TikTok’s usage has been slowly declining over the latter part of 2025, when usage peaked at 100 million daily active users from July to October 2025, compared with the 90+ million seen now.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving.

PayPal’s CFO and COO, Jamie Miller, will take over as interim CEO until Lores joins the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The appointment comes as PayPal on Tuesday reported lower than expected revenue and profit in the fourth quarter, as consumer spending dipped amid a broader cost of living crisis and a softening labor market. The company also forecast a dip in its full-year profit, which surprised investors, as Wall Street had broadly expected the company to forecast growth instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PayPal’s shares were down about 17.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lores, who served as president and CEO of HP for over six years, said that apart from product innovation, PayPal will hold itself accountable for delivering quarterly accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The payments industry is changing faster than ever, driven by new technologies, evolving regulations, an increasingly competitive landscape, and the rapid acceleration of AI that is reshaping commerce daily. PayPal sits at the center of this change, and I look forward to leading the team to accelerate the delivery of new innovations and to shape the future of digital payments and commerce,” Lores said in a statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

These follow other leadership exits over the past year as it pushes ahead with plans to deepen its focus on AI investing and expand its footprint in the U.S., while keeping India as its largest market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest departures stem from an internal disagreement with senior partner Ashish Agrawal (pictured above, left) that led to a mutual decision to part ways, Managing Director Shailendra Singh told TechCrunch. He added that two other partners, Ishaan Mittal (pictured above, right) and Tejeshwi Sharma (pictured above, center), chose to leave alongside him.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh said Peak XV did not want to go into the specifics of the disagreement and was focused on moving forward. “Just out of privacy, and out of, like, trying to be classy about it,” he said. Singh added that such departures were not uncommon at large, multi-stage venture firms and that Peak XV wanted to move on quickly after several years of working together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All board seats held by the departing partners would be transitioned “imminently,” Singh said, noting that the firm already had overlapping representation across several portfolio companies. He said Peak XV was not concerned about continuity, noting that multiple general partners and operating partners were already involved across many of those boards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The departures mark the exit of long-tenured investors from the firm. Agrawal had been with Peak XV for more than 13 years, while Mittal spent over nine years at the firm and Sharma more than seven years, per their LinkedIn profiles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agrawal <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424404165432377344/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in a LinkedIn post that he had decided to “take the entrepreneurial plunge” and was teaming up with Mittal and Sharma to start a new venture capital firm. He described the move as an opportunity to build a new institution with longtime partners and thanked Peak XV’s leadership for what he called a “truly wonderful partnership.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his time at Peak XV, Agrawal led investments across fintech, consumer, and software, including Groww, one of the firm’s most prominent IPO exits in 2025. He also backed multiple early- and growth-stage companies alongside Mittal and Sharma, contributing to Peak XV’s broader portfolio build-out over the past decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agrawal, Mittal, and Sharma did not respond to messages for comments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV has also moved to strengthen its senior leadership from within. The firm on Tuesday promoted Abhishek Mohan to general partner, expanding its investment leadership bench, while Saipriya Sarangan was elevated to chief operating officer, taking charge of firm-wide operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The leadership changes come amid a standout year for Peak XV’s portfolio exits. Five of its companies — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/groww-raises-nearly-750m-in-ipo-as-indias-retail-investing-boom-continues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Groww</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/pine-labs-gets-warm-market-welcome-on-440m-india-ipo-despite-a-valuation-trim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pine Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/meeshos-606m-ipo-pops-as-enthusiasm-for-indias-e-commerce-startups-rises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meesho</a>, <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/wakefit-innovations-shares-list-flat-at-ipo-price-of-rs-195-on-nse-bse/articleshow/125970319.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wakefit</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/capillary-technologies-shares-debut-at-3-discount-to-ipo-price-on-bse-miss-grey-market-estimates-13689199.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Capillary Technologies</a> — went public in November and December 2025, generating roughly ₹300 billion (around $3.33 billion) in unrealized, mark-to-market gains for the firm, in addition to about ₹28 billion (about $310.61 million) in realized gains from share sales during the IPOs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the latest departures, Peak XV has seen a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/two-senior-partners-are-leaving-peak-xv-amid-strategy-shift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">broader churn in its senior ranks</a> over the past 12 months. Last year, long-time investment leaders Harshjit Sethi and Shailesh Lakhani exited the India team, while Abheek Anand and Pieter Kemps departed from the firm’s Southeast Asia operations. The firm has also seen leadership changes across its marketing, policy, and operations teams in recent months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh dismissed a view circulating in the market that many of the partners who drove Peak XV’s largest exits were no longer at the firm, calling the narrative “not statistically true.” He said several of the firm’s most significant outcomes had been led by long-tenured partners who remained at Peak XV, and argued that the firm’s exit track record did not hinge on any single individual.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV currently has seven general partners, along with multiple partners and principals, according to Singh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The VC firm, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/sequoia-rebrands-china-india-and-southeast-asia-units/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">split from Sequoia Capital in 2023</a> and currently manages over $10 billion in capital across 16 funds, has made about 80 investments linked to AI, Singh said, highlighting its push to deepen its focus on AI funding. It is also preparing to open a U.S. office within the next 90 days as it expands its global footprint, per Singh, while continuing to view India as its largest and most important market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh stated the firm believed AI would reshape venture investing more profoundly than previous technology shifts, arguing that successful AI investing required investors with deep technical understanding rather than “generalist” experience. He added that Peak XV was looking to add more AI-native talent, including researchers and engineers with backgrounds in machine learning and large-scale model development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm has invested in more than 400 companies, and its portfolio has seen over 35 initial public offerings and several M&amp;As to date.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The judges repeatedly asked the company how users can meaningfully consent to data-sharing practices in a market where the app is pretty much the default communications platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With more than 500 million users, India is WhatsApp’s largest market and a key growth area for Meta’s advertising business. Judges in the case question the potential commercial value of metadata generated by the platform, and how such data could be monetized across Meta’s wider advertising and AI functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the hearing, Chief Justice Surya Kant said the Supreme Court would not allow Meta and WhatsApp to share even “a single piece of information” while the appeal was pending, arguing that users faced little real choice in accepting WhatsApp’s privacy policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling the messaging service a monopoly in practice, Kant questioned how “a poor woman selling fruits on the street” or a domestic worker could be expected to grasp how their data was being used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other judges also pressed Meta on how user data was analyzed beyond message content. Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the court wanted to examine the commercial value of behavioral data and how it was used for targeted advertising, arguing that even anonymized or siloed information carried economic worth. Government lawyers added that personal data was not only collected but also commercially exploited.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s lawyers said the platform’s messages are end-to-end encrypted and inaccessible even to the company, arguing that the privacy policy in question did not weaken user protections or allow chat content to be used for advertising.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case stems from a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2021 update</a> to WhatsApp’s privacy policy that required users in India to accept broader data-sharing terms with Meta or stop using the service. India’s competition regulator later imposed a ₹2.13 billion (around $23.6 million) penalty, finding that the policy abused WhatsApp’s dominant position in the messaging market. That ruling was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/22/whatsapp-wins-reprieve-in-india-over-user-data-sharing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">upheld</a> on appeal before Meta and WhatsApp moved the Supreme Court to challenge it. Meta’s lawyers told the court the penalty had already been paid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Supreme Court has adjourned the matter until February 9, allowing Meta and WhatsApp to explain their data practices in greater detail. At the suggestion of the competition regulator, the court also agreed to add the IT ministry as a party to the case, widening the scope of the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta declined to comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp has been facing heightened scrutiny over its  data privacy across the world. Authorities in the U.S. have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/us-has-investigated-claims-that-whatsapp-chats-aren-t-private\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">examined claims</a> that WhatsApp chats may not be as private as the company asserts, adding to broader questions about how encrypted messaging platforms handle user data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In India, WhatsApp is also navigating new regulatory constraints, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/14/whatsapps-biggest-market-is-becoming-its-toughest-test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent SIM-binding rules</a> aimed at curbing fraud, which could limit how widely small businesses use the messaging service.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Vema then draws the hydrogen to the surface and sells it to industrial users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To supply the Quebec local market, which is about 100,000 tons per year, you would need 3 square kilometers, which is nothing,” Pierre Levin, CEO of Vema, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vema’s first pilot well will produce several tons of hydrogen per day, and next year, it plans to drill its first commercial well, which will reach 800 meters into the earth. Vema expects to produce hydrogen from the first wells for less than $1 per kilogram, a widely used benchmark for clean hydrogen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most hydrogen today is made by a process known as steam reforming of methane (SMR), in which steam is used to break hydrogen molecules off methane from natural gas. It’s energy intensive, and both the process to make steam and the chemical reaction itself release carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Less polluting sources of hydrogen exist, but they tend to cost more. Hydrogen from SMR costs between 70 cents and $1.60 per kilogram, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-average-levelised-cost-of-hydrogen-production-by-energy-source-and-technology-2019-and-2050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to the IEA. Capturing carbon from SMR can add around 50% to those prices, while the cleanest process, which uses zero carbon electricity to power an electrolyzer, drives costs up several fold.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stimulated geologic hydrogen, or “engineered mineral hydrogen,” as Vema calls it, promises to be one of the cleanest sources of hydrogen, <a href=\"https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Insight-169-Stimulated-Geologic-Hydrogen-Production.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once Vema has refined its techniques, Levin expects it to produce hydrogen for less than 50 cents per kilogram. At that price, Vema’s hydrogen would be cheaper than any other source on the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the rocks that Vema is targeting are widely distributed, Levin said the company will drill wells close to companies that need power, including data centers. California, for example, has some of the largest formations of ophiolite, an iron-rich type of rock that was pushed up from the ocean bottom by plate tectonics. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Vema can deliver hydrogen at the price it’s forecasting, then a quirk of geology could turn California into a mecca for data centers. “You have a ton of data centers who are trying to get some baseline, decarbonized electricity,” Levin said. “We have very strong traction with them.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
