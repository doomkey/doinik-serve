But like many open-source projects, Backstage is a build-it-yourself option.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Israeli startup Port has been gaining big-name customers like GitHub, British Telecom and LG with a proprietary Backstage competitor: a dev tool portal that’s also now been geared to manage AI agents.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Port, founded in 2022, said it raised a fresh $100 million Series C round led by General Atlantic, with participation from Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners and Team8. The round values Port at $800 million and brings its total funding to date to $158 million. This Series C follows the company’s $35 million Series B led by Accel and Bessemer, <a href=\"https://www.port.io/blog/port-raises-35m-for-its-end-to-end-internal-developer-portal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> in May. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of all the industries that LLM-based tech has infiltrated, coding is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">where it has the deepest roots</a>. So, not surprisingly, developers are also on the cutting edge of building and adopting agents that can automate entire repeated processes — work far beyond asking AI to write some code. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the problem here, according to Port co-founder and CEO Zohar Einy, it’s the wild west right now for such devtool agents at companies: finding them, sharing them, ensuring their work follows company standards and so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developers “want to take AI beyond just coding. They want it to resolve incidents, resolve security issues. They want it to take care of the release management,” Einy told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if agents are connected to all kinds of different tools and data sources, if the data is scattered among them, if they have no way to collaborate, and have no corporate standards and guardrails, “it creates chaos,” his product pitch goes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Port therefore offers more than just a catalog of dev and agent tools (although it does offer that). It supplies a layer of orchestration with features that measure agent performance and add a human-in-the-loop, as desired, to approval processes.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A feature called “context lake” defines the data sources, context memory, and guardrails for agents. “It’s where you manage what agents ‘need to know’ to do their job safely and correctly,” Einy explained. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to using Port to catalog agents devs have already created using other tools, they can use Port to create new agents. Plus, Port also offers a few of its own ready-made agents, which can do things like resolving helpdesk tickets and dealing with provisioning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einy describes his product as handling the other 90% of what software programmers do that isn’t writing code. “It gives the engineers a user interface to control the agent, to iterate with the agent, to approve what it does that is not coding, that is all the 90%.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its giant new war chest of cash, big name customers and tier-one VCs, Port looks like an agentic management startup to watch. But to say it faces competition is an understatement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entire category of agentic management and orchestration is flooded with hopefuls, from big tech companies to startups, and they’re all coming at the various new problems in the space from different angles. A few of these include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/open-source-agentic-startup-langchain-hits-1-25b-valuation/\">LangChain</a>, UiPath, Cortex and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "time": "2025-12-11T11:00:00",
            "imgUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Runware-co-founders-Flaviu-Radulescu-l-and-Ioana-Hreninciuc-.png?resize=1200,896",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flaviu Radulesc started Runware in 2023 when he was testing a text-to-image company and realized that, though genAI  tech was powerful, it was slow in generating images. So Radulesc teamed up with Ioana Hreninciuc and launched Runware as a dev tool platform that specializes in generating images, videos, and audio in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has seen much growth since it first launched. It has powered more than 5 billion creations for more than 100,000 developers, the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The product lets developers integrate Runware’s API into their apps and then generate media assets through one interface, so they don’t have to set up any new infrastructure or maintain separate integrations. It has a custom AI inference infrastructure for open-source models, and provides day-zero access (meaning as soon as a model is released, it can run on Runware) and competitive pricing, Hreninciuc, who focuses on operations and GTM, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, the company announced a $50 million Series A in a round led by Dawn Capital. Dawn Capital <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/dawn-capitals-shamillah-bankiya-breaks-down-the-state-of-the-euro-venture-market/\">Partner Shamillah Bankiya</a> is joining the board. Others in the round include Insight Partners and a16z Speedrun. Runware has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/runware-uses-custom-hardware-and-advanced-orchestration-for-fast-ai-inference/\">raised $66 million in funding to date</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hreninciuc said the company remains competitive through its pricing, which is “more-cost effective,” in addition to having a fully unified API. She said the company does this with its Sonic Inference Engine, which runs on custom AI hardware. It also partners with third-party AI cloud providers so that it can reroute workloads automatically in case more memory is needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On the software side, we heavily optimize model loading and offloading, which lets us support over 400,000 models and make any of them available for inference in real time,” she continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups that focus on dev tools for image and video have been a particularly hot market for VC interest lately. Fal.ai, for instance, just raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/fal-nabs-140m-in-fresh-funding-led-by-sequoia-tripling-valuation-to-4-5b/\">$140 million at a $4.5 billion valuation</a>, its second giant raise in a matter of months. Fal.ai focuses on the breadth of model offerings versus customizing for speed. So, Hreninciuc considers her competitors to be general open-source model makers, such as Hugging Face; Replicate, a startup that runs open-source models in apps with just a few lines of code; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/together-lands-102-5m-investment-to-grow-its-cloud-for-training-generative-ai/\">Together AI</a>, a similar genAI model hoster.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies, as Radulescu previously told TechCrunch, sell based on GPU compute time. Runware instead leans toward the model of Stable Diffusion and Flux, offering a more cost-per-image generated so that people can pay for what they need rather than buying a block of compute time. <strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hreninciuc said the fresh capital will be used to keep expanding the company’s infrastructure and it hopes to use its Sonic Inference Engine to power over 2 million models. The big goal is to be the API for all AI — so that any generative AI model can and does run on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re also expanding rapidly into new modalities,” she said, adding that the company is going to expand the current team of around 25 to help make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Hreninciuc hopes Runware continues to “make it possible for applications to scale to millions of users while actually keeping their margins,” she said, adding that it helps make the market more affordable. That “benefits everyone,” she continued. “From the app builders to the end users, and puts powerful AI into more people’s hands globally.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The tender offer is intended to provide some liquidity to its long-term employees, Bansal said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new valuation is a 49% jump from its <a href=\"https://www.harness.io/blog/harness-valuation-soars-to-3-7-billion-with-230-million-in-series-d-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3.7 billion valuation</a> in a $230 million round in April 2022. With this funding, the startup has raised $570 million of equity to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI accelerates code production, it is widening a bottleneck in the far larger “after-code” phase of software development — the testing, security checks, and deployment work that still consumes nearly 70% of engineering time. Harness’s tools help automate this sprawling, error-prone layer, even as enterprises grapple with rising AI code volume and the risks of shipping even a single line of faulty software into production systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bansal is well known among developers for building and selling app performance company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion</a> in 2017. So the post-coding world is an area Bansal knows well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harness uses AI agents to automate functions like testing, verification, security, and governance. It is built on a software delivery knowledge graph that maps code changes, services, deployments, tests, environments, incidents, policies, and costs. The knowledge graph helps differentiate Harness from other AI platforms, Bansal said, because it gives the system a deep understanding of each customer’s software delivery processes and architecture.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This knowledge graph is the context that our AI agents use,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The purpose-built agents draw on that context to generate pipelines that match each customer’s specific policies, architecture and operational requirements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harness also uses an orchestration engine that turns the AI’s recommendations into automated actions, with checks in place to make sure those changes are applied safely.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074986\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=1200,656 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=1280,699 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=430,235 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=720,393 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=900,492 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=800,437 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=1536,839 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=668,365 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=1129,617 1129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=708,387 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Harness</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI is not foolproof, Bansal said the system is designed with human oversight, noting that AI-generated tests or fixes are reviewed by engineers, compliance teams, or auditors before being put into use.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and CloudBees are among the key competitors for Harness. But Harness has plenty of traction, claiming more than 1,000 enterprise customers, including United Airlines, Morningstar, Keller Williams and National Australia Bank. So far, the startup has handled 128 million deployments, 81 million builds, protected 1.2 trillion API calls, and helped customers optimize $1.9 billion in cloud spending over the past year, Bansal touts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco–based company employs over 1,200 people across 14 offices worldwide, including in Europe and the U.K. Around 33% of its workforce is in India, where it has a large engineering team in Bengaluru and a corporate office in Gurugram. Moreover, the Bengaluru site is Harness’s biggest development center outside the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harness plans to use the new funding to expand its R&amp;D efforts, hire “hundreds of engineers” at its Bengaluru office, and build out additional automated testing, deployment, and security capabilities while improving the accuracy of its AI systems. The company also intends to strengthen its U.S. go-to-market operations and significantly expand its presence in international markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It should also be noted that earlier this year, Bansal <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/appdynamics-founder-jyoti-bansal-merges-startups-harness-traceable-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">merged his software observability firm Traceable</a> with Harness, and that move has helped the startup grow its ARR projection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We brought the two companies together because we started to see that DevOps and application security are coming together in a very, very deep way,” said Bansal. “We have seen that turned out to be a very, very successful thesis this year … that’s driving a lot of growth for both of our DevOps and application security set of products.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this raise has allowed some employees to cash out a bit,  Bansal still plans on taking Harness public one day, he said, though he did not share a specific timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s what our goals and plans depend on,” he said of an eventual IPO. “Our business is very, very healthy, very strong, high growth and margins, and it will be a great public company when the timing is right.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a signal of just how critical this work has become as Google pours up to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/google-expects-significant-increase-in-capex-in-2026-execs-say.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$93 billion</a> into capital expenditures by the end of 2025 — a number that parent company Alphabet expects will be a whole lot bigger next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vahdat isn’t new to the game. The computer scientist, who holds a PhD from UC Berkeley and started as a research intern at Xerox PARC back in the early ’90s, has been quietly building Google’s AI backbone for the past 15 years. Before joining Google in 2010 as an engineering fellow and VP, he was an associate professor at Duke University and later a professor and SAIC Chair at UC San Diego. His academic credentials are formidable — with what appears to be around <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r3aWCRUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">395 published papers</a> — and his research has always focused on making computers work more efficiently at massive scale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vahdat already maintains a high profile with Google. Just eight months ago, at Google Cloud Next, he took the stage to unveil the company’s seventh-generation TPU, called Ironwood, in his role as VP and GM of ML, Systems, and Cloud AI. The specs he rattled off at the event were staggering, too: over 9,000 chips per pod delivering 42.5 exaflops of compute — more than 24 times the power of the world’s No. 1 supercomputer at the time, he said. “Demand for AI compute has increased by a factor of 100 million in just eight years,” he told the audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Behind the scenes, as noted by Semafor, Vahdat has been orchestrating the unglamorous and essential work that keeps Google competitive, including those custom TPU chips for AI training and inference that give Google an edge over rivals like OpenAI, as well as the Jupiter network, the super-fast internal network that allows all its servers to talk to each other and move massive amounts of data around. (In a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/speed-scale-reliability-25-years-of-data-center-networking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> late last year, Vahdat said that Jupiter now scales to 13 petabits per second, explaining that’s enough bandwidth to theoretically support a video call for all 8 billion people on Earth simultaneously.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vahdat has also been deeply involved in the ongoing development of the Borg software system, Google’s cluster management system that acts as the brain coordinating all the work happening across its data centers. And he has said he oversaw the development of Axion, Google’s first custom Arm-based general-purpose CPUs designed for data centers, which the company <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unveiled last year</a> and continues to build.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In short, Vahdat is central to Google’s AI story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, in a market where top AI talent commands astronomical compensation and constant recruitment, Google’s decision to elevate Vahdat to the C-suite may also be about retention. When you’ve spent 15 years building someone into a linchpin of your AI strategy, you make sure they stay.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies, Luka, Meta, Nomi AI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI were also included in the letter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter comes as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/the-race-to-regulate-ai-has-sparked-a-federal-vs-state-showdown/\">a fight over AI regulations has been brewing</a> between state and federal government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those safeguards include transparent third-party audits of large language models that look for signs of delusional or sycophantic ideations, as well as new incident reporting procedures designed to notify users when chatbots produce psychologically harmful outputs. Those third parties, which could include academic and civil society groups, should be allowed to “evaluate systems pre-release without retaliation and to publish their findings without prior approval from the company,” the letter states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“GenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused—and has the potential to cause—serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations,” the letter states, pointing to a number of well-publicized incidents over the past year — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/07/seven-more-families-are-now-suing-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-suicides-delusions/\">suicides</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-ai-stein-erik-soelberg-murder-suicide-6b67dbfb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfX0F2icZLVyVm8juM24tvn9WMyILlVGuXVZJtA36Wsfv71gvMTzXglo1QkYrs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6939fefc&amp;gaa_sig=qD2aVPLhLDJ6yZOABEDGfOuMap-04pCgiJaUqTcZJ04UOQficfvHOOPTZ3ui8WocNfCKbo7MEiGaidYx9iwDHA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">murder</a> — in which violence has been linked to excessive AI use, the letter states. “In many of these incidents, the GenAI products generated sycophantic and delusional outputs that either encouraged users’ delusions or assured users that they were not delusional.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AGs also suggest companies treat mental health incidents the same way tech companies handle cybersecurity incidents — with clear and transparent incident reporting policies and procedures. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies should develop and publish “detection and response timelines for sycophantic and delusional outputs,” the letter states. In a similar fashion to how data breaches are currently handled, companies should also “promptly, clearly, and directly notify users if they were exposed to potentially harmful sycophantic or delusional outputs,” the letter says. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another ask is that the companies develop “reasonable and appropriate safety tests” on GenAI models to “ensure the models do not produce potentially harmful sycophantic and delusional outputs.” These tests should be conducted before the models are ever offered to the public, it adds.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch was unable to reach Google, Microsoft, or OpenAI for comment prior to publication.

That’s at least how the company is framing the launch of its new “Promoted Playlists,” a feature that will initially be available to Premium subscribers in New Zealand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature, which is currently available in English only, is still in beta and will evolve before rolling out to other markets, according to Spotify.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new tool allows users to describe what they want to hear in a personalized playlist that reflects the “full arc” of their tastes, according to the company. That means the playlist focuses not only on the songs you like now, but your entire Spotify listening history from day one — something that differentiates the feature from other playlists, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is an evolution from Spotify’s existing AI playlist option, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/07/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists-you-can-build-using-prompts/\">which debuted last year</a>, and also works through written prompts. As with AI playlists, the new Prompted Playlists allow users to request what they want to hear with written instructions. However, they can now write much longer prompts with more specific instructions. That’s because the new AI feature factors in world knowledge, a rep from Spotify explained to TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the ability to go further back in your listening history and schedule how often the playlist refreshes makes it different from Spotify’s other AI playlist offerings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Spotify suggests subscribers can use the new feature to ask for something like, “music from my top artists from the last five years,” then amend the prompt to include a request for “deep cuts I haven’t heard yet.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Prompted-Playlist-GIF-102924.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074890\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another example of a longer prompt, Spotify said you could ask for “high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down” or “music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, you can continue to fine-tune the prompt to make it even more specific, and can set how often you want it to refresh, like daily or weekly. The idea is that users can essentially make their own version of something like Spotify’s flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, but one that’s focused on a type of music, genre, or time period they’d like to track, or their own version of something like Spotify’s genre-focused Daily Mixes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the playlist will include descriptions and context so you know why you’re getting the recommendation. Plus, it will offer a set of prompts to help users get started.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify isn’t the only social app pitching how it’s letting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/instagrams-new-your-algorithm-tool-gives-you-more-control-over-the-reels-you-see/\">users take control of its algorithm</a>. Instagram today also introduced a new feature that lets users control what type of reels they see. Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, also lets users swap out its algorithm for one of their own. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A light aircraft transmitted power using a laser to a ground receiver over a distance of 5 kilometers (3 miles).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors include the Aurelia Institute, Earthrise Ventures, Engine Ventures, EQT Foundation, Lowercarbon Capital, and Prime Movers Lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As space launch costs have declined over the past decade or so, space-based power has gone from pure science fiction to something closer to reality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are still several hurdles to overcome: For one, it’s still significantly cheaper to deploy solar panels here on Earth than to send them into space. And the ability to send power wirelessly from orbit down to our planet’s surface is still in its infancy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies are attempting the same feat. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/space-solar-startup-aetherflux-raises-50m-to-launch-first-space-demo-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Aetherflux</a> is also pursuing a laser-based approach. Others like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/04/wireless-power-company-emrod-beams-550-w-across-an-airbus-warehouse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Emrod</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/orbital-composites-and-virtus-solis-team-up-for-space-based-solar-power-mission/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Orbital Composites/Virtus Solis</a> are developing microwave-based power transmission, which sends energy wirelessly using a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum than Aetherflux and Overview. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microwaves are less sensitive to clouds and humidity than infrared lasers, which can’t transmit in cloudy weather since the suspended water droplets would absorb much of the energy. But because microwave-based systems can’t reuse existing solar farms, they would have to build their own ground stations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To keep costs down, those ground receivers would probably be smaller, so the energy beams would have to be tighter and more powerful. Companies are developing ways to swiftly interrupt the beam to prevent collateral damage to birds and aircraft, but it’s still a concern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overview’s reuse of solar farms would mitigate some of those concerns, though it would still have to convince the public that energy beams from space are safe and won’t stray off target. (<a href=\"https://simcity.fandom.com/wiki/Microwave_(disaster)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Remember SimCity 2000?</a>) The company will also have to ensure its laser system is very efficient; otherwise the benefit of collecting sunlight in space will evaporate as the energy is converted to infrared light and back again.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says that in 2028 it intends to launch a satellite into low Earth orbit — far below the 36,000 kilometers (22,000 miles) at which it ultimately intends to operate. If all goes as planned, it’ll start sending megawatts’ worth of power from geosynchronous orbit in 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If it sounds audacious, it is. Overview isn’t just confronting some promising but potentially unforgiving physics problems but will also be battling grid-scale batteries, which are getting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/energy-storage-industry-set-aggressive-goals-for-2025-and-already-crushed-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cheaper every year</a>, and potentially nuclear fusion.

SpaceX reported the incident to OSHA, and the agency opened a “rapid response investigation,” according to Joanna Hawkins, deputy regional director of public affairs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rapid response investigations typically involve OSHA asking an employer for more information before determining if the agency will perform an on-site inspection. Hawkins said OSHA is still waiting for SpaceX’s response to that request.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the second known crane-related accident at Starbase this year that OSHA is probing. The agency also opened an investigation into a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/06/26/spacex-crane-collapse-in-texas-being-investigated-by-osha.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">crane that collapsed at Starbase in late June</a>. It’s still not known if any workers were injured during that accident; neither SpaceX nor Starbase city officials have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/spacexs-starbase-city-officials-silent-on-crane-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">commented on the collapse</a>, which was caught on livestreamed video by LabPadre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The crane-related accidents are part of a growing list of incidents at the rapidly expanding launch facility in South Texas as CEO Elon Musk has pushed his company to develop massive rockets that can go to the moon and Mars.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-broken-hip-knee-and-tibia\">A broken hip, knee, and tibia</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for Cavazos, a resident of Cameron County, Texas, filed his <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26366547-eduardo-cavazos-v-ccc-group-inc-space-exploration-technologies-corp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lawsuit</a> in November just a few days after the accident. They said he was working as a subcontractor of CCC Group, which was hired by SpaceX to construct concrete walls at the Starbase site. On November 15, a crane operator was lifting a “vertical formwork” — which holds wet concrete in place until it dries — when one of the long metal supports “detached” and landed on him, Cavazos’ lawyers claim in the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26367469-1st-amended-petition-eduardo-cavazos-with-tro-language/\">amended petition</a> filed this week, Cavazos’ lawyers claim another CCC Group employee was operating the crane and was seen using a cell phone around the time of the accident. The operator “recklessly lowered” the formwork, causing it to strike the ground and surprising Cavazos and two other workers. The operator then suddenly lifted the formwork up, according to the complaint, which is when the 1,200-pound support struck Cavazos.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The metal support broke Cavazos’ hip, knee, and tibia, and he suffered other injuries to his neck, head, shoulders, back, and legs. “In all reasonable probability, [Cavazos] has and/or will undergo physical therapy, daily medications, pain management treatment, and/or surgical intervention in an attempt to control the pain caused by the injuries sustained in this incident,” his lawyers wrote in the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cavazos sued both CCC Group and SpaceX for negligence and is seeking unspecified damages. He claims both companies should be held responsible for not verifying the metal support was properly attached, and failing to properly warn workers of this type of hazard on the site, among other alleged safety violations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Representatives for CCC Group and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Cavazos’ lawyers declined to comment beyond the contents of the complaint.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-starbase-s-safety-record\">Starbase’s safety record</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Workers have sustained serious injuries at SpaceX’s Starbase facility for years. In 2023, a Reuters report about the safety of Starbase <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/spacex-musk-safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">uncovered</a> numerous previously unreported injuries, as well as the fact that an employee died at the South Texas site in 2014 when construction began.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Publicly available data shows the site continues to be dangerous in comparison to other SpaceX facilities and those run by its rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/spacex-worker-injury-rates-at-starbase-outpace-industry-rivals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch analysis</a> of OSHA data this past July found Starbase had a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of around 4.27 injuries per 100 workers in 2024. SpaceX’s McGregor, Texas rocket testing facility had a TRIR of 2.48 in 2024, and its Hawthorne, California site measured out at 1.43. The TRIR for aerospace manufacturing as a whole in 2024 was 1.6 injuries per 100 workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Former OSHA chief of staff Debbie Berkowitz told TechCrunch at the time that Starbase’s TRIR “is a red flag that there are serious safety issues that need to be addressed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Transparency at Starbase is difficult, too. Companies are supposed to report serious injuries to OSHA within 24 hours if they involve hospitalizations, amputations, or the loss of an eye. While it appears SpaceX did so in the case of Cavazos, OSHA penalized SpaceX $7,000 in early June for not reporting a different injury at Starbase that fell into one of those categories. SpaceX contested the penalty and the two sides reached an undisclosed settlement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has been building out Starbase for more than a decade, but the company has big plans to expand the facility in the coming years. It’s currently constructing a $250 million, 700,000-square-foot rocket factory called “Gigabay” that it expects to finish by the end of 2026. The company <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1987755769899708433\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has said</a> it could be used to make as many as 1,000 Starship rockets per year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pressure has only been mounting on SpaceX, too. Acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy recently chastised the company for not moving quickly enough to return astronauts to the moon, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875023335891026324\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">after</a> Musk called lunar missions “a distraction” from Mars. Duffy suggested NASA may opt to use rockets from Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin to land people on the moon before China, which is expected to attempt the feat in 2029.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with new information from Cavazos’ amended petition. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It was chosen by the department’s then-DEI office, which has since been disbanded under Rubio amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI directives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The font was chosen in an effort to make documents easier to read for the vision impaired. Sans-serif fonts are those without decorative swirls and lines at the ends of letters. With their cleaner lines and slightly wider letter spacing, they are considered more accessible for people with issues ranging from dyslexia to low vision (although research on how much <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4612630/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the serifs themselves impact readability</a> has been inconclusive).  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubio’s memo has designated Times New Roman as his tenure’s official font, stating it will “restore decorum and professionalism” to documents. Rubio did admit in the memo that Calibri wasn’t the “most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful” example of DEI to his mind’s eye, but he still berated the font for contributing to “the degradation” of the State Department’s official correspondence.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many people across the political spectrum dislike Calibri (according to an informal survey of TechCrunch writers) but all the same, that’s a harsh criticism for a font. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apparently, there were rumblings within the department in 2023 when Calibri was first adopted, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/politics/rubio-state-department-font.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a>. Font choices inspire the same kind of love/hate passions as sports teams. Everyone has their favorites and their rivalries. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Calibri declined to comment to TechCrunch on how woke it actually was, many people would agree that Times New Roman is a particularly old-timey font.

The move will mark the first time YouTube TV breaks up its cable-like channel bundle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new packages will give consumers more flexibility over the content that they want to pay for. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upcoming lineup of bundles includes one dedicated to sports that will include access to all the major broadcasters, as well as sports networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, all of the ESPN networks, as well as ESPN Unlimited.

But Reddit has decided that perhaps it is, actually, a good idea to verify the accounts of public figures in an attempt to mitigate the spread of misinformation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit acknowledges that pseudonymity is a key part of its culture, allowing users to express themselves more openly than they would if their real name was attached to everything they say. But Reddit says that this feature is completely voluntary and opt-in. The verification feature is less so about denoting a special elite status, but making it easier for both ordinary users and subreddit moderators to quickly verify that someone is being truthful about their identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The absence of a checkmark doesn’t mean someone is a fraud, though. Reddit is piloting this feature with a small batch of profiles, and even if the checkmarks get a full rollout, it’s still possible that some famous Redditors won’t get a check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tonyskates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tony Hawk</a>, for example, posts very casually on skateboarding subreddits, simply chatting about his favorite sport with likeminded fans. He’s just like us!

Having a checkmark doesn’t give a user any special privileges. However, users will not be eligible for a checkmark if they are an NSFW profile, or if they primarily engage in NSFW communities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Reddit is manually verifying profiles, but says it will <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/42763717293716-Verified-profiles-on-Reddit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">use a third-party process</a> in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s probably not a coincidence that Reddit is exploring verification at the same time that its co-founder Alexis Ohanian is launching a reboot of the social aggregator, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/heres-your-first-look-at-the-rebooted-digg/\">Digg.</a> Digg’s founders have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/heres-your-first-look-at-the-rebooted-digg/\">expressed concern</a> that the internet is becoming flooded with bots and AI agents, and they want Digg to be a place where people can connect with actual humans. They’ve <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/02/diggs-founders-explain-how-theyre-building-a-site-for-humans-in-the-ai-era/\">said</a> they’re looking into using <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/18/crypto-blockchain-web3-privacy-cryptography-fully-homomorphic-encryption-startup-sunscreen/\">zero-knowledge proofs</a> as a potential way to verify that users are human.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has also been exploring means of verifying people’s humanity online. World, Altman’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/sam-altmans-world-unveils-a-mobile-verification-device/\">human verification project</a>, is expected to release an app this week that also focuses on keeping out bots.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As part of the new AI pilot program, the company will work with publishers to experiment with new features in Google News.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By adding AI-powered article overviews, Google says users will get more context before they click through to read an article. While AI-generated summaries may lead to fewer clicks on news articles, publications participating in the commercial pilot program will receive direct payments from Google, which could make up for the potential decrease in traffic to their sites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI-powered article overviews will only appear on participating publications’ Google News pages, and not anywhere else on Google News or in Search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t the first time that Google has introduced AI summaries for news. In July, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/google-discover-adds-ai-summaries-threatening-publishers-with-further-traffic-declines/\">the company rolled out AI summaries in Discover</a>, the main news feed inside Google’s search app. With this change, users no longer see a single headline from a major publication in the feed. Instead, they see the logos of multiple news publishers in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also experimenting with audio briefings for people who prefer listening to the news rather than reading it, as part of the new pilot program. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says these features will include clear attribution and a link to articles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Google is partnering with organizations such as Estadão, Antara, Yonhap, and The Associated Press to incorporate real-time information and enhance results in the Gemini app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As the way people consume information evolves, we’ll continue to improve our products for people around the world and engage with feedback from stakeholders across the ecosystem,” Google wrote in its blog post. “We’re doing this work in collaboration with websites and creators of all sizes, from major news publishers to new and emerging voices.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074736\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png 2184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=1200,656 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=1280,700 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=430,235 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=720,394 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=900,492 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=800,437 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=1536,840 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=2048,1120 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=668,365 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=1129,617 1129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=708,387 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-10-at-10.59.58-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of Google’s Wednesday announcement, the company said that it’s launching its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/google-will-now-allow-you-define-your-top-sources-for-search-results/\">“Preferred Sources” feature</a> globally after first launching it in the U.S. and India in August.

Starting on January 20, 2026, authors who set their titles as DRM-free will see their books made available in these more open formats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to use Digital Rights Management (DRM), a copyright protection mechanism, is set by the authors when they publish their e-books on Amazon’s platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes these changes won’t impact previously published titles. If authors want to change the status of older titles, they’ll have to log into the Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) author portal and change an option in the settings. (Instructions on how to make that change are on <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/GDDXGH9VR22ACM8U#change-drm-settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon’s KDP support site</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This move may actually incentivize authors to apply DRM to their e-books.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As <a href=\"https://www.kdpcommunity.com/s/question/0D5at00000ZNckNCAT/drm-and-downloads-of-epubs-is-changing?language=en_US&amp;topicId=0TOf4000000XcD2GAK&amp;count=undefined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one author on the KDP Community forums</a>, Leslie Anne Perry, noted, “Previously, I have not enabled DRM on my e-books. My thinking was that I wanted folks to be able to download them to other devices within their own household. However, I think I will enable it on any future e-books. I’m not sure I want people to be able to download them as a PDFs [sic].”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another member pushed back at the complaints, arguing that it doesn’t really increase privacy, as those who had wanted to could always dump the existing DRM-free Kindle file into software to convert it into an EPUB or PDF.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is positioning the new feature as making it “easier” for readers to enjoy the content they’ve already purchased, but the reality is that authors would have to opt in if they want to open up access to their older works. To remove the DRM, authors will have to click a box that says, “I understand that by not applying DRM, customers who buy and have already bought this book will be able to download it as a PDF or EPUB file.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elsewhere, Amazon has been making it more difficult for Kindle owners to share or back up their e-books through heavier use of DRM in recent months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With an update to Kindle’s software for 11th- and 12th-generation devices, the retailer <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-is-making-it-impossible-to-remove-the-drm-from-kindle-books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced a new DRM system</a> that made it impossible for Kindle users to back up their e-books without jailbreaking their device. This had followed an <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-removing-download-and-transfer-on-the-kindle-feb-26th\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earlier change</a> to remove the download and transfer options via USB, which angered many Kindle owners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the author updates their e-book’s DRM status, Amazon says the changes will take up to 72 hours before they are live on Amazon.com.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For the U.S. market, OpenAI’s ChatGPT topped the ranks of free iPhone apps (not including games) with the most installs in 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI app was followed by Threads, Google, TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and Google’s Gemini.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT made it to No. 4 last year, but the top spot was taken by Chinese shopping app Temu. In 2023, the AI app didn’t make the top-10 list despite being released on the iPhone in May 2023 to a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/chatgpts-new-app-comes-out-of-the-gate-hot-tops-half-a-million-installs-in-first-6-days/\">strong</a> debut.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that ChatGPT is outpacing social networking standbys, and much-needed utilities like Google Maps, indicates how deeply AI has penetrated people’s everyday lives here in the U.S. It also demonstrates the potential for OpenAI to disrupt Google’s tight hold on the search market on mobile devices, as more people turn to a chatbot for answers first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were signs that ChatGPT was on its way to No. 1 earlier in the year — it became the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/chatgpt-became-the-most-downloaded-app-globally-in-march/\">most-downloaded app globally in March</a>, outpacing other top apps like TikTok and Instagram.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple also released its list of the top paid apps, the top free and paid games for iPhone and iPad, as well as the top Apple Arcade games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Block Blast! was the top free game this year, while Minecraft took the crown as the top paid game. On iPad, YouTube was the No. 1 free app, and users downloaded the creativity app Procreate as the top paid game on iPad.

The e-commerce giant says it will expand the service to additional cities in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon launched the ability to order perishable items via Same-Day Delivery <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/amazon-rolls-out-same-day-delivery-of-perishable-groceries-in-1000-us-cities/\">in August</a>, a move that was seen as a way for the company to compete more directly with Instacart and Walmart+ in the quick-commerce space.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launch, customers have ordered fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods, and frozen foods alongside electronics, books, pantry staples, and snacks, as well as everyday household essentials like paper towels and toothpaste.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says its “specialized temperature-controlled fulfillment network” ensures that shoppers receive perishable groceries intact, and that orders undergo a six-point quality check upon arrival and before leaving for delivery. Plus, temperature-sensitive products are delivered in insulated bags.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fresh groceries now make up nine of the top 10 most-ordered items for fast delivery, Amazon says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The top bestsellers for Same-Day Delivery are bananas, Haas avocados, strawberries, honeycrisp apples, limes, blueberries, blackberries, organic bananas, navel oranges, and bathroom tissues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also notes that perishable grocery sales have grown 30 times since January, and that customers who add fresh groceries to their Same-Day Delivery orders shop about twice as often as those who don’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Same-day delivery is free for orders worth more than $25 for Prime members. If an order doesn’t meet the minimum amount, subscribers can still choose same-day delivery for a $2.99 fee. For customers without a Prime membership, the service is available with a $12.99 fee, regardless of the order size.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says it has grown its perishable selection available for Same-Day Delivery by over 30% since August, and has included thousands of popular items from Whole Foods Market.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round also saw investments from individuals such as Adam D’Angelo, Garry Tan, Lenny Rachitsky, Mati Staniszewski, Mikey Shulman, Jared Hecht, and M.G. Siegler.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That platform, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/after-selling-to-spotify-anchors-co-founders-are-back-with-oboe-an-ai-powered-app-for-learning/\">which officially launched in September</a>, allows users to define a learning goal and use AI to create a course for them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s fundraise comes three months after the app’s launch and a year after it raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/after-selling-anchor-to-spotify-co-founders-reunite-to-build-ai-educational-startup-oboe/\">a $4 million seed round</a>. Zicherman said the reason behind the fresh round is to fuel growth at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to reach billions of people who want to learn about new topics, and it is a very big opportunity,”  he told TechCrunch over a call. “We need to execute faster and reach a larger audience at scale to achieve this vision.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a team of successful consumer product builders that can execute well, which gives us an edge over other startups in the market,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bryan Kim, a partner at a16z, said that he was impressed by how fast Oboe started generating content on a topic and didn’t make users wait behind a loading indicator. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have had a thesis around how AI-aided learning can help people explore new topics and have been looking for the right company. After Oboe launched, we tried it and loved the product. We wanted to back a founder who was ambitious, flexible in adopting different form factors, and understood AI to build a big platform. We found that in Oboe,” he told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is making changes to its core course-generation experience, as well. Earlier, Oboe generated different text and audio formats for users in different styles. Plus, it capped course generation based on the payment plan.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Image describing screenshots of Oboe's new chapter focused learning course generation.\" class=\"wp-image-3074609\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Oboe</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new version, the app will first understand your goal and then generate chapters based on that to help you learn about those topics.

There is also a $40 per month ($384 per year) Pro plan, which gives unlimited chapter access and allows users to export or download courses for consumption outside Oboe. The startup said this is suitable for students who want to take printouts of the study material and consume it offline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zicherman said that right now Oboe is offering courses in English, but it wants to reach different parts of the world better with localized courses and language support. The platform is currently available on the web, with mobile support planned for the future. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last few years, multiple tools, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/googles-notebooklm-now-lets-you-guide-ai-generated-audio-conversations-launches-business-pilot/\">Google’s NotebookLM</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/former-notebooklm-devs-new-app-huxe-taps-audio-to-help-you-with-news-and-research/\">ex-Google employees’ Huxe</a>, allow you to enter a prompt to get a podcast episode to explore a topic.
