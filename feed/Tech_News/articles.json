Amagi was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/general-atlantic-values-media-tech-amagi-at-1-4-billion-in-new-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last valued at $1.4 billion</a> in a private funding round in November 2022, after a $100 million raise led by General Atlantic, and investors sought to buy <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=AMAGI&amp;series=EQ&amp;type=Past\">more than 30 times</a> the available shares.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-headquartered company sells cloud software that helps TV networks and streaming services distribute and monetize video, and earns almost all of its revenue outside India — including around 73% from the U.S. and about 20% from Europe — CEO and co-founder Baskar Subramanian said in an interview, making it a rare export-first technology listing on Indian exchanges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $196 million IPO included a fresh issue of shares worth ₹8.16 billion (about $89.33 million), while existing investors sold about 26.9 million shares through an offer-for-sale. The deal was smaller than Amagi’s earlier plan, after the company trimmed the fresh issue and reduced the number of shares to be sold by existing backers from 34.2 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Norwest Venture Partners, Accel, and Premji Invest were among Amagi’s existing shareholders who sold shares in the IPO. Subramanian told TechCrunch the sales were only a “very small portion” of holdings, and said the company’s founders were not selling a single share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For us as an event, it’s a pit stop in a long journey,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accel has particularly retained close to a 10% stake in Amagi after the IPO, even as the listing locks in a roughly 3.3x gain on shares it acquired at around ₹108 per share. “To make the IPO, we are reluctantly exiting as little as possible to make this happen,” said Shekhar Kirani, an Accel partner.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2008 by Subramanian, Srividhya Srinivasan, and Arunachalam Srinivasan Karapattu, Amagi counts content companies such as Lionsgate Studios, Fox, and Sinclair Broadcast Group among its clients, as well as distributors including Roku, Vizio, Rakuten TV, and DirecTV, and advertising platforms such as The Trade Desk and Index Exchange.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subramanian said Amagi is riding a shift as broadcasters and streamers move away from “big iron” hardware and satellite-based workflows toward cloud-based operations, arguing that only a small portion of the industry has completed the transition so far. The company has also begun pitching new automation and AI-driven tools to help media companies cut labor-heavy operating costs, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s revenue from operations rose 34.6% year-over-year to ₹7.05 billion (around $77.18 million) in the six months ended September 30, 2025, while net revenue retention was about 127% — meaning existing customers increased their spending by 27%, per its <a href=\"https://www.amagi.com/hubfs/Project%20Chrysalis%20-%20RHP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prospectus</a> (PDF).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi is betting that broadcast and live video are still in the early stages of moving to the cloud, Subramanian told TechCrunch, estimating that less than 10% of the industry has made the shift, leaving a long runway as media groups modernise infrastructure and expand ad-supported streaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s appeal lies in being a “premium” and highly reliable platform for blue-chip customers, said Rachit Parekh, a partner at Accel, arguing that downtime during major live events can be highly costly for broadcasters and streamers. This dynamic has helped drive high customer retention and expansion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, Amagi is also competing against legacy broadcast vendors that are racing to modernize their own offerings for the cloud, while its push into AI-driven automation will test whether Amagi can expand beyond infrastructure into software with better profit margins without rising cloud costs eating into profitability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi said it plans to plow most of the fresh proceeds into technology and cloud infrastructure, allocating ₹5.50 billion ($60.21 million) for that purpose, while also setting aside funds for potential acquisitions and general corporate use, per its prospectus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi’s debut comes as India’s IPO market has drawn a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/softbank-stays-in-as-meesho-606m-ipo-becomes-indias-first-major-e-commerce-listing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rising number of technology-led listings</a>, supported by strong domestic investor demand even as late-stage startup funding remains subdued. The shift has positioned public markets as both a growth-financing option and a path to exits for early backers, a dynamic that has become more visible as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/27/india-startup-funding-hits-11b-in-2025-as-investors-grow-more-selective/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">private capital has turned more selective</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s tech sector <a href=\"https://w.tracxn.com/report-releases/india-tech-annual-funding-report-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recorded 42 IPOs in 2025</a>, up from 36 in 2024, per market intelligence firm Tracxn. Several venture-backed startups, including consumer and fintech firms, are also widely expected to test public markets in 2026 as the pipeline builds.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Voice is a popular medium for communication among people and businesses in India. That’s why enterprises and startups are eager to use voice AI to be more efficient at customer support, sales, customer acquisition, hiring, and training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But recognizing market demand is one thing — proving businesses will pay is another. Y Combinator rejected the application from <a href=\"https://www.bolna.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bolna</a>, a voice orchestration startup built by Maitreya Wagh and Prateek Sachan, five times before finally accepting it into the fall 2025 batch, skeptical that the founders could turn interest into revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we were applying for Y Combinator, the feedback we got was, ‘great to see that you have a product that can create realistic voice agents, but Indian enterprises are not going to pay, and you are not going to make money out of this,’” Wagh told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup applied with the same idea for the fall batch but was able to show it had revenue of more than $25,000 coming in every month for the last few months. At that time, the company was running $100 pilots to help users build voice agents. Now the startup is pricing those pilots at $500.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The momentum has continued. The startup said on Tuesday that it has raised a $6.3 million seed round led by General Catalyst, with participation from Y Combinator, Blume Ventures, Orange Collective, Pioneer Fund, Transpose Capital, and Eight Capital. The round also includes individual investors, including Aarthi Ramamurthy, Arpan Sheth, Sriwatsan Krishnan, Ravi Iyer, and Taro Fukuyama.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-product-and-customers\">The product and customers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bolna is building an orchestration layer — essentially a platform that connects and manages different AI voice technologies — akin to startups like Vapi, LiveKit, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/voicerun-nabs-5-5m-to-build-voice-agent-factory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VoiceRun</a>, to suit the idiosyncrasies of interactions in India, including noise cancellation, getting verification on the caller ID platform Truecaller, and handling mixed languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Feature-wise, the company has built specific nuances for Indian users, such as speaking numbers in English regardless of the core language, or allowing for keypad input for longer inputs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083843\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg 2940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1200,682 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1280,728 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=720,409 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=900,512 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=800,455 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=668,380 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=659,375 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1085,617 1085w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=708,403 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bolna</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wagh noted that the key differentiation of Bolna is that it makes it easy for users to build voice agents by just describing them, even if they don’t know much about the underlying technology, and start using them for calls. The company said that 75% of its revenue is coming from self-serve customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also said that because Bolna is an orchestration layer, it doesn’t depend on a single model, so enterprises can easily switch when there is a better model available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our platform allows customers to switch models easily or even use different models for different locales to get the best out of them. An orchestration layer is necessary for enterprises to ensure they are getting the best models because one model can be better today and another one can be better tomorrow,” Wagh said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has a range of clients, including car reselling platform Spinny, on-demand house-help startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/indias-snabbit-valuation-doubled-to-180m-in-5-months-on-its-quick-house-help-bet/\">Snabbit</a>, beverage companies, and dating apps. Most of these are small to midsize businesses that use Bolna’s self-serve platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Separately, Bolna is pursuing large enterprise deals. For these large enterprises and custom implementations, Bolna has a team of forward-deployed engineers — specialists who work directly with clients on-site or closely with their teams. The startup has signed two large enterprises as paying customers and has four more in the pilot stage. Currently, Bolna employs nine forward-deployed engineers and is adding two to three people to that team every month to support this enterprise push.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bolna has seen steady growth in both call volumes and revenue. It say it’s now handling over 200,000 calls per day and on the verge of crossing $700,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company noted that while 60% to 70% of call volume is in English or Hindi, other regional languages are steadily rising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Akarsh Shrivastava, who is part of the investment team at General Catalyst, said that the firm found Bolna impressive because its orchestration layer is flexible for various kinds of customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bolna allows you the freedom to choose any model and has a stack behind it to mold it according to your requirement. It’s a good option for people who want to own some part of the stack, want flexibility in model picking, and want to be able to maintain those products themselves,” Shrivastava told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Maybe they aren’t these chipmakers’ shiniest, most advanced chips, but they’re high-performance processors used for AI, making the export controversial. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2026-01-20/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-on-the-future-of-ai-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unloaded</a> on both the administration and the chip companies over the decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The criticism was particularly notable because one of those chipmakers, Nvidia, is a major partner and investor in Anthropic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The CEOs of these companies say, ‘It’s the embargo on chips that’s holding us back,’” Amodei  said, incredulous, in response to a question about the new rules. The decision is going to come back to bite the U.S., he warned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are many years ahead of China in terms of our ability to make chips,” he told Bloomberg’s editor-in-chief, who was interviewing him. “So I think it would be a big mistake to ship these chips.” Amodei then painted an alarming picture of what’s at stake. He talked about the “incredible national security implications” of AI models that represent “essentially cognition, that are essentially intelligence.” He likened future AI to a “country of geniuses in a data center,” saying to imagine “100 million people smarter than any Nobel Prize winner,” all under the control of one country or another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The image underscored why he thinks chip exports matter so much. But then came the biggest blow. “I think this is crazy,” Amodei said of the administration’s latest move. “It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sound you hear? The team at Nvidia, screaming into their phones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia isn’t just another chip company. While Anthropic runs on the servers of Microsoft and Amazon and Google, Nvidia alone supplies the GPUs that power Anthropic’s AI models (every cloud provider needs Nvidia’s GPUs). Not only does Nvidia sit at the center of everything, but it also recently announced it was investing in Anthropic to the tune of up to $10 billion.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just two months ago, the companies <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-nvidia-anthropic-announce-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced that financial relationship</a>, along with a “deep technology partnership” with cheery promises to optimize each other’s technology. Fast-forward to Davos, and Amodei is comparing his partner to an arms dealer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Maybe it was just an unguarded moment — it’s possible he got swept up in his own rhetoric and blurted out the analogy. But given Anthropic’s strong position in the AI market, it seems more likely he felt comfortable speaking with confidence. The company has raised billions, is valued in the hundreds of billions, and its Claude coding assistant has developed a reputation as a highly beloved and top-tier AI coding tool, particularly among developers working on complex, real-world projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also entirely possible that Anthropic genuinely fears Chinese AI labs and wants Washington to act. If you want to get someone’s attention, nuclear proliferation comparisons are probably a pretty effective way to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s perhaps most remarkable is that Amodei could sit onstage at Davos, drop a bomb like that, and walk away to some other gathering without fear that he just adversely impacted his business. News cycles move on, sure. Anthropic is also on solid footing right now. But it does feel that the AI race has grown so existential in the minds of its leaders that the usual constraints — investor relations, strategic partnerships, diplomatic niceties — don’t apply anymore. Amodei isn’t concerned about what he can and can’t say. More than anything else he said on that stage, that fearlessness is worth paying attention to.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the company announced plans to revamp its mobile app and expand its short-form video feature, which it mentions could help promote the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/netflixs-first-original-video-podcasts-feature-pete-davidson-and-michael-irvin/\">new slate of original video podcasts</a> it unveiled last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Set to launch later in 2026, Netflix’s redesigned mobile app is intended to “better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come,” according to co-CEO Greg Peters. The update will act as a foundation for ongoing experimentation, allowing the company to “iterate, test, evolve, and improve” its offering over time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the center of the redesign is deeper integration of vertical video feeds, which the streaming giant has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-is-getting-into-short-videos-with-a-new-vertical-feed-for-mobile/\">experimenting</a> with since May. The feed displays short clips from Netflix shows and movies in a format familiar to TikTok and Instagram Reels users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can imagine us bringing more clips based on new content types, like video podcasts,” Peters remarked during the earnings call, further signaling that Netflix sees swipeable short-form clips as a powerful tool for capturing attention and increasing time spent in the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix is also making a significant push into video podcasts — a sector where YouTube has long been the leader. This week, Netflix debuted its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/netflixs-first-original-video-podcasts-feature-pete-davidson-and-michael-irvin/\">first original video podcasts</a>, including shows hosted by high-profile personalities such as Pete Davidson and Michael Irvin. The company has also partnered with major podcast players to bring established video podcast libraries to the platform, including tie-ups with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/netflix-doubles-down-on-video-podcasts-with-iheartmedia-deal/\">iHeartMedia</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both of these moves signal a broader effort to make content discovery and daily engagement on Netflix feel more like a social platform experience. At the same time, Netflix has been careful to position its strategy as experimentation rather than imitation. Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/netflix-cto-says-more-vertical-video-experiments-are-coming-but-streamer-is-not-competing-with-tiktok/\">CTO Elizabeth Stone</a> emphasized that the company isn’t trying to become TikTok, but rather to strengthen its entertainment discovery capabilities through mobile-first features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the earnings call, co-CEO Ted Sarandos reflected on the wider shift in the streaming industry: services are no longer competing only with one another, but with the entire entertainment industry. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s never been more competition for creators, for consumer attention, for advertising and subscription dollars, the competitive lines around TV consumption are already blurring,” Sarandos said. “TV is not what we grew up on. TV is now just about everything. The Oscars and the NFL are on YouTube…Apple’s competing for Emmys and Oscars, and Instagram is coming next.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarandos also commented on Netflix’s evolving film strategy, referencing the company’s recent shift in its theatrical release strategy as it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-in-a-disruptive-deal-valued-at-82-7b/\">prepares to acquire Warner Bros</a>. This signals an openness to hybrid distribution models, as the line between cinema, streaming, and social content continues to blur.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, Netflix delivered $45.2 billion in revenue, with ad revenue rising to over $1.5 billion. Additionally, Netflix crossed the 325 million paid subscriptions milestone in the fourth quarter. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Should investor interest be high, it could wind up pricing higher. That means a bigger valuation and more money raised.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, which offers software to sell life insurance, is backed by Sequoia, Accel, Alphabet’s venture capital arm GV, SoftBank, General Catalyst, and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel are not selling shares in the IPO, the company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788451/000119312526015943/d901135ds1a.htm#rom901135_18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ethos was a rising startup star in the pre-AI era, raising one big round after another through 2021.

A number of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/openai-denies-allegation-chatgpt-teenagers-death-adam-raine-lawsuit-rcna245946\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">teen suicides</a> have been linked to the chatbot, and, like other AI vendors, OpenAI has also been criticized for allowing ChatGPT to discuss sexual topics with young users. Last April, the company was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/openai-is-fixing-a-bug-that-allowed-minors-to-generate-erotic-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">forced to address a bug</a> that allowed its chatbot to generate erotica for users who were under the age of 18.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has already been working on its underage user problem for some time, and its new “age prediction” feature merely adds to protections already in place. The new feature leverages an AI algorithm that assesses user accounts for particular “behavioral and account-level signals,” in an effort to identify young users, OpenAI said <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-age-prediction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a blog post</a> Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those “signals” include things like the user’s stated age, the length of time an account has existed, and the times of day that the account is usually active, the company said. The company already has content filters designed to weed out discussions of sex, violence, and other potentially problematic topics for users who are under age 18. If the age prediction mechanism identifies an account as under 18, those filters are automatically applied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If a user is mistakenly designated as underage, there is a way for them to reestablish their “adult” account. They can submit a selfie to OpenAI’s ID verification partner Persona, OpenAI says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Only this time, Dojo3 won’t be aimed at training self-driving models on Earth. Instead, Musk says it will be dedicated to “space-based AI compute.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes five months after Tesla effectively shut down its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/tesla-dojo-the-rise-and-fall-of-elon-musks-ai-supercomputer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dojo effort</a>. The company disbanded the team behind its Dojo supercomputer following the departure of Dojo lead Peter Bannon. Around 20 Dojo workers also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-06/former-tesla-executives-start-automotive-ai-company-densityai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">left to join DensityAI</a>, a new AI infrastructure startup founded by former Dojo head <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/\">Ganesh Venkataramanan</a> and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of Dojo’s shutdown, Bloomberg reported Tesla planned to increase its reliance on Nvidia and other partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing, rather than continue developing its own custom silicon. Musk’s latest comments suggest the strategy has shifted again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The billionaire executive and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/elon-musk-10-million-campaign-donation-kentucky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Republican megadonor</a> said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2013034224828215706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2013034224828215706%7Ctwgr%5E6cb7f7eaf7efe5568175be7fbcf4cf4c874e9a7f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Ftesla-confirms-that-work-on-dojo-3-has-officially-resumed%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on X</a> the decision to revive Dojo was based on the state of its in-house chip roadmap, noting that Tesla’s AI5 chip design was “in good shape.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s AI5 chip, made by TSMC, was designed to power the automaker’s automated driving features and Optimus humanoid robots. Last summer, Tesla signed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/tesla-signs-16-5b-deal-with-samsung-to-make-ai-chips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$16.5 billion deal with Samsung</a> to build its AI6 chips that promise to power Tesla vehicles and Optimus, as well as enable high-performance AI training in data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI7/Dojo3 will be for space-based AI compute,” Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2012756384559817033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2012756384559817033%7Ctwgr%5E6cb7f7eaf7efe5568175be7fbcf4cf4c874e9a7f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Ftesla-confirms-that-work-on-dojo-3-has-officially-resumed%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> on Sunday, positioning the resurrected project as more of a moonshot. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To achieve that, Tesla is now gearing up to rebuild the team it dismantled months ago. Musk used the same post to recruit engineers directly, writing: “If you’re interested in working on what will be the highest volume chips in the world, send a note to AI_Chips@Tesla.com with 3 bullet points on the toughest technical problems you’ve solved.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of the announcement is notable. At CES 2026, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-launches-alpamayo-open-ai-models-that-allow-autonomous-vehicles-to-think-like-a-human/?_thumbnail_id=3079884\">Nvidia unveiled </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-launches-alpamayo-open-ai-models-that-allow-autonomous-vehicles-to-think-like-a-human/?_thumbnail_id=3079884\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alpamayo</a>, an open source AI model for autonomous driving that directly challenges Tesla’s FSD software. Musk commented on X that solving the long tail of rare edge cases in driving is “super hard,” adding: “I honestly hope they succeed.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk and several other AI executives have argued the future of data centers may lie off-planet, since Earth’s power grids are already strained to the max. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/ai-spacex-elon-musk-data-centers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios recently reported</a> Musk rival and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also excited by the prospect of putting data centers into orbit. Musk has an edge over his peers because he already controls the launch vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per Axios, Musk plans to use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/spacex-reportedly-planning-2026-ipo-with-1-5t-valuation-target/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SpaceX’s upcoming IPO</a> to help finance his vision of using Starship to launch a constellation of compute satellites that can operate in constant sunlight, harvesting solar power 24/7. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, there are many roadblocks to making AI data centers in space a possibility, not least the challenge of cooling high-power compute in a vacuum. Musk’s comments of Tesla building “space-based AI compute” fit a familiar pattern: float an idea that sounds far-fetched, then try to brute-force it into reality. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The GitHub write-up released Tuesday notes that the system “relies entirely” on the company’s “Grok-based transformer” to “learn relevance from user engagement sequences.” In other words, Grok is looking at what you’re clicking and liking and feeding that information into the recommendation system. The write-up also notes that there is no “manual feature engineering for content relevance,” meaning humans don’t manually adjust how the algorithm determines what’s relevant. It adds that the automation “significantly reduces the complexity in our data pipelines and serving infrastructure.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why is X revealing all of this now? It’s not totally clear. In the past, Musk has claimed that he wants to make the platform an exemplar of corporate transparency — a theme that continues to today. In 2023, when the Twitter algorithm was first revealed, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1636838845894279168\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said that</a> providing “code transparency” would be “incredibly embarrassing at first” but would ultimately “lead to rapid improvement in recommendation quality.” He added: “Most importantly, we hope to earn your trust.” With its first code open sourcing, the platform proclaimed a “<a href=\"https://blog.x.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/a-new-era-of-transparency-for-twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new era of transparency</a>” for Twitter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Musk has talked transparency, certain aspects of the platform have arguably grown less open since Musk took it over. When the tech billionaire bought Twitter in 2022, the site was notably forced to transition from a public company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/technology/twitter-changes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to a private one</a> — an evolution that isn’t typically synonymous with openness. While the site used to release <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/x-twitter-first-transparency-report-since-elon-musks-takeover-is-finally-here/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">multiple transparency reports a year</a>, X didn’t release its <a href=\"https://transparency.x.com/content/dam/transparency-twitter/2024/x-global-transparency-report-h1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first transparency report</a> until September of 2024. In December, X was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-fine-x-120-million-euro-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also fined $140 million</a> by European Union regulators who claimed that the site had violated “transparency obligations” under the Digital Services Act (DSA), and argued that the site’s verification check mark system had made it more difficult for users to judge the authenticity of particular accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X has also been under pressure over the past month due to the ways in which its chatbot, Grok, have been used to create and distribute sexualized content. The California Attorney General’s office and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/us-senators-demand-answers-from-x-meta-alphabet-on-sexualized-deepfakes/\">congressional lawmakers</a> have both scrutinized the platform in recent weeks, citing claims that Grok has been used to create naked images of women and minors. As a result, some may view this appeal to openness <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/860294/elon-musk-open-source-x-algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as just more theater</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Russell had argued he was unwilling to turn over his phone until he received assurances from Luminar that his personal information would be protected; the Tuesday filing shows the two sides agreed to hash out exact steps on how that information will be handled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar filed for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> in December after losing major contracts with customers like Volvo and Mercedes-Benz, as well as rising competition from lidar companies in China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar reached a deal last week with a company called Quantum Computing Inc. (QCI) to sell its lidar assets for $22 million. (Luminar is also trying to sell its semiconductor division to QCI for $110 million.) Luminar has scheduled an auction for the end of this month in an attempt to solicit bids that might beat QCI’s offer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell tried to buy Luminar in October, months after his abrupt resignation as CEO due to an ethics inquiry, but before the company filed for bankruptcy. Representatives for his new venture, Russell AI Labs, have told TechCrunch that he remains interested in submitting a bid for Luminar’s lidar assets, but a formal offer has not yet been submitted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar has been seeking information from Russell since his resignation as it decides whether to take legal action against him. The founder has already turned over multiple computers but held on to his phone because of privacy concerns. (Luminar originally claimed it was seeking two phones from Russell, one provided by the company and one personal. Russell has since said in court filings that he only ever had one phone during his time at Luminar.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal values Diligent’s common stock at $29 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Diligent Robotics was founded in 2017 by Andrea Thomaz and Vivian Chu and has raised more than $75 million in venture capital — most recently raising a <a href=\"https://www.diligentrobots.com/blog/diligent-robotics-closes-25-million-to-advance-systemwide-expansions-of-socially-intelligent-service-robots-empower-healthcare-professionals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$25 million funding round in 2023</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition marks Serve’s first foray beyond its food-delivery roots. The sidewalk delivery robots company was incubated inside food delivery company Postmates in 2017. The project continued after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber bought Postmates</a>, before spinning off in 2021. Serve went <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/uber-nvidia-backed-serve-robotics-hits-public-markets-with-40m-splash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">public in April 2024 via a reverse merger</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Serve co-founder and CEO Ali Kashani doesn’t view the acquisition as a big deviation from the company’s initial target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company hasn’t focused specifically on healthcare thus far, how Diligent’s robot Moxi operates does fit squarely into the company’s thesis around last-mile delivery and robots that can navigate alongside humans, Kashani told TechCrunch in a recent interview. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a kind of a classic example of a prepared mind meets opportunity,” Kashani said. “Robots that are moving among people is the broader opportunity for us. Once you solve the problem, which is how to get robots to seamlessly move among people as autonomous machines, then you can bring it to a lot of other environments. We knew that we wanted to do this someday.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Healthcare wasn’t a specific goal for expansion either, Kashani said, but rather the companies were introduced at the perfect time. Diligent was looking to scale and Serve was opportunistically looking into new areas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We love the team; they have very similar DNA to us, which is, rather than building in a lab, they build in real life,” Kashani said. “It just seems like it’s really aligned with our mission.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Diligent will continue to operate relatively independently within Serve, Kashani said. Diligent will tap into Serve’s software and tools to help them work toward scale and the companies will share tech and collaborate, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kashani said this isn’t a pivot for the company, nor does it mean that Serve is looking to acquire more startups, he added. Kashani, who emphasized that Serve is still very focused on its sidewalk-delivery robots, said they would “keep our eyes open” for interesting companies as potential partners, not necessarily acquisition targets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Serve was able to grow its fleet of robots in 2025 from 100 to more than 2,000, he said. The company also signed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/doordash-to-use-serve-robotics-sidewalk-robots-for-deliveries-in-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnership with DoorDash</a> to facilitate some of their deliveries in Los Angeles in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our sidewalk business is what’s fueling everything,” Kashani said. “It’s creating the technology. It’s one of the largest autonomous fleets in the world right now and developing that helps us create everything that we need in other applications.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The organization would not say whether it plans to inform users about the security incident. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, a person who asked not to be named alerted TechCrunch to the security flaw on UStrive’s mentoring platform. By examining the network traffic while signed in and navigating the site — such as viewing user profiles — anyone could see streams of users’ personal information in their browser tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The person said that UStrive was relying on a vulnerable Amazon-hosted GraphQL endpoint — a type of query database interface — that allowed access to reams of user data stored on UStrive’s servers. Some user records contained more data than others, including information provided by the student, such as their gender and date of birth. The person said that there were at least 238,000 user records at the time of discovery. UStrive meanwhile states on its <a href=\"https://ustrive.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">home page</a> that more than “1.1 million students have opted in for a UStrive mentor.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch confirmed the data exposure after creating a new user account on UStrive, and notified the company’s executives by email on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">John D. McIntyre, an attorney with Virginia law firm McIntyre Stein, which is representing UStrive, said in a letter provided to TechCrunch later on Thursday that UStrive is “currently in litigation with one of its former software engineers,” and as such the company is “somewhat limited in its ability to respond.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch told McIntyre that the company at that time still had a security lapse exposing the private and personal information of children, and asked McIntyre to notify TechCrunch if UStrive planned to fix the data exposure, and if so, by when.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McIntyre did not respond to our inquiry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to TechCrunch’s initial outreach, UStrive chief technology officer Dwamian Mcleish told TechCrunch by email late on Thursday that the exposure had been “remediated.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch sent Mcleish follow-up emails with more questions about the incident, including: whether the company plans to notify its users about the security lapse, whether the company has the ability to check if there was any improper or malicious access to users’ data, and whether the company’s platform had undergone a security audit and, if so, by whom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UStrive founder Michael J.

The U.S. government doesn’t have Mastodon accounts, but users can <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/112208521589924874\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">follow accounts like @potus on Threads</a> from their Mastodon accounts, if they choose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One reason for avoiding <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/what-is-mastodon/\">Mastodon</a>, an open source federated app that runs on the ActivityPub protocol, could be its smaller size. But also, any government account joining this network could be easily blocked by individual server operators. This wouldn’t prevent the account from setting up its own server to post to the fediverse, but other communities could refuse to federate (interoperate) with that server, greatly diminishing its reach. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon’s founder Eugen Rochko, who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\">stepped down as CEO in November</a>, citing burnout, recently posted <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/115911622720100646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an anti-ICE message on Mastodon</a>, noting that “Abolish ICE” doesn’t go “nearly far enough” to address the problem in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A day later, he <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/115912977448929626\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> he was opting his account out of the bridge that connects Mastodon with Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bridging technology, which includes <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/bridgy-fed-a-project-to-connect-the-open-social-web-is-now-becoming-a-nonprofit/\">the project known as Bridgy Fed</a>, is meant to allow different decentralized platforms to connect with each other, even if they run different protocols, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/\">as is the case with Bluesky</a>, which runs on AT Protocol. Coincidentally, <a href=\"https://blog.anew.social/launch-domain-blocklists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bridgy Fed today launched a way to add domain blocklists</a> to bridged accounts, which would conceivably allow fediverse users to block the government agencies posting on Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reached for comment, Rochko wouldn’t confirm whether or not ICE’s participation on Bluesky was a factor in his decision to leave the bridge, saying that the decision was a “personal” one. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there has often been tension between the fediverse and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/beyond-bluesky-these-are-the-apps-building-social-experiences-on-the-at-protocol/\">the atmosphere</a>, or the decentralized social platform that includes Bluesky and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/beyond-bluesky-these-are-the-apps-building-social-experiences-on-the-at-protocol/\">other, newer networks and apps</a> like <a href=\"https://blackskyweb.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Blacksky</a>, <a href=\"https://northskysocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Northsky Social</a>, and more.

Brands sell their excess inventory at discount retailers like Nordstrom Rack, but often lose money because managing unsold inventory is difficult. Products are spread across warehouses, and teams are left guessing the value of an item and when the best time to sell it is. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Too much time passes between each step of the off-channel inventory funnel, making it difficult to move products to the destinations that are most favorable for the brands and retailers,” Marshall told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She decided to give the off-channel market a tech boost. In 2024, she launched her company Another, a software system that helps companies manage unsold or excess products. The secondary markets where these items are usually sold operate under tight timelines and can feature highly dynamic pricing due to fluctuating demand. For a retailer to succeed in a place like Nordstrom Rack, it needs to have fast access to real-time data and coordination so that clothes can efficiently move from the retailer to the warehouse to the store, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another connects to a business’s existing software systems, such as those that manage customer returns, to better centralize an organization’s data and workflows. This way, teams across the company can access data from the same place, making decision-making more effective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced Tuesday a $2.5 million seed round led by Anthemis FIL and Westbound. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marshall said she met her lead investors through an industry event last year and said the fresh capital will be used to speed product development and hire. She considers her competitors’ marketplaces like Ghost, another company that also helps brands sell unsold inventory.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, she said, Another hopes to help companies address excess inventory before brands opt to sell items to bulk resellers. She says items sold through such resellers may be deeply discounted, an outcome brands might not want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Another’s technology provides real-time data and insights that give teams confidence in when, where, and how to move inventory, enabling smarter decisions that maximize value rather than defaulting to liquidation,” she said. Overall, she hopes her product helps move the industry toward solutions that better balance profitability and sustainability, as excess inventory is often destroyed if it is not moved quickly enough. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Consumers gain access to better prices, more optionality, while brands and retailers improve profitability and reduce waste, making it a win for everyone involved.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Applications that are available on Setapp Desktop will not be affected, the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news of the shutdown, announced on <a href=\"https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/13690464925212-About-Setapp-Mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Setapp’s support site</a>, was first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/setapp-mobile-eu-app-store-closing-next-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MacRumors</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MacPaw stated that “still-evolving and complex business terms that don’t fit Setapp’s current business model” are the reason for its decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “complex business terms” being referenced here are Apple’s complicated set of fees for apps operating under its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/apple-revises-its-dma-rules-after-pressure-but-keeps-the-core-technology-fee-intact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new business terms in the EU,</a> which include a controversial <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Core Technology Fee</a> that charges developers €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant revised its fee structure last year to avoid further penalties for noncompliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), but instead of simplifying the fees, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/apple-updates-the-rules-for-its-eu-app-store-by-adding-more-complicated-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it made them more complex</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One result of these constant changes is that developers can’t properly plan how to grow and monetize their business. It also suggests the fees, as they stand, don’t make running an alternative app store in the EU a viable option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Setapp said it found its business model was not “viable,” as the commercial conditions continued to change. The statement reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Setapp Mobile was a bold, breakthrough project that aimed to provide EU iOS users with access to alternative app marketplaces — creating a new app ecosystem where both developers and users could thrive. We are proud of what we have accomplished with it over the past two years and still believe passionately in this vision. As a result of still-evolving commercial conditions, we have determined that it is not viable to continue development or support for Setapp Mobile within Setapp’s current business model. While we are disappointed to discontinue Setapp Mobile and let down our user base and developer community in the EU, we are looking forward to pursuing the development of other innovations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/move-over-apple-meet-the-alternative-app-stores-coming-to-the-eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">still other alternative app stores operating in the EU</a>, including, most notably, the <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Epic Games Store</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/16/fortnite-maker-epic-games-launches-its-app-store-on-ios-in-the-eu-worldwide-on-android/\">from the maker of Fortnite</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open source AltStore</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Restaurants partner with Claim to create promotions, boost foot traffic, and track performance insights through the Claim dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; however, Claim raised a total of $20 million, <a href=\"https://www.claim.co/blog/announcing-our-12m-series-a-led-by\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it said</a>, when it raised its $12 million Series A in October, 2024. PitchBook estimated its valuation at $62 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grubhub says the acquisition will give restaurants on its platform access to Claim’s customer acquisition and retention tools, while Grubhub diners will receive additional savings and rewards for dining out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By combining a delightful rewards experience and powerful machine learning models, we match restaurants with their next regulars. Claim is a game-changer for these businesses, and joining Grubhub marks an exciting new chapter as we scale to reach millions more diners and thousands of restaurants,” Claim CEO and co-founder Sam Obletz in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grubhub told TechCrunch that all members of the Claim team were extended offers to join Grubhub. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under Grubhub, Claim will enable more restaurants to connect with consumers through personalized rewards.

The startup aims to use software to help people collaborate with each other — think an AI version of an instant messaging app. One of their goals is to use existing AI techniques to train AI in new ways, like programming chatbots to request information from the user and store it for later use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In order to build AI that serves “as a deeper connective tissue that strengthens organizations and communities,” Humans&amp; hopes to rethink “how we train models at scale and how people interact with AI,” per the company’s web page. The startup cited a need for innovations in “long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding,” as well as a tightly integrated focus on both science and product development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Humans&amp; seed round, while enormous, is far from an outlier in the current AI funding environment.

While Swiggy doesn’t play a part in product development, its sales team provides input to Eat App about potential features it can develop for the market.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083694\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg 3420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=1200,653 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=1280,696 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=430,234 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=720,392 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=900,489 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=800,435 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=1536,835 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=2048,1114 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=668,363 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=1134,617 1134w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=708,385 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Product-Banner-5.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Eat App</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before its India expansion, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was its biggest market, followed by the U.S., the U.K., and Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Honestly, like we see India, there’s very strong synergy and similarities between what we’ve seen in the [GCC] region eight, nine years ago, especially in Dubai, where we first, I would say, we were responsible for building that scaffolding, that tech infrastructure layer [for serving restaurants]. And we see a lot of similarities in India [to that],” Nezar Kadhem, CEO of Eat App, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We hope that whatever efforts were made in the region in Dubai and where restaurants have the tooling today, we could serve the same in India alongside local founders like Vijayan and the team to help us spearhead the change in India,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is a market with a big opportunity in the restaurant space. However, for restaurants, the challenge is to attract customers using every channel possible and then collate those reservations in one place. Parthasarathy noted that the top 200 restaurants in India are only available for customers through reservations. But for the next few thousand restaurants, it is a lot about capacity management through different channels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eat App’s growth faces a few obstacles. First, there are international competitors such as SevenRooms, TableCheck, and OpenTable, along with local ones like Petpooja and Posist. Second, some restaurants just bank on walk-ins or do not use an aggregation software to get data about their diners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several industry executives TechCrunch spoke with said that reservation aggregation software as a stand-alone product wouldn’t entice restaurant owners. Eat App will need to prove its growth suite brings enough value to restaurants.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
