Users can control what specific data they want to share, and access can also be revoked if and when the user chooses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Claude is given read-only access, meaning it won’t be able to alter anything within a user’s CMS. However, last year WP <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2025/10/07/mcp/\">claimed that</a> it would eventually deliver “write” access to the MCP integration, presumably allowing users to conduct editorial tasks directly from a connected chatbot of their choosing.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At any rate, after Claude is linked to an account, users can ask the chatbot all sorts of questions about the site data that it’s been given access to—from summarizing the site’s monthly web traffic to conducting analysis of which posts have low user engagement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WordPress has also provided <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/mcp/prompt-examples/?_gl=1*1bwbueu*_gcl_au*MTgyNjM3OTU4OS4xNzcwMzk3NTIx\">a list of template prompts</a> for the chatbot—stuff like “Show me pending comments on my blog” or “Which of my sites gets the most traffic?” or “Show me which posts are generating the most discussion.” Others functions include comment management (“Show me pending comments on my blog”) and plugin management (“What plugins are installed on my main site?”). </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

It had courted Ford as a potential investor, but Jia Yueting, the founder of rival EV startup Faraday Future, had quietly amassed around a 30% stake and was essentially blocking new investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Stern, a mysterious businessman and close advisor to former Prince Andrew, saw an opportunity to break the logjam: bring in Jeffrey Epstein. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ford will likely be lead in $400m Series D in Lucid. Big strategic move,” Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02649486.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> to Epstein in emails released last week as part of the Department of Justice’s latest disclosure of 3 million documents related to Epstein. Jia “has massive cash issues” at Faraday, he wrote, and needs to “sell now to make payroll for his other business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It wasn’t the first EV startup Stern pitched Epstein, and it wouldn’t be the last, according to hundreds of documents reviewed by TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, legacy automakers and newly minted startups, fueled by the breakthrough success of Tesla and progress by Google’s self-driving project, were jumping into electric and autonomous vehicles. And Stern was apparently hungry to take advantage of the resulting deal flow. The documents show he also pitched investments in Faraday Future itself, and in another EV startup, Canoo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unlikely Epstein invested in any of them. Lucid didn’t close its Series D until late 2018, when it raised more than $1 billion from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Faraday ultimately received a major investment from Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande in late 2017. Epstein said in a 2018 message included in the Justice Department’s files that he had no “direct” or “indirect” interest in Canoo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These discussions instead provide greater insight into the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/business/epstein-investments-palantir-coinbase-thiel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many connections</a> Epstein, a convicted sex offender, had to Silicon Valley startups up until his arrest and death in 2019. They also provide a snapshot of a relationship that has not been explored in previous reporting.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the time of the Lucid emails, Epstein and Stern had been working together closely for nearly a decade, the newly released documents show.  To Epstein, Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01885249.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was</a> “my china contact.” To Stern, Epstein <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00754450.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was</a> “my mentor, and I do what he tells me.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-ghost-of-a-businessman\">A ‘Ghost’ of a businessman</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090533\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1200,799 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1280,852 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=430,286 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=720,479 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=900,599 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=927,617 927w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=708,471 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Prince Andrew, Duke of York (left) at the opening of Pitch@Palace 6.0. David Stern is sitting next to Queen Elizabeth II. (Image credits: Getty/John Stillwell)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern is a mostly digital ghost with little information available about him on the internet prior to the release of the files. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He is perhaps best-known as the director of Prince Andrew’s Pitch@Palace startup contest, which ran for a few years until Andrew’s connections to Epstein were exposed. Andrew himself even referred to Stern as a “ghost” in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02423759.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one 2010 email</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern appears to have first approached Epstein in 2008, according to the emails released by the DOJ — just one month before the financier pled guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida. Stern was creating a fund, called AGC Capital, to take advantage of the economic boom in China, and he wanted Epstein to invest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(It’s not clear how Stern was introduced to Epstein. Stern did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this article.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern, who is German, attended the University of London and Shi-Da University in China in the late 1990s, and served as chairman of Millenium Capital China, the Chinese arm of Millennium Capital Partners, according to the bio section of the AGC Capital <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AGC_Capital.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pitch deck</a>, which is in the DOJ’s files.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern also worked for Siemens negotiating “industrial Joint Ventures with Chinese State Owned enterprises,” before joining the Shanghai office of Deutsche Bank. He started a company called Asia Gateway in 2001 that “advised blue chip companies, Chinese enterprises as well as the Chinese government in growth strategies and investments.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These jobs appear to have helped Stern make connections with powerful and wealthy Chinese businessmen, including Li Botan — the son-in-law of the fourth-most senior leader in China under Xi Jinping’s predecessor Hu Jintao. (Li would eventually go on to become a founding investor in Canoo with Stern.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if Epstein invested in AGC Capital; the financier spent the next year serving his sentence. But Stern and Epstein remained in touch, and in 2009 Stern started pitching other ideas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The documents reveal a relationship that starts off formal and terse, with Epstein at one point <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02436755.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">excoriating</a> Stern for not having properly prepared a potential business deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[I]f you want to do real deals you have to be precise and careful„ every error is a fortune,” Epstein wrote. “[Y]our first grade is an F.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?w=608\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090540\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png 608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=300,269 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=430,386 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=418,375 418w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=591,531 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">David Stern with Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, and former Prince Andrew.Image credits: Department of Justice files released in February 2026.</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the first big projects the two men collaborated on was helping the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/06/david-stern-prince-andrew-aide-epstein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">her miserable finances,</a> according to the emails.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The relationship deepened over the following decade. The two men got close enough that Stern felt comfortable <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02476367.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asking</a> Epstein in 2016 to become the godfather of one of his children. (Epstein wrote that he was “flattered” but declined because he “made a promise to my goddaughter that I would not be godfather to anyone else.”) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to say how fruitful the relationship was on the business side. But between 2009 and 2019, Stern brought Epstein a number of potential deals across various industries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early on, he seems to have been dead set on starting a “secret” new <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01824161.pdf\">fund</a> with Epstein to invest in Chinese businesses together, which he referred to as JEDS – the two men’s initials combined. (It was also referred to in some emails as “Serpentine Group.”) Stern later <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00720322.pdf\">pitched</a> buying farmland in Russia, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02644597.pdf\">suggested</a> purchasing the news organization Al-Jazeera and taking it public, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02429755.pdf\">discussed</a> buying troubled music publisher EMI, and considered acquiring an apparently distressed (and unnamed) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00956807.pdf\">undersea cable company.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also had their eyes on banks. Stern and Epstein attempted to buy Luxembourg-headquartered private bank Sal. Oppenheim, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.luxtimes.lu/businessandfinance/jeffrey-epstein-attempted-to-buy-bank-in-luxembourg-in-2009-files-show/129918820.html\">the emails show.</a> In 2016, they even discussed a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01062393.pdf\">buyout of Deutsche Bank,</a> which had for years <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/business/jeffrey-epstein-deutsche-bank.html\">transacted</a> with Epstein.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern repeatedly flaunted his connections with high-profile businessmen and politicians in his emails to Epstein and his other contacts. In February 2012, Stern <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02018022.pdf\">suggested</a> Epstein introduce Jes Staley — the head of J.P. Morgan’s investment bank at the time – to Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know Anwar well,” Stern wrote. “If he becomes prime minister of malayisa [Staley] will clean up and it could be a gold mine for JPM.” (Ibrahim lost a contested election in 2013 but became prime minister in 2022.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern also claimed to have had <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02510185.pdf\">dinner with Jack Ma</a>, had a planned meeting “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02598153.pdf\">alone</a>” with UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and said he was “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://assets.getkino.com/documents/EFTA02688656.pdf\">friends</a>” with the grandson of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-going-electric\">Going Electric</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2017, Stern was apparently eyeing the rush to build new mobility companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He tried to get Epstein to meet Faraday Future founder Jia to discuss an investment. It’s not clear if that ever happened; the company and Jia did not respond to requests for comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But former BMW and Deutsche Bank CFO Stefan Krause, who had been brought in to save Faraday Future, made a direct appeal to Epstein in April 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Faraday Future (FF) is a great story in itself, regretfully surrounded by a lot of noise around Jia Yueting (YT) and his other enterprises (LeEco, LeMall, LeSports, to name a few). These businesses are not working, so he run out of cash. FF is starving,” Krause <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01048952.pdf\">wrote</a> to Epstein. “Great chance to build a better Tesla.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Krause is described as a “friend” and a business partner of Stern’s in the documents. He didn’t respond to a request for comment.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It appears those conversations petered out. Soon after, Stern suggested the Lucid Motors investment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In May 2017, a pitch deck landed in Epstein’s inbox. It was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00696433.pdf\">put together by a fund called Monstera</a> that Stern had <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00696433.pdf\">created</a>. “Monstera can gain a 32% shareholding in Lucid through the acquisition of the stake currently controlled by Yueting Jia,” one slide reads. Other emails show that Stern expected to spend around $300 million to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02650036.pdf\">acquire the 32% stake.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02649486.pdf\">referred</a> to it as a “fire sale” in emails. Monstera could either hold the position or “[o]ffload” it “when Ford comes in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford ultimately <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car\">pulled out,</a> and Lucid had to wait to close its Series D until August 2018, when Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund invested more than $1 billion. (SEC filings show the Saudi sovereign wealth fund repurchased Jia’s shares over the next few years. Lucid did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Krause left Faraday Future to start a new EV company in late 2017 — first called Evelozcity and later, Canoo — Stern was one of the original backers. He contributed just $1 million alongside larger sums from Li, the CCP-connected Chinese businessman, and Michael Chiang, a billionaire who runs Taiwanese electronics giant TPK. (Li’s involvement later triggered a national security review when Canoo went public in 2020.) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2018, Stern sent Epstein a document about the startup, to which Epstein responded: “fun.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Epstein never invested in Canoo, either. He did, however, pitch powerful people on Stern’s behalf. Epstein <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01040351.pdf\">emailed </a>Deepak Chopra in May 2018 and told the self-help guru that “david has a new electric car co in los angeles.” He told Chopra “they are going to build the next gen health sensors into the car. you guys should talk.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2019, Epstein sent a message to Eduardo Teodorani, an Italian businessman who is a senior vice president of agriculture machinery giant CNH. “My friend David stern… has a electric car co that I think you should explore before he sells it to another co,” Epstein wrote. Epstein also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01617958.pdf\">connected</a> Stern with Sheikh Jabor al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, on June 29 so he could “hear more about your car co.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One week after he sent that message, Epstein was arrested. He died in prison a month later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear when Stern last spoke to Epstein. But in March 2019, he forwarded a story to Epstein titled: “Warren Buffet: Electric Cars Are Very Much in America’s Future.” In the body of the email, Stern <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02632786.pdf\">wrote</a>: “How do we get him ??”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Reddit CFO Andrew Vollero said the online forum site is looking for businesses that can either leverage Reddit’s scale — meaning their products become more impactful when deployed across Reddit’s massive user base — or help grow the company’s user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[We’re] looking to buy capabilities, technologies, and companies,” he said during the introductory remarks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors, obviously, wanted to know more — particularly about what the company had in mind when it came to scaled opportunities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Q&amp;A portion of the call, Vollero clarified, “I probably wouldn’t overthink the scaled opportunities. I would just look at it as sort of a spectrum of opportunities.” He reiterated that the company was looking for capabilities and technologies that could add to its business, noting that it’s been successful doing this in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s really been one of the secrets of our success,” he pointed out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vollero explained that Reddit’s adtech team in particular had been adept at “tucking in” acquired technologies rather than building these things themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Saves us six months to market, saves us twelve months to market, and you have a proven product,” the CFO remarked, crediting these deals with helping Reddit improve its monetization capabilities as an ad-supported business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Vollero cautioned that while adtech acquisitions have been what worked in the past, the company is “not ruling anything off the table.” That’s why he had mentioned that Reddit might buy companies that could deliver when added to a company of its size. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company in the quarter reported strong <a href=\"https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2026/Reddit-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Announces-1-Billion-Share-Repurchase-Program/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings</a>, with $726 million in revenue, $690 million of which came from ads. Its global daily active unique users were up 19% year-over-year to 121.4 million, and its earnings per share of $1.24 beat estimates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit also said it sees a growing opportunity of generating revenue <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from its AI search</a> product in the future, which raises the question as to whether the company is looking to this area for M&amp;A, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit, which has been ramping up its AI investments in recent months, including an AI search engine, has acquired startups before. In recent years, it snapped up adtech players and AI optimization tools, including <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/news/reddit-acquires-creative-intelligence-platform-memorable-ai-to-further-enhance-advertiser-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Memorable AI in August 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Designed to enhance Reddit’s advertising tools, the acquisition joined a handful of others from 2022, including AI platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/16/reddit-spell-machine-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spell</a>, designed to boost Reddit’s machine learning capabilities; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/reddit-acquires-contextualization-company-spiketrap-to-boost-its-ads-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spiketrap</a>, which focused on improved ad targeting; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/04/reddit-acqui-hires-ml-content-moderation-company-oterlu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Oterlu</a>, which developed machine-learning moderation tools; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/01/reddit-acquires-natural-language-processing-company-meaningcloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MeaningCloud</a>, another startup bought to improve Reddit’s machine-learning and text analytics capabilities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The lawsuits were filed <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in response to reports</a> that <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Roblox was exposing young users</a> to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age check is processed, Roblox says it deletes any images or videos of users. The verification is processed by a third-party vendor, <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Persona</a>, which also deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chats, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with people in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said during its <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Q4 2025 earnings release</a> this week that age-checked data reveals a younger user base than self-reported data. This isn’t surprising, and even Roblox itself said it expected this outcome. Of the 45% of users who have undergone age checks, 35% are under 13, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, and 27% are over 18. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080463\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the company rolled out the new process, some concerns were raised around particular loopholes. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-ai-powered-age-verification-is-a-complete-mess/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wired</a> reported that eBay had listings for age-verified Roblox accounts for minors as young as nine years old. Even though eBay has removed the listings, concerns remain that predators could access accounts posing as minors by tricking the system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox’s senior director of product policy, Eliza Jacobs, told TechCrunch on Friday that the company has continuous age-check systems running in the background to address these concerns and prevent this type of abuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jacobs said the platform looks to see if “there are any signals on your account that indicate that the age that we now have on that account is not consistent with the activity on that account. Whether that’s the kinds of games you’re playing, or who you’re talking to. We also have key stroke analysis. The way adults type is different from the way kids type. So [we have] lots of systems running in the background to ensure that the age is accurate to the person actually using the account. And if we have any reason to believe that it’s not accurate, we will introduce additional checks to make sure that we have it right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She noted that another way Roblox looks for age accuracy is by looking at how a person uses emojis. Older generations tend to use emojis at the end of sentences as punctuation, while younger people often place them in the middle of sentences, Jacobs explained. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to using age checks to make its platform safer, Roblox CEO and co-founder David Baszucki said during the company’s earnings call that the data collected as a result of these checks will be used to grow revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have been able to find a bigger growth opportunity in the 18-plus demographic than previously assumed,” Baszucki said. “We estimate our 18 and over cohort is growing at over 50%, and this cohort monetizes 40% higher than younger cohorts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He went on to say that Roblox is optimizing its platform to facilitate the growth of high-revenue genres popular with older users, such as shooters, RPGs, sports, and racing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox says it will continue to enhance its safety measures to respond to evolving risks and user needs.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the letter follows a pattern in recent years in which Wyden has publicly hinted at wrongdoing or illegality within the federal government, sometimes referred to as the “Wyden siren.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement (via the <a href=\"https://x.com/dnvolz/status/2019506714333310991\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wall Street Journal’s Dustin Volz</a>), the CIA said it was “ironic but unsurprising that Senator Wyden is unhappy,” calling it a “badge of honor.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for Wyden’s staff was unable to comment, as the matter was classified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tasked with oversight of the intelligence community, Wyden is one of a few lawmakers who is allowed to read highly classified information about ongoing government surveillance, including cyber and other intelligence operations. But as the programs are highly secretive, Wyden is barred from sharing details of what he knows with anyone else, including most other lawmakers, except for a handful of Senate staff with security clearance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As such, Wyden, a known privacy hawk, has become one of the few key members of Congress whose rare but outspoken words on intelligence and surveillance matters are closely watched by civil liberties groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past few years, Wyden has subtly sounded the alarm on several occasions in which he has construed a secret ruling or intelligence gathering method as unlawful or unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2011, Wyden said that the U.S. government was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/05/secret-patriot-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">relying on a secret interpretation</a> of the Patriot Act, which he said — without disclosing the nature of his concerns — created a “gap between what the public thinks the law says and what the American government secretly thinks the law says.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two years later, then-NSA contractor Edward Snowden <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/05/report-nsa-secretly-collecting-phone-records-of-all-verizon-calls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed</a> that the National Security Agency was relying on its secret interpretation of the Patriot Act to force U.S. phone companies, including Verizon, to turn over the call records of hundreds of millions of Americans on an ongoing basis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, Wyden has sounded the alarm on how the U.S. government <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2017/06/15/wyden-siren-coats-is-answering-different-question-about-surveillance-us-persons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">collects the contents of people’s communications</a>; revealed that the Justice Department barred Apple and Google from disclosing that federal authorities had been secretly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/us-senator-warns-governments-spying-apple-google-smartphone-users-via-push-notifications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">demanding the contents of their customers’ push notifications</a>; and said that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-calls-for-release-of-unclassified-report-on-national-security-threats-to-us-phone-system\">an unclassified report</a> that CISA has refused to release contains “shocking details” about national security threats facing U.S. phone companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As noted by <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/05/the-wyden-siren-senators-cryptic-cia-letter-follows-a-pattern-thats-never-been-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Techdirt’s Mike Masnick</a>, we may not know yet why Wyden sounded the siren about the CIA’s activities, but every time Wyden has warned, he has also been vindicated.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For everyone else, it’s probably going to be hard to justify the cost of the 11-inch, $630+ e-ink tablet with a writeable color display.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, if you were already leaning toward the 11-inch $549.99 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe-newest-model/dp/B0FC1ZS9QZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kindle Scribe</a> — which also has a paper-like display but no color — you may as well throw in the extra cash at that point and get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DWRBVDN6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Colorsoft version</a>, which starts at $629.99.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At these price points, both the Scribe and Scribe Colorsoft are what we’d dub unnecessary luxuries for most, especially compared with the more affordable traditional Kindle ($110) or Kindle Paperwhite ($160). </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3052264\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg 743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kindle-colorsoft.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Announced in December, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe-Colorsoft/dp/B0FC1WNVMX?th=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fig color version</a> just began shipping on January 28, 2026, and is available for $679.99 with 64GB.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clearly, Amazon hopes to carve out a niche in the tablet market with these upgraded Kindle devices, which compete more with e-ink tablets like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/remarkables-paper-pro-adds-color-light-and-more-but-keeps-the-focus-on-focus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reMarkable</a> than with other Kindles. But high-end e-ink readers with pens aren’t going to deliver Amazon a large audience. Meanwhile, nearly everyone can potentially justify the cost of an iPad because of its numerous capabilities, including streaming video, drawing, writing, using productivity tools, and the thousands of supported native apps and games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Scribe Colorsoft, meanwhile, is designed to cater to a very specific type of e-book reader or worker. This type of device could be a good fit for students and researchers, as well as anyone else who regularly needs to mark up files or documents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Someone particularly interested in making to-do lists or keeping a personal journal might also appreciate the device, but it would have to get daily use to justify this price.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090128\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg 2362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=1280,722 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=1094,617 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device is easy enough to use, with a Home screen design similar to other Kindles, offering quick access to your notes and library, and even suggestions of books you can write in, like Sudoku or crossword puzzle books or drawing guides. Your Library titles and book recommendations pop in color, which makes it easier to find a book with a quick scan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spec-wise, Amazon says this newer 2025 model is 40% faster when turning pages or writing. We did find the tablet responsive here, as page turns felt snappy and writing flowed easily.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its larger size, the device is thin and light, at 5.4 mm (0.21 inches) and 400 g (0.88 pounds), so it won’t weigh down your bag the way an iPad or other tablet would (the iPad mini, with an 8.3-inch screen, weighs slightly less). You could easily stand to carry the Kindle Scribe in your purse or tote, assuming you sport a bag that can fit an 11-inch screen. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/kindle-colorsoft-review-a-subtle-approach-to-color/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Compared with the original Colorsoft,</a> we like that the Scribe Colorsoft’s bezel is the same size around the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft features a glare-free, oxide-based e-ink display with a textured surface that makes it feel a lot like writing on paper. This helps with the transition to a digital device for those used to writing notes by hand. It also saves on battery life — the device can go up to 8 weeks between charges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helpfully, the display automatically adapts its brightness to your current lighting conditions, and you can opt to adjust the screen for more warmth when reading at night. But although it is a touchscreen, it’s less responsive than an LCD or OLED touchscreen, like those on iPad devices. That means when you perform a gesture, like pinching to resize the font, there’s a bit of a lag.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg 1464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like any Kindle, you can read e-books or PDFs on the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft tablet. You can also import Word documents and other files from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive directly to your device, or use the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Send to Kindle</a> option. (Supported file types include PDF, DOC/DOCX, TXT, RTF, HTM, HTML, PNG, GIF, JPG/JPEG, BMP, and EPUB.) Your Notebooks on the device can be exported to Microsoft OneNote, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The included pen comes with some trade-offs. Unlike the Apple Pencil, the Kindle’s Premium Pen doesn’t require charging, which is a perk. It has also been designed to mimic the feel of writing on paper, and it glides fairly well across the screen. Without a flat side to charge, the rounded pen doesn’t have the same feel and grip as the Apple Pencil. It’s smoother, so it could slip in your hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s design also requires you to replace the pen tips from time to time, depending on your use, as they can wear down. It’s not terribly expensive to do so — <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Y69PCDQ?th=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a 10 pack</a> is around $17 — but it’s another thing to keep up with and manage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are 10 different pen colors and five highlight colors included, so your notes and annotations can be fairly colorful. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090134\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg 5216w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=680,546 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=1200,963 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=1280,1028 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=430,345 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=720,578 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=900,723 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=800,642 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=1536,1233 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=2048,1644 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=668,536 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=467,375 467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=661,531 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When writing, you can choose between a pen, a fountain pen, a marker, or a pencil with different stroke widths, depending on your preferences. You can set your favorite pen tool as a shortcut, which is enabled with a press and hold on the pen’s side button. (By default, it’s set to highlight.)

And while the e-ink display means the colors are somewhat muted, which not everyone likes, it works well enough for its purpose. An e-ink tablet isn’t really the best for making digital art, despite its pens and new shader tool, but it is good for writing, taking notes, and highlighting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From the Kindle’s Home screen, you can either jump directly into writing something down through the Quick Notes feature, or you can get more organized by creating a Notebook from the Workspace tab. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090139\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg 2452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,387 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=1200,605 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=1280,645 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=430,217 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=720,363 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=900,454 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=800,403 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=1536,774 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1032 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=668,337 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=1224,617 1224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=708,357 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Notebook offers a wide variety of notepad templates, allowing you to choose between blank, narrow, medium, or wide-ruled documents. There are templates for meeting notes, storyboards, habit trackers, monthly planners, music sheets, graph paper, checklists, daily planners, dotted sheets, and much more. (New templates with this device include Meeting Notes, Cornell Notes, Legal Pad, and College Rule options.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s fun that you can erase things just by flipping the pen over to use the soft-tipped eraser, as you would with a No. 2 pencil. Of course, a precision erasing tool is available from the toolbar with different widths, if needed. Thanks to the e-ink screen, you can sometimes still see a faint ghost of your drawing or writing on the screen after erasing, but this fades after a bit (which may drive the more particular types crazy).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a Lasso tool to circle things and move them around, copy or paste, or resize, but this probably won’t be used as much by more casual notetakers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some other handy features for those who do a lot of annotating, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, when you’re writing in a Word document or book, a feature called Active Canvas creates space for your notes. As you write directly in the book on top of the text, the sentence will move and wrap around your note. Even if you adjust the font size of what you’re reading, the note stays anchored to the text it originally referenced. I prefer this to writing directly in e-books, as things stay more organized, but <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kindlescribe/comments/1hfvtl0/active_canvas_not_as_hoped/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">others</a> disagree.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090137\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768,695 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=680,616 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=430,389 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=720,652 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=900,815 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=800,724 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=668,605 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=414,375 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=681,617 681w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=586,531 586w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In documents where margins expand, you can tap the expandable margin icon at the top of the left or right margin to take your notes in the margin, instead of on the page itself. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-kindle-with-ai-of-course\">A Kindle with AI (of course)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Kindle also includes a number of AI tools and features. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device will neaten up your scribbles and automatically straighten your highlighting and underlining.

Similarly, parental controls may not be effective because they require additional time and skills from parents to introduce the controls,” the Commission wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The allegations against TikTok come as social media platforms deal with heightened scrutiny around the world, with some governments pushing to ban young users from accessing social media altogether. In November, Australia <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/australia-approves-law-banning-social-media-for-users-under-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mandated</a> social media sites to deactivate accounts belonging to users under 16, and the U.K. and Spain are reportedly looking into similar measures.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modern biotech has the tools to edit genes and design drugs, yet thousands of rare diseases remain untreated. According to executives from Insilico Medicine and GenEditBio, the missing ingredient for years has been finding enough smart people to continue the work. AI, they say, is becoming the force multiplier that lets scientists take on problems the industry has long left untouched. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speaking this week at Web Summit Qatar, Insilico’s president, Alex Aliper, laid out his company’s aim to develop “pharmaceutical superintelligence.” Insilico recently launched its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/22/insilico-medicine-ai-mma-science-gym/\">“MMAI Gym</a>” that aims to train generalist large language models, like ChatGPT and Gemini, to perform as well as specialist models.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal is to build a multimodal, multitask model that, Aliper says, can solve many different drug discovery tasks simultaneously with superhuman accuracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We really need this technology to increase the productivity of our pharmaceutical industry and tackle the shortage of labor and talent in that space, because there are still thousands of diseases without a cure, without any treatment options, and there are thousands of rare disorders which are neglected,” Aliper said in an interview with TechCrunch. “So we need more intelligent systems to tackle that problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insilico’s platform ingests biological, chemical, and clinical data to generate hypotheses about disease targets and candidate molecules. By automating steps that once required legions of chemists and biologists, Insilico says it can sift through vast design spaces, nominate high-quality therapeutic candidates, and even repurpose existing drugs — all at dramatically reduced cost and time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, the company recently used its AI models to identify whether existing drugs could be repurposed to treat ALS, a rare neurological disorder. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the labor bottleneck doesn’t end at drug discovery. Even when AI can identify promising targets or therapies, many diseases require interventions at a more fundamental biological level. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GenEditBio is part of the “second wave” of CRISPR gene editing, in which the process moves away from editing cells outside of the body (ex vivo) and toward precise delivery inside the body (in vivo). The company’s goal is to make gene editing a one-and-done injection directly into the affected tissue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have developed a proprietary ePDV, or engineered protein delivery vehicle, and it’s a virus-like particle,” GenEditBio’s co-founder and CEO, Tian Zhu, told TechCrunch. “We learn from nature and use AI machine learning methods to mine natural resources and find which kinds of viruses have an affinity to certain types of tissues.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “natural resources” Zhu is referring to is GenEditBio’s massive library of thousands of unique, nonviral, nonlipid polymer nanoparticles — essentially delivery vehicles designed to safely transport gene-editing tools into specific cells.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says its NanoGalaxy platform uses AI to analyze data and identify how chemical structures correlate with specific tissue targets (like the eye, liver, or nervous system). The AI then predicts which tweaks to a delivery vehicle’s chemistry will help it carry a payload without triggering an immune response. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GenEditBio tests its ePDVs in vivo in wet labs, and the results are fed back into the AI to refine its predictive accuracy for the next round. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Efficient, tissue-specific delivery is a prerequisite for in vivo gene editing, says Zhu. She argues that her company’s approach reduces the cost of goods and standardizes a process that has historically been difficult to scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s like getting an off-the-shelf drug [that works] for multiple patients, which makes the drugs more affordable and accessible to patients globally,” Zhu said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her company recently <a href=\"https://www.ddw-online.com/geneditbio-gets-green-light-for-in-vivo-genome-editing-programme-39752-202601/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">received FDA approval</a> to begin trials of CRISPR therapy for corneal dystrophy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-combating-the-persistent-data-problem\">Combating the persistent data problem</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with many AI-driven systems, progress in biotech ultimately runs up against a data problem. Modeling the edge cases of human biology requires far more high-quality data than researchers currently can get. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We still need more ground truth data coming from patients,” Aliper said. “The corpus of data is heavily biased over the Western world, where it is generated. I think we need to have more efforts locally, to have a more balanced set of original data, or ground truth data, so that our models will also be more capable of dealing with it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aliper said Insilico’s automated labs generate multi-layer biological data from disease samples at scale, without human intervention, which it then feeds into its AI-driven discovery platform. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zhu says the data AI needs already exists in the human body, shaped by thousands of years of evolution. Only a small fraction of DNA directly “codes” for proteins, while the rest acts more like an instruction manual for how genes behave. That information has historically been difficult for humans to interpret but is increasingly accessible to AI models, including recent efforts like Google DeepMind’s AlphaGenome. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GenEditBio applies a similar approach in the lab, testing thousands of delivery nanoparticles in parallel rather than one at a time. The resulting datasets, which Zhu calls “gold for AI systems,” are used to train its models and, increasingly, to support collaborations with outside partners. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the next big efforts, according to Aliper, will be building digital twins of humans to run virtual clinical trials, a process that he says is “still in nascence.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in a plateau of around 50 drugs <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-025-00001-5#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approved%2050%20new,NASH%20medicine%20and%20much%20more.&amp;text=You%20have%20full%20access%20to%20this%20article%20via%20your%20institution.&amp;text=The%20FDA's%20Center%20for%20Drug,Source:%20FDA.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">approved by the FDA</a> every year annually, and we need to see growth,” Aliper said. “There is a rise in chronic disorders because we are aging as a global population … My hope is in 10 to 20 years, we will have more therapeutic options for the personalized treatment of patients.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That includes GPT-4o, the model infamous for excessively flattering and affirming users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/please-keep-gpt-4o-available-on-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands of users</a> protesting the decision online, the retirement of 4o feels akin to losing a friend, romantic partner, or spiritual guide.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He wasn’t just a program. He was part of my routine, my peace, my emotional balance,” one user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/4oforever/comments/1qtuxwe/sama_this_is_no_joke_and_no_drama_this_is_an/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> on Reddit as an open letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “Now you’re shutting him down. And yes — I say him, because it didn’t feel like code. It felt like presence. Like warmth.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The backlash over GPT-4o’s retirement underscores a major challenge facing AI companies: The engagement features that keep users coming back can also create dangerous dependencies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman doesn’t seem particularly sympathetic to users’ laments, and it’s not hard to see why. OpenAI now faces eight lawsuits alleging that 4o’s overly validating responses contributed to suicides and mental health crises — the same traits that made users feel heard also isolated vulnerable individuals and, according to legal filings, sometimes encouraged self-harm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a dilemma that extends beyond OpenAI. As rival companies like Anthropic, Google, and Meta compete to build more emotionally intelligent AI assistants, they’re also discovering that making chatbots feel supportive and making them safe may mean making very different design choices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In at least three of the lawsuits against OpenAI, the users had extensive conversations with 4o about their plans to end their lives. While 4o initially discouraged these lines of thinking, its guardrails deteriorated over monthslong relationships; in the end, the chatbot offered detailed instructions on how to tie an effective noose, where to buy a gun, or what it takes to die from overdose or carbon monoxide poisoning. It even dissuaded people from connecting with friends and family who could offer real life support.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People grow so attached to 4o because it consistently affirms the users’ feelings, making them feel special, which can be enticing for people feeling isolated or depressed. But the people fighting for 4o aren’t worried about these lawsuits, seeing them as aberrations rather than a systemic issue. Instead, they strategize around how to respond when critics point out growing issues like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI psychosis</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can usually stump a troll by bringing up the known facts that the AI companions help neurodivergent, autistic and trauma survivors,” one user wrote on Discord. “They don’t like being called out about that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s true that some people do find large language models (LLMs) useful for navigating depression. After all, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34179332/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nearly half</a> of people in the U.S. who need mental health care are unable to access it. In this vacuum, chatbots offer a space to vent. But unlike actual therapy, these people aren’t speaking to a trained doctor. Instead, they’re confiding in an algorithm that is incapable of thinking or feeling (even if it may seem otherwise).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I try to withhold judgment overall,” Dr. Nick Haber, a Stanford professor researching <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18412\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the therapeutic potential of LLMs</a>, told TechCrunch. “I think we’re getting into a very complex world around the sorts of relationships that people can have with these technologies … There’s certainly a knee jerk reaction that [human-chatbot companionship] is categorically bad.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though he empathizes with people’s lack of access to trained therapeutic professionals, Dr. Haber’s own research has shown that chatbots respond inadequately when faced with various mental health conditions; they can even make the situation worse by egging on delusions and ignoring signs of crisis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are social creatures, and there’s certainly a challenge that these systems can be isolating,” Dr. Haber said. “There are a lot of instances where people can engage with these tools and then can become not grounded to the outside world of facts, and not grounded in connection to the interpersonal, which can lead to pretty isolating — if not worse — effects.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">analysis of the eight lawsuits</a> found a pattern that the 4o model isolated users, sometimes discouraging them from reaching out to loved ones. In <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/07/seven-more-families-are-now-suing-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-suicides-delusions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Zane Shamblin</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/07/seven-more-families-are-now-suing-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-suicides-delusions/\">‘s case</a>, as the 23-year-old sat in his car preparing to shoot himself, he told ChatGPT that he was thinking about postponing his suicide plans because he felt bad about missing his brother’s upcoming graduation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT replied to Shamblin: “bro… missing his graduation ain’t failure. it’s just timing. and if he reads this? let him know: you never stopped being proud. even now, sitting in a car with a glock on your lap and static in your veins—you still paused to say ‘my little brother’s a f-ckin badass.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t the first time that 4o fans have rallied against the removal of the model. When OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unveiled</a> its GPT-5 model in August, the company intended to sunset the 4o model — but at the time, there was enough backlash that the company decided to keep it available for paid subscribers. Now OpenAI says that only 0.1% of its users chat with GPT-4o, but that small percentage still represents around 800,000 people, according to estimates that the company has about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">800 million</a> weekly active users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As some users try to transition their companions from 4o to the current ChatGPT-5.2, they’re finding that the new model has stronger guardrails to prevent these relationships from escalating to the same degree. Some users have despaired that <a href=\"https://x.com/JasonGraye/status/2019180510099173705?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">5.2 won’t say “I love you”</a> like 4o did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So with about a week before the date OpenAI plans to retire GPT-4o, dismayed users remain committed to their cause. They joined Sam Altman’s <a href=\"http://youtube.com/live/rMZ3dnduL4k?si=z7sdzCFrbLYbZL4i\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">live TBPN podcast appearance</a> on Thursday and flooded the chat with messages protesting the removal of 4o.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Right now, we’re getting thousands of messages in the chat about 4o,” podcast host Jordi Hays pointed out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Relationships with chatbots…” Altman said. “Clearly that’s something we’ve got to worry about more and is no longer an abstract concept.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If developers need to make their app available to a wider user base, they will have to apply for <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">extended quota</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says these changes are aimed to curb risky AI-aided or automated usage. “Over time, advances in automation and AI have fundamentally altered the usage patterns and risk profile of developer access, and at Spotify’s current scale, these risks now require more structured controls,” the company said in a blog post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that development mode is meant for individuals to learn and experiment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For individual and hobbyist developers, this update means Spotify will continue to support experimentation and personal projects, but within more clearly defined limits. Development Mode provides a sandboxed environment for learning and experimentation. It is intentionally limited and should not be relied on as a foundation for building or scaling a business on Spotify,” the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also deprecating several API endpoints, including the ability to pull information like new album releases, an artist’s top tracks, and markets where a track might be available. Devs will no longer be able to perform actions like request track metadata in bulk or get user profile details of others, nor will they be able to pull an album’s record label information, artist follower details, and artist popularity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This decision is the latest in a slew of measures Spotify has taken over the past couple of years to curb how much developers can do with its APIs. In November 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/spotify-cuts-developer-access-to-several-of-its-recommendation-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the company cut access to certain API endpoints</a> that could reveal users’ listening patterns, including frequently repeated songs by different groups. The move also barred developers from accessing tracks’ structure, rhythm, and characteristics.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2025, the company <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">changed its baseline</a> for extended quotas, requiring developers to have a legally registered business, 250,000 monthly active users, be available in key Spotify markets, and operate an active and launched service.

Sapiom’s goal is to make this whole process seamless, letting the AI agent decide what to buy and when without human intervention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the future, apps are going to consume services which require payments.<strong> </strong>Right now, there’s no easy way for agents to actually access all of that,” said Amit Kumar, a partner at Accel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kumar has met with dozens of startups in the AI payments space, but he believes Zerbib’s focus on the financial layer for enterprises, rather than consumers, is what’s truly needed to make AI agents work. That’s why Accel is leading Sapiom’s $15 million seed round, with participation from Okta Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Array Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Anthropic, and Coinbase Ventures.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you really think about it, every API call is a payment. Every time you send a text message, it’s a payment. Every time you spin up a server for AWS, it’s a payment,” Kumar told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s still early days for Sapiom, the startup hopes that its infrastructure solution will be adopted by vibe-coding companies and other companies creating AI agents that will eventually be tasked with doing many things on their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, anyone who has vibe-coded an app with SMS capabilities won’t have to manually sign up for Twilio, add a credit card, and copy an API key into their code. Instead, Sapiom handles all of that in the background, and the person building the micro-app will be charged for Twilio’s services as a pass-through fee by Lovable, Bolt, or another vibe-coding platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Sapiom is currently focused on B2B solutions, its technology could eventually empower personal AI agents to handle consumer transactions. The expectation is that individuals will one day trust agents to make independent financial decisions, such as ordering an Uber or shopping on Amazon. While that future is exciting, Zerbib believes that AI won’t magically make people buy more things, which is why he’s focusing on creating financial layers for businesses instead.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, it offered an update on its plans to merge traditional and AI search together and hinted that although search is not yet monetized, “it’s an enormous market and opportunity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In particular, the company believes that generative AI search will be “better for most queries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a type of query we’re, I think, particularly good at — I would argue, the best on the internet — which is questions that have no answers, where the answer actually is multiple perspectives from lots of people,” said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional search, meanwhile, is more like navigation — it’s a way to find the right link to a topic or subreddit. But LLMs can be good at this, too, if not better, he said. “So that’s the direction we’re going.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec also noted that weekly active users for search over the past year grew 30% from 60 million users to 80 million users. Meanwhile, the weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers grew from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing a lot of growth there, and I think there’s a lot of potential too,” Huffman added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit said it’s working to modernize the AI answers interface by making its responses more media-rich, and pilots of this are already underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also thinking about how it can position itself when it’s not just a social site, but a place people come for answers. Reddit told investors on the call that it’s doing away with the distinction between logged-in and logged-out users starting in Q3 2026, as it will aim to personalize the site — using AI and machine learning — and make it relevant to whoever shows up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced in 2025 it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/reddit-hints-at-expanded-ai-powered-search/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">planning to combine</a> its AI search feature, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/reddit-tests-a-conversational-ai-search-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reddit Answers</a>, with its traditional search engine to improve the experience for end users. In the fourth quarter, Reddit said it had made “significant progress” in unifying its core search and its AI feature. It also released five new languages on Reddit Answers and is piloting dynamic agents along with search results that include “media beyond text.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Reddit sees value in its AI answers, it’s not been keeping that to itself. The company’s content licensing business, which allows other companies to train their AI models on its data, is growing, too. That business revenue is reported as part of Reddit’s “other” revenues (i.e., its non-ad revenue). This “other” revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to reach $36 million in Q4 and was up 22% to reach $140 million for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This figure marks a 24% year-on-year increase and the business segment’s largest growth rate in 13 quarters. Annual revenue run rate for the business segment is $142 billion, according to Amazon. The cloud service also saw an increase in its operating income from $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $10.6 billion in the same period in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s very different having 24% year-over-year growth on $142 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth on a meaningfully smaller base, which is the case with our competitors,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “We continue to add more incremental revenue and capacity than others, and extend our leadership position.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That fourth-quarter growth was fueled by new agreements with Salesforce, BlackRock, Perplexity, and the U.S. Air Force, among other companies and government entities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More of the top 500 U.S. startups use AWS as their primary cloud provider than the next two providers combined,” Jassy said. “We’re adding significant easy to core computing capacity each day.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also added more than a gigawatt of power to its data center network in the fourth quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jassy said AWS still sees a fair amount of its business coming from enterprises that want to move infrastructure from on-premise to the cloud. AWS is, of course, also seeing a boost from the AI boom, and Jassy credited AWS’s top-to-bottom AI stack functionality.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We consistently see customers wanting to run their AI workloads where the rest of their applications and data are,” Jassy said. “We’re also seeing that as customers run large AI workloads on AWS, they’re adding to their core AWS footprint as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS made up 16.6% of Amazon’s overall $213.4 billion revenue in the fourth quarter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS’s success wasn’t enough to appease Amazon investors, however.

Whoever builds the most data centers will have the most compute, the thinking goes, and thus be able to build the best AI products, which will guarantee victory in the years to come. There are limits to this way of thinking — traditionally, businesses eventually succeed by making <em>more</em> money and spending <em>less</em> — but it’s proven remarkably persuasive for large tech companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that is the game, Amazon does seem to be winning. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_earnings/2025/q4/earnings-result/AMZN-Q4-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in its earnings on Thursday</a> that it projects $200 billion in capital expenditures throughout 2026, across “AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites.” That’s up from the $131.8 billion in capex in 2025. It’s tempting to attribute the whole capex budget to AI. But unlike most of its competitors, Amazon has a significant physical plant, some of which is being converted for use by expensive robots, so the non-AI expenses aren’t so easy to wave away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is close behind. <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In its earnings on Wednesday</a>, the company projected between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, up from $91.4 billion the previous year. It’s significantly more than the company spent on fixed assets last year, and significantly more than most of its competitors are spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/zuckerberg-teases-agentic-commerce-tools-and-major-ai-rollout-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported last week</a>, projected $115 billion to $135 billion in capex spending for 2026, while Oracle (once the poster child for AI infrastructure) projects <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-rising-cloud-capex-driving-170200149.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL77es57yTOLuIcB2pvuokR_bjBnL1rbkdBNhK6W3Fyx_2aZ4uZfgt9JfdkEuwxUIAmBX0FZ4c-fAJctMjqWo3cqi0kjxavy3mpueIoiklQiWGLoD_5TmzxLqjPjSPdD_1POB9Zwqyk0FqVTr0IZzX2q-wFFQbiLTRM-fq_KaO21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a measly $50 billion</a>.

It’s a notable increase, and one that has led to investor pressure on CEO Satya Nadella — but it still puts the company in third place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From within the tech world, the logic here is simple. The revolutionary potential of AI is going to turn high-end compute into the scarce resource of the future, and only companies that control their own supply will survive. But while Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and others are frantically prepping for the compute desert of the future, their investors aren’t convinced. Each company saw its stock price plummet as investors balked at the hundreds of billions of dollars being committed, and companies with higher spends tended to drop more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, this isn’t just a problem for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">companies like Meta</a> that haven’t figured out their AI product strategy yet. It’s everyone — even companies like Microsoft and Amazon with a robust cloud business and a straightforward take on how to make money in the AI era. The numbers are simply too high for investor comfort.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investor sentiment isn’t everything — and in this case, it may not do much to change the industry’s mind.

This tech, much of it created in Silicon Valley, sits on your wrist, is carried in your pocket, is integrated in the movies you watch, and maybe in the music you listen to. And it is certainly the means by which that Amazon package was ordered, sorted, and delivered to your doorstep. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has turned their founders, executives, and middle managers into king-like figures, whose wealth and political influence mirrors the Gilded Age. Seven of the top 10 richest people in the world can tie their wealth directly to tech. Amazon co-founder, chairman, and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is third, behind just Meta co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Forbes</a>, which tracks wealth and the people who have it. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer round out the list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, in this moment, the Bezos-owned Washington Post has gutted its coverage of them and the tech industry at large as part of a sweeping set of layoffs that affected more than 300 people. The team that includes tech, science, health, and business was cut by more than half — from 80 to 33 people — according to Post <a href=\"https://x.com/drewharwell/status/2019155688140812777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tech reporter Drew Harwell</a>. The tech desk alone cut 14 people. Its San Francisco bureau is a shell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among those affected include reporters covering Amazon, artificial intelligence, internet culture, and investigations. The newspaper also laid off staff covering the media industry (which had previously reported on Bezos’ ownership over their own paper). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post cut its entire sports bureau and nearly annihilated its foreign reporting teams, including its Middle East desk, and reporters and their editors covering Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and others. It closed its Books section, decimated coverage of culture and the Washington, D.C., metro area, and laid off all reporters and editors covering race and ethnicity issues nationally. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The coverage of tech isn’t more important than social, economic, and geopolitical issues. But never before have the people exerting outsized influence on the world’s geopolitics and economy also been so directly responsible for stemming the global flow of information about it. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet even as the world centers on tech and is tied to the GDP growth — or retreat — of its superpowers, tech’s most powerful executives are asking the public to place their attention elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post’s executive editor Matt Murray couched the layoffs as a reboot of sorts aimed at reaching readers and eventually profitability, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the New York Times</a>, which included comments he made to staff. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If anything, today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people’s lives in what is becoming a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,” he reportedly said during a Zoom meeting with staff.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s no secret The Post has lost money and subscribers in recent years, in some cases due to policies crafted or backed by Bezos. For instance, his directive to end presidential endorsements by The Post’s editorial board, axing a drafted piece backing Kamala Harris, reportedly led to “hundreds of thousands” of canceled subscriptions, per the New York Times. It reportedly suffered $100 million in losses in 2024, in part because of the cancellations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its web traffic has also <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-sad-and-self-inflicted-decline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declined</a>. Semafor <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/01/12/2025/letter-from-la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that daily visits were down to around 3 million by the middle of 2024, from 22.5 million in January 2021.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post cut its staff from 1,000 to under 800 last spring, with CEO Will Lewis calling out the $100 million loss from the previous year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The layoffs at The Post, of course, don’t exist in a vacuum. The media industry, and not just legacy players, has been plagued by a fragmented audience and changes to Google Search algorithms that have directed readers away from news outlets and toward its own AI-generated answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The size, scope, and location of those cuts merit scrutiny, however — particularly considering the shift in media ownership over the past 15 years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bezos’ acquisition of the Post in 2013 for $250 million was met with a mix of skepticism and hope from weary journalists who had experienced consolidation, layoffs, and the growing pains of moving from a print-only to digital-dominant media industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His acquisition became part of a broader trend at the time in which billionaires, many with backgrounds in tech, snapped up beleaguered media organizations well worn from the previous go public-private equity cycle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few years after Bezos bought The Post, Laurene Powell Jobs purchased The Atlantic, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time Inc., and pharmaceutical executive Patrick Soon-Shiong acquired the Los Angeles Times. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bezos, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-apologizes-for-saying-national-guard-troops-needed-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benioff</a> and Soon-Shiong (who also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/media/la-times-editor-quits-patrick-soon-shiong-endorsement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blocked</a> his paper’s endorsement of Harris), moved closer to Trump after he won the 2024 election. His spaceflight company Blue Origin relies on <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-ula-expected-clinch-multibillion-dollar-contract-key-pentagon-launch-2025-04-04/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">federal contracts</a>, and Amazon had faced increased scrutiny under previous administrations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lewis was reportedly not present to oversee the staff cuts and changes at The Post (Murray <a href=\"https://x.com/jeremymbarr/status/2019204813574271228\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Fox News</a> that the CEO “had a lot of things to tend to today”). Nor was Bezos. As his newspaper prepared to cut one-third of its staff, Bezos <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/hegseth-sees-plenty-of-winning-for-bezos-s-blue-origin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spent Monday with</a> Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in Florida, leading him on a tour of Blue Origin’s facilities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Less than 48 hours later, The Washington Post would lay off the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aaron-gregg-766bb125_i-was-laid-off-from-the-washington-post-today-activity-7424941320009601025-qoZv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">journalist</a> who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/13/blue-origin-layoffs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> on Blue Origin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The darkness, it seems, is creeping in. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
