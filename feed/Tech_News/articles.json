The team recently announced the launch of their new app, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://acmeweather.com/\">Acme Weather</a>, which they claim offers a better and more reliable forecast than the one they had at Dark Sky. The app will also offer a range of unique weather notifications, including fun ones like alerts about rainbows and beautiful sunsets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike typical weather apps, Acme Weather’s forecast is supplemented with a range of alternate predictions for better accuracy. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

wrong — it’s the weather, right? It’s one of the hardest things to predict,” Grossman told TechCrunch via a telephone interview. “And our biggest pet peeve with a lot of weather apps is you just get their best guess, and you don’t know how certain they are.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Having an understanding of the alternatives helps people plan for big events, he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I find it most useful for winter storms, where, maybe the storm starts out in the morning, and you’re going to get snow, but maybe there’s also a possibility it holds out a little bit later — to the afternoon — in which case it’s rain,” Gross explained. “Being able to just see that right there on the timeline just gives you this intuitive sense of whether, do all the models agree, and you’re getting snow? Or do half of them say snow and half of them say rain?”,” he says.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This type of weather data could make for a valuable product, not just for consumers, but for other developers, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Dark Sky, the team had offered its weather API to developers for a fee. After being acquired by Apple, the team worked on creating <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/\">WeatherKit</a>, the developer toolkit that provides access to Apple’s weather data on a subscription basis. Grossman said the team hasn’t yet decided if a developer API will be a part of Acme Weather’s offering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Acme Weather is a $25 per year consumer app, with a two-week free trial. This helps to cover the costs involved with pulling in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://acmeweather.com/datasources\">different weather models and resources</a>, which can be expensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of our time has been spent on building our own forecast — our own data provider, in a way. And this lets us do things like build multiple forecasts…[and] create any map we want, rather than having to rely on a third-party map provider,” Grossman noted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, the app offers a range of maps, like radar, lightning, rain and snow totals, as well as wind, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and hurricane tracks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another feature, Community Reports, lets users share information about their current conditions to improve the app’s real-time weather reporting. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095737\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=300,249 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=768,637 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=680,564 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=1200,995 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=1280,1062 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=430,357 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=720,597 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=900,747 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=800,664 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=668,554 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=452,375 452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=744,617 744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=640,531 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/community_35b004.png?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Dark Sky had become a favorite weather app because of its uncanny ability to predict when it would begin raining in your location, Acme Weather aims to improve on this and even have some fun. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app includes built-in notifications for typical things, like rain, nearby lightning, community reports, government-issued severe weather alerts, and more.

OpenAI sent a memo to House lawmakers earlier this month accusing DeepSeek of using distillation to mimic its products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepSeek first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape/\">made waves</a> a year ago when it released its open-source R1 reasoning model that nearly matched American frontier labs in performance at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is expected to soon release DeepSeek V4, its latest model, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability\">reportedly</a> can outperform Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in coding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scale of each attack differed in scope. Anthropic tracked more than 150,000 exchanges from DeepSeek that seemed aimed at improving foundational logic and alignment, specifically around censor-ship safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moonshot AI had more than 3.4 million exchanges targeting agentic reasoning and tool use, coding and data analysis, computer-use agent development, and computer vision. Last month, the firm <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/chinas-moonshot-releases-a-new-open-source-model-kimi-k2-5-and-a-coding-agent/\">released</a> a new open source model Kimi K2.5 and a coding agent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MiniMax’s 13 million exchanges targeted agentic coding and tool use and orchestration. Anthropic said it was able to observe MiniMax in action as it redirected nearly half its traffic to siphon capabilities from the latest Claude model when it was launched. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says it will continue to invest in defenses that make distillation attacks harder to execute and easier to identify, but is calling on “a coordinated response across the AI industry, cloud providers, and policymakers.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The distillation attacks come at a time when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/a-timeline-of-the-u-s-semiconductor-market-in-2025/\">American chip exports</a> to China are still hotly debated. Last month, the Trump administration formally allowed U.S. companies like Nvidia to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/department-of-commerce-may-approve-nvidia-h200-chip-exports-to-china/\">export advanced AI chips </a>(like the H200) to China. Critics have argued that this loosening of export controls increases China’s AI computing capacity at a critical time in the global race for AI dominance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says that the scale of extraction DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot performed “requires access to advanced chips.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,” per Anthropic’s blog. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/crowdstrikes-former-cto-on-cyber-rivalries-and-how-automation-can-undermine-security-for-early-stage-startups/\">Dmitri Alperovitch</a>, chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think-tank and co-founder of CrowdStrike, told TechCrunch he’s not surprised to see these attacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s been clear for a while now that part of the reason for the rapid progress of Chinese AI models has been theft via distillation of US frontier models. Now we know this for a fact,” Alperovitch said. “This should give us even more compelling reasons to refuse to sell any AI chips to any of these [companies]<strong>,</strong> which would only advantage them further.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic also said distillation doesn’t only threaten to undercut American AI dominance, but could also create national security risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anthropic and other U.S. companies build systems that prevent state and non-state actors from using AI to, for example, develop bioweapons or carry out malicious cyber activities,” reads Anthropic’s blog post. “Models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain those safeguards, meaning that dangerous capabilities can proliferate with many protections stripped out entirely.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic pointed to authoritarian governments deploying frontier AI for things like “offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance,” a risk that is multiplied if those models are open-sourced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot for comment. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Uber has backed many of these companies — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/uber-makes-multi-million-dollar-investment-in-lucid-nuro-to-build-robotaxi-service/\">Lucid and Nuro</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/waabi-raises-1b-and-expands-into-robotaxis-with-uber/\">Waabi</a>, and China’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/uber-invests-100m-in-weride-to-fuel-robotaxi-expansion-across-15-more-cities/\">WeRide</a> — invested $100 million to build fast-charging, autonomous-vehicle charging stations, and even launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/uber-launches-an-av-labs-division-to-gather-driving-data-for-robotaxi-partners/\">Uber AV Labs</a>, a specialized engineering team that will gather data for robotaxi partners. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has made the partnerships and investments; now it wants to make itself indispensable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AV tech teams should be able to focus on what they do best: building software that can safely power an autonomous world,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s global head of autonomous mobility and delivery, who will be leading the initiative. The idea, he said, is to add “operational depth wherever they need it,” including demand generation, rider experience, customer support, or managing the day-to-day fleet operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end goal is to help these companies reduce their costs per mile and increase the speed to market. Uber said it plans to help these partners scale robotaxi deployments to <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/J3LNCnGAzAhnrM2GcEuLIJqIJU?domain=s23.q4cdn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 15 cities by the end of this year</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s going to determine the success or failure of autonomous in the world is whether it can be commercialized, and Uber is going to be the thing that makes autonomy commercially viable,” Uber President and COO Andrew MacDonald said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Uber that means handling infrastructure like training data and mapping, fleet financing, regulatory services, and managing how robotaxis and other AVs navigate complex events and venues. The company said it is using a fleet of specially equipped Lucid vehicles to collect data that can be shared with partners so they can train their AI systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new division also plans to tackle user experience including customer support. Notably, Uber wants to take over fleet management, which would include remote assistance — an issue that recently received attention from federal lawmakers over concerns <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/techcrunch-mobility-waymo-makes-its-defense/\">Waymo uses workers overseas</a>. Fleet management would also cover insurance and employing the humans who might need to support these AVs when they’re out in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber’s move is both existential and opportunistic. The company sold its in-house AV development unit known as Uber ATG in 2020, following two years of internal struggles and pressure after one of its test vehicles killed a pedestrian. (Uber sold off the division in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">complex deal with Aurora</a>.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has tried to shore up its position through partnerships and investments. And there have been plenty. Uber and Waymo have a shared robotaxi service in Atlanta and Austin. The company has also locked up partnerships with Chinese firms Baidu, Momenta, and Pony.ai, sidewalk delivery bot companies Cartken, Starship, Serve, and the UK-based automated driving tech startup Wayve, as well as robotaxi developers AVride and Motional, to name a few. It has plans to launch a robotaxi service with Volkswagen in Los Angeles by the end of 2026 — although it won’t be driverless until 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These do provide Uber with some protection, but it doesn’t provide a replacement to any revenue lost if these companies erode its own ride-hailing and food delivery business that is today powered by human drivers. Uber is hoping this new division will. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It gives him a high-level view of how companies are actually using AI models, and what still needs to be done to unleash the potential of agentic AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I spoke with Michael, I was particularly struck by one idea I hadn’t heard before. As he put it, AI models are pushing against three frontiers at once: raw intelligence, response time, and a third quality that has less to do with raw capability than with cost — whether a model can be deployed cheaply enough to run at massive, unpredictable scale. It’s a new way of thinking about model capabilities, and a particularly valuable one for anyone trying to push frontier models in a new direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Why don’t you start by walking us through your experience in AI so far, and what you do at Google?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’ve been in AI for about two years now. I was at Anthropic for a year and a half, I’ve been at Google almost half a year now. I run Vertex AI, Google’s developer platform. Most of our customers are engineers building their own applications. They want access to agentic patterns. They want access to an agentic platform. They want access to the inference of the smartest models in the world. I provide them that, but I don’t provide the applications themselves. That’s for Shopify, Thomson Reuters, and our various customers to provide in their own domains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What drew you to Google?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is I think unique in the world in that we have everything from the interface to the infrastructure layer. We can build data centers. We can buy electricity and build power plants. We have our own chips. We have our own model. We have the inference layer that we control. We have the agentic layer we control. We have APIs for memory, for interleaved code writing. We have agent engine on top of that that ensures compliance and governance. And then we even have the chat interface with Gemini enterprise and Gemini chat for consumers, right? So part of the reason I came here is because I saw Google as uniquely vertically integrated, and that being a strength for us.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>It’s odd because, even with all the differences between companies, it feels like all three of the big labs are really</strong> <strong>close in capabilities. Is it just a race for more intelligence, or is it more complicated than that?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I see three boundaries. Models like Gemini Pro are tuned for raw intelligence. Think about writing code. You just want the best code you can get, doesn’t matter if it takes 45 minutes, because I have to maintain it, I have to put it in production. I just want the best.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s this other boundary with latency. If I’m doing customer support and I need to know how to apply a policy, you need intelligence to apply that policy. Are you allowed to transact a return? Can I upgrade my seat on an airplane? But it doesn’t matter how right you are if it took 45 minutes to get the answer. So for those cases, you want the most intelligent product within that latency budget, because more intelligence no longer matters once that person gets bored and hangs up the phone. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then there’s this last bucket, where somebody like Reddit or Meta wants to moderate the entire internet. They have large budgets, but they can’t take an enterprise risk on something if they don’t know how it scales. They don’t know how many poisonous posts there will be today or tomorrow. So they have to restrict their budget to a model at the highest intelligence they can afford, but in a scalable way to an infinite number of subjects. And for that, cost becomes very, very important.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of the things I’ve been puzzling about is why agentic systems are taking so long to catch on. It feels like the models are there and I’ve seen incredible demos, but we’re not seeing the kind of major changes I would have expected a year ago. What do you think is holding it back?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This technology is basically two years old, and there’s still a lot of missing infrastructure. We don’t have patterns for auditing what the agents are doing. We don’t have patterns for authorization of data to an agent. There are these patterns that are going to require work to put into production. And production is always a trailing indicator of what the technology is capable of. So two years isn’t long enough to see what the intelligence supports in production, and that’s where people are struggling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think it’s moved uniquely quickly in software engineering because it fits nicely in the software development lifecycle. We have a dev environment in which it’s safe to break things, and then we promote from the dev environment to the test environment. The process of writing code at Google requires two people to audit that code and both affirm that it’s good enough to put Google’s brand behind and give to our customers. So we have a lot of those human-in-the-loop processes that make the implementation exceptionally low-risk. But we need to produce those patterns in other places and for other professions.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It has faced criticism for allowing federal authorities access to its massive network of nationwide license plate readers and databases at a time when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are increasingly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/\">relying on data</a> to raid communities as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flock cameras allow authorities to track where people go and when by taking photos of their license plates from thousands of cameras located across the United States. Flock claims it doesn’t share data with ICE directly, but reports show that local police have shared their own access to Flock cameras and its databases with federal authorities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some communities are calling on their cities to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/17/nx-s1-5612825/flock-contracts-canceled-immigration-survillance-concerns\">end their contracts with Flock</a>, others are taking matters into their own hands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merchant reports instances of broken and smashed Flock cameras in La Mesa, California, just weeks after the city council approved the continuation of Flock cameras deployed in the city, despite a clear majority of attendees favoring their shutdown. A <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sdslackers.com/2026/02/16/flock-cameras-destroyed-in-la-mesa-amid-surveillance-backlash/\">local report</a> cited strong opposition to the surveillance technology, with residents raising privacy concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other cases of vandalism have stretched from California and Connecticut, to Illinois and Virginia.

On Monday, the company open sourced an 8-billion-parameter LLM, <a href=\"https://github.com/guidelabs/steerling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Steerling-8B</a>, trained with a new architecture designed to make its actions easily interpretable: Every token produced by the model can be traced back to its origins in the LLM’s training data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That can be as simple as determining the reference materials for facts cited by the model, or as complex as understanding the model’s understanding of humor or gender.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If I have a trillion ways to encode gender, and I encode it in 1 billion of the 1 trillion things that I have, you have to make sure you find all those 1 billion things that I’ve encoded, and then you have to be able to reliably turn that on, turn them off,” Adebayo told TechCrunch. “You can do it with current models, but it’s very fragile … It’s sort of one of the holy grail questions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adebayo began this work while earning his PhD at MIT, co-authoring a widely cited <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03292\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2018 paper</a> that showed existing methods of understanding deep learning models were not reliable. That work ultimately led to the creation of a new way of building LLMs: Developers insert a concept layer in the model that buckets data into traceable categories. This requires more up-front data annotation, but by using other AI models to help, they were able to train this model as their largest proof of concept yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The kind of interpretability people do is … neuroscience on a model, and we flip that,” Adebayo said. “What we do is actually engineer the model from the ground up so that you don’t need to do neuroscience.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095647\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png 1648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=768,451 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=680,399 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=1200,705 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=1280,752 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=430,253 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=720,423 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=900,529 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=800,470 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=1536,902 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=668,392 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=638,375 638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=1050,617 1050w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=708,416 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Guide-Labs-Architecture.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Guide Labs</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One concern with this approach is that it might eliminate some of the emergent behaviors that make LLMs so intriguing: Their ability to generalize in new ways about things they haven’t been trained on yet. Adebayo says that still happens in his company’s model: His team tracks what they call “discovered concepts” that the model discovered on its own, like quantum computing.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adebayo argues this interpretable architecture will be something everyone needs. For consumer-facing LLMs, these techniques should allow model builders to do things like block the use of copyrighted materials, or better control outputs around subjects like violence or drug abuse. Regulated industries will require more controllable LLMs — for example, in finance — where a model evaluating loan applicants needs to consider things like financial records but not race. There’s also a need for interpretability in scientific work, another area where Guide Labs has developed technology. Protein folding has been a big success for deep learning models, but scientists need more insight into why their software figured out promising combinations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This model demonstrates that training interpretable models is no longer a sort of science; it’s now an engineering problem,” Adebayo said. “We figured out the science and we can scale them, and there is no reason why this kind of model wouldn’t match the performance of the frontier level models,” which have many more parameters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Guide Labs says that Steerling-8B can achieve 90% of the capability of existing models, but uses less training data, thanks to its novel architecture. The next step for the company, which emerged from Y Combinator and raised a $9 million seed round from Initialized Capital in November 2024, is to build a larger model and begin offering API and agentic access to users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way we’re currently training models is super primitive, and so democratizing inherent interpretability is actually going to be a long-term good thing for our role within the human race,” Adebayo told TechCrunch. “As we’re going after these models that are going to be super intelligent, you don’t want something to be making decisions on your behalf that’s sort of mysterious to you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Instead of searching for individual songs or artists, users can describe the vibe, scenario, or inspiration they want, and Spotify will take care of the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To access the feature, users tap “Create” and then select “Prompted Playlist,” then enter any prompt in English. The feature is designed to interpret themes including moods, aesthetics, and even memories. Prompts can be as broad or specific as the user wants, referencing musical eras, genres, activities, lyrics, instruments, or even requesting a playlist inspired by a TV show, movie, or personal milestone. Users can also specify whether they want the playlist to include mostly new music or just music from their library in the prompt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once a prompt is submitted, Spotify’s AI generates a customized playlist tailored to the request. The system draws on the user’s listening history and incorporates current music and cultural trends. Plus, each song comes with a short explanation that offers insight into why it was chosen for that particular playlist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can refine their playlists by adjusting their prompts or starting over. For those whose musical tastes constantly evolve, playlists can be scheduled to automatically refresh on a daily or weekly basis.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095587\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Meet-My-New-Favourite-Artist.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because this is still in beta, Spotify noted that there might be changes as the company gets feedback, and that there are currently usage limits in place.

The move will see IQM join the growing cohort of quantum computing companies listed on U.S. stock markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2018 as a spinout from Finland’s Aalto University and VTT Technical Research, IQM commercializes both on-premises full-stack quantum computers and a cloud platform to access its systems, with clients including academic and industrial labs around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Public quantum companies <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-13/infleqtion-s-public-debut-to-test-quantum-frenzy-s-staying-power\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have seen their stocks surge in recent months</a>, fueled by signals from governments and Big Tech that the “quantum advantage” over regular supercomputers may soon be within reach. This has led believers to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/quantonations-double-sized-second-fund-shows-quantum-still-has-believers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">double down</a>, with the conviction that the field will soon have lucrative real-life applications in life sciences, new materials, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going public will provide IQM with an extended runway to support its commercial plans. The company reported $35 million in 2025 revenue and over $100 million in bookings. With the close of this transaction, its cash position will exceed $450 million. But the company could also see its market cap trend upward or downward, depending on how investor appetite for quantum stocks has evolved when it begins trading.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With industrial applications still years away, questions remain as to whether the current quantum frenzy will last. These questions arise to an even greater extent because most of these companies went public via SPACs — a route that is faster than a traditional IPO, but that peaked in 2021 and left many investors nursing losses in its wake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite this sour aftertaste, quantum SPACs are back in fashion. Earlier this month, neutral-atom quantum company Infleqtion <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-17/quantum-firm-infleqtion-jumps-in-debut-after-klein-led-spac-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">jumped in its debut</a> on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) via a SPAC, with Canadian firm Xanadu Quantum Technologies planning to go public via a SPAC on the Nasdaq by the end of March. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, IQM is following in their footsteps but considers entering the public markets on both a U.S. and Nordic exchange. In the U.S., it may go public either on the Nasdaq or on the NYSE — the blank check company, in its case, is a Nasdaq-listed vehicle, Real Asset Acquisition Corp., but as a foreign company, it will list American Depositary Shares, and the listing is subject to approval.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iqm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Crunchbase</a>, IQM has raised some $569.1 million to date.

The backdoor allowed the hackers to gain access to 119 other unnamed organizations that used the company’s same VPN product.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mandiant was reportedly aware of the breaches as well, alerting Ivanti that hackers had exploited the bug to breach European and U.S. military contractors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The previously unreported breach is the latest example of how acquisitions, layoffs, and cost-cutting driven by private equity firms helped to compromise the quality and security of Ivanti’s most critical technologies. After private investment giant Clearlake Capital Group acquired Ivanti in 2017, Bloomberg reported rounds of cuts — particularly in 2022 — affecting employees who had deep institutional knowledge of the company’s products and their security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ivanti’s spokesperson Carrie Laudie disputed Bloomberg’s reporting and said there was “never a backdoor planted by hackers in Connect Secure.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mandiant did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg’s findings echo earlier reporting into rival provider of remote access tools, Citrix, which had <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/company-created-by-citrix-tibco-merger-confirms-it-has-laid-off-15-of-staff/#!\">large-scale layoffs</a> following a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/31/citrix-to-be-acquired-by-vista-and-evergreen-elliott-in-a-16-5b-all-cash-deal-will-be-merged-with-tibco-to-create-saas-powerhouse/\">2022 deal</a> by Elliott Investment Management and Vista Equity Partners to buy the company. Like Ivanti, Citrix has been mired by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/citrix-bleed-critical-bug-ransomware-mass-cyberattacks/\">cybersecurity incidents</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/cisa-confirms-hackers-are-actively-exploiting-critical-citrix-bleed-2-bug/\">critical flaws</a> in recent years. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ivanti’s VPN products have been the cause of at least two other major attacks since. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early 2024, U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/cisa-federal-agencies-disconnect-ivanti-vpn/\">ordered all federal agencies to disconnect</a> their Ivanti VPN appliances within two days because hackers were actively exploiting vulnerabilities that were unknown to Ivanti at the time.

The scenario imagines a report from two years in the future, in which unemployment has doubled, and the total value of the stock market has fallen by more than a third. As the report puts it:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI capabilities improved, companies needed fewer workers, white collar layoffs increased, displaced workers spent less, margin pressure pushed firms to invest more in AI, AI capabilities improved…</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a negative feedback loop with no natural brake…The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a new kind of bear case, focused not on Skynet-style misalignment but on the gradual unspooling of the economy itself. In particular, the Citrini scenario looks at the implications of integrating AI agents into the economy at large, and what it would mean when outside contractors get replaced by cheaper in-house AI. It’s similar to the <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/is-saas-dead-rethinking-the-future-of-software-in-the-age-of-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Death of SaaS</a> scenario, but Citrini goes further, implicating any business model that involves optimizing transactions between companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As you might expect, the report is causing <a href=\"https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2025894184817684633\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">quite</a> a <a href=\"https://x.com/Citrini7/status/2025804144070561907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stir</a> online. Not everyone is buying it — even Citrini describes it as more of a scenario than a prediction — but it’s not so easy to name the specific point where you think the scenario goes wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Personally, I’m not sure companies are ready to hand off purchasing decisions to AI agents, no matter how smart they are. But in Citrini’s scenario, most of the impacted decisions have already been handed off to third-party contractors, so it’s not quite as implausible as it seems.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

It’s unclear whether he’s bluffing — replacing Anthropic would be a significant undertaking.

On Android, the interface is a bit different, as you can access the dictionary through a floating bubble. You can hold the bubble and dictate, or press once to start, and then press the close button to stop the process. Just like on other platforms, in addition to dictation, the app cleans up the filter words and also formats the text based on the context of the app and spoken content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Android finally gave us the freedom to build the voice experience we always wanted. Only when the platform gets out of the way can we truly expect voice to replace typing on mobile,” Tanay Kothari, co-founder and CEO of the startup, said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app can support translation in over 100 languages and can work across other apps. Along with the Android app release, Wispr Flow said that it has done an infrastructure rewrite that makes dictation 30% faster than before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there are tons of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/the-best-ai-powered-dictation-apps-of-2025/\">AI-powered dictation apps available on desktop and iOS</a>, Wispr Flow is one of the few available on Android with this launch, besides Typeless, which launched <a href=\"https://x.com/huang_song_/status/2013522407055860072\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an app for the platform last month</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the company has also released a new model for Hinglish, a mix of Hindi and English, for people in India who speak in mix-coded way. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re someone like me, English and Hindi weave together when I’m chatting with family and colleagues back home.

So then does the pool of successful creators just simply get smaller? Or will something else happen, technologically speaking, or a different medium that will allow them to find an audience to make money off of?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> [The news] led our colleague Lauren to do <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/youtubers-arent-relying-on-ad-revenue-anymore-heres-how-some-are-diversifying/\">this great piece</a> talking about the creator business model in general, and this sense that they aren’t just relying on ad revenue anymore. I think it’s still a pretty big part of their business, but she broke down a number of the most popular YouTubers and noted that each of them is expanding — usually into e-commerce, but also into other revenue streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MrBeast, for example, actually has this line of food products, including chocolate, that is making hundreds of millions of dollars and it was actually profitable for him in 2024, whereas his media business was losing money. All that was pretty wild to me.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten: </strong>If MrBeast can’t be profitable with his media company, who can? To me, that was a stunning stat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I am not surprised that the whole ad revenue biz game is not working out necessarily for creators and influencers because it’s just reached a saturation point. I guess my big question is, what’s the next saturation point? Not all of these folks can go out and spin off products. So then does the pool of successful creators just simply get smaller? Or will something else happen, technologically speaking, or a different medium that will allow them to find an audience to make money off of?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rebecca: </strong>It’s interesting, there’s a lot of ways you can think about what else could happen, right? Maybe they’ll create digital twins of themselves and put their digital twins into a bunch of different situations that can make them [other kinds of] money.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But again, going back to this not being surprising, these people are now celebrities, right? Someone told me on the phone recently that a lot of [the] younger generation, they don’t know our celebrities, they know TikTok celebrities. And we’ve seen celebrities for years pass off products and make money off of them, right? I used to watch Rachel [Ray], she was a celebrity chef and she sold her EVOO or her olive oil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/how-slow-ventures-is-giving-the-creator-economy-a-rebrand/\">We had Slow Ventures on [Equity] sometime last year</a>. They have a creator fund and basically what they’re doing is they’ve raised a VC fund to essentially back creators with their businesses, if they have maybe a niche following, maybe they’re really into woodworking and here’s their collection of chisels, I don’t know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think it’s an interesting path forward and it’s something that we see as journalists: How do we also try to be creators and make a brand of ourselves that we could diversify our revenue. It sounds horrible to say it out loud like that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> I’m smiling, but it’s the smile of somebody whose soul is slowly turning into ash inside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So we took a break from talking about AI, but I will obligatorily bring AI back into the conversation. Obviously one of the other related developments over the past week or so is that ByteDance, which is the Chinese company that launched TikTok and is still an investor — we won’t get into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/heres-whats-you-should-know-about-the-us-tiktok-deal/\">all of that</a> — they launched a new version of their model, Seedance 2.0, which at least initially was primarily only available to Chinese users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But you started to see people posting videos generated by Seedance, including a viral video of Brad Pitt fighting Tom Cruise. That prompted both this general conversation of: Is Hollywood doomed? And then more concretely, a bunch of Hollywood studios, including Netflix, sending ByteDance letters being like, “You cannot do this, you’re basically allowing all your users to generate videos using all of our IP, all of our movie stars.” And for a couple of days, there was no response at all from ByteDance, but then they did say, “Sorry, sorry, sorry, for some reason we launched this without any real guardrails, but we’re gonna do better in the future.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten:</strong> So the timing of this is just perfect because I happen to be editing a story right now that Rebecca wrote. It has nothing to do with Seedance, but it does have to do with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/20/ais-promise-to-indie-filmmakers-faster-cheaper-lonelier/\">AI and filmmaking</a>. So I’m going to give a future props to Rebecca for being timely about that. Rebecca, I know you have a lot to say on that, besides that Hollywood is upset. Is it more complicated than that?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yeah, definitely. I mean, tying this back to the creators thing, I think that a lot of people are going to be using these tools to produce all kinds of content and we’re just going to be absolutely flooded. And that’s going to be intense. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But when we talk about whether it’s creating films or ads or just content in general using AI video tools, I think there’s this tension between one, this is going to produce a whole lot of low-effort slop versus two, it could also democratize access for a lot of people who don’t have funds or budgets or teams to share a lot of the stories that they want to tell. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And also, if you’re a small business and you want to create a little shampoo ad — to be on the nose about it, because there’s a shampoo ad that’s going viral — or you sell coffee and you want to make a little ad for it, [this] could give you the tools to do that. Is that a bad thing? Is it not a bad thing? Do we need more content in the world? There’s a few avenues to walk down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten:</strong> Is it a bad thing, Anthony?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> In terms of the creator side of it, my general feeling is [that] the response to a lot of this kind of slop — frankly, a lot of it <em>is</em> slop, and I think that’s going to continue to be the case — is going to be this valuing of authenticity. And so there is the opportunity for these big creators is be less about the idea of like, “I have digital twins of myself,” but [instead,] “No, I’m the real MrBeast, not the digital simulacra wandering around.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And I think it’s also telling that — of course, every social network has ups and downs, but that OpenAI’s Sora, from what I understand, had skyrocketed at the beginning and then has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/openais-sora-app-is-struggling-after-its-stellar-launch/\">struggling to hold on to users</a> more recently, because there is a certain emptiness to the experience when you just feel like there’s not an authentic human being on the other side. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But I think it’s also going to make the landscape much more challenging, both for the established creators to monetize […] and then I think it’s going to be especially hard for new creators because there’s just going to be so much more stuff. Trying to actually break out is going to become super difficult.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The creator economy's ad revenue problem and India's AI ambitions | Equity Podcast\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Fa3izZJnaY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For nearly three decades, Bill Gurley has been one of the most influential voices in Silicon Valley — a general partner at Benchmark whose early bets on companies like Uber, Zillow, and Stitch Fix helped define what modern venture capital looks like. Now, having moved to Austin and stepped back from active investing, the native Texan is channeling that same pattern-recognition instinct into something different: a book, a foundation, and a policy institute aimed at problems he thinks he can actually help solve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The book is “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Runnin-Down-Dream-Thrive-Actually/dp/0593799666\">Runnin’ Down a Dream</a>” — a nod to Tom Petty and also an argument that following your passion isn’t just romanticized career advice but a true competitive strategy, one that becomes only more urgent as AI rapidly reshapes the workforce. The foundation, which he’s calling the Running Down a Dream Foundation, will award 100 grants of $5,000 a year to people who need a financial cushion to make a leap they’ve been afraid to take.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We caught up with Gurley to talk about all of it — including what he makes of the somewhat surreal reality that several of his former peers in tech now hold enormous sway in Washington, why he thinks <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the 996 grind culture</a> many young founders have adopted is less alarming than it sounds, and what AI really means for your career. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Our full conversation with Gurley drops Tuesday on TC’s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/76SeToo8Rxj8hRTE0iQwWZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">StrictlyVC Download</a> podcast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Why write this book?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I went through a phase where I was reading a lot of biographies — people from very different fields, different time windows — and I started noticing patterns the way I would notice patterns in a market evolving. I wrote them down. A couple years later I got invited to speak at the University of Texas, dusted off the notes, built a presentation. They posted it on YouTube, and James Clear — who wrote “Atomic Habits” — noticed and posted about it. That’s what got me thinking about a book. And when I went through my own process of moving away from venture and thinking about what I wanted to do next, it became obvious I didn’t want to write about VC or Uber or any of that. I wanted to do something that could have a bigger mission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Your research with Wharton found that roughly 60% of people would do things differently if they could start their careers over. That shocked you. Why? </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When we first ran it as a SurveyMonkey poll we got seven out of 10. When we did it more rigorously with Wharton, we got six out of 10. One of the things that strikes me is that we have a phrase in the book — life is a use it or lose it proposition — and when you’re young, it’s just hard to have that framing. It’s hard to fast-forward through all of your time and recognize how precious it is. Daniel Pink has done a lot of work on what he calls regrets of inaction — the thing that weighs on people most as they get older is the thing they didn’t try, the stone left unturned. That holds across multiple geographies and cultures. And I think a lot of well-intentioned parents feel more responsibility to create economic stability for their kids than to encourage them to truly explore their passion. Especially with AI out there, that may not have been the right call.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Exploring your passion sounds like easier advice for people who have financial runway. What do you say to someone working paycheck to paycheck?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few things. First, the book profiles people who started on the very bottom rung and climbed to the top — [celebrity hairstylist and entrepreneur] Jen Atkins moved to LA with $200 in her pocket. There’s nothing in the book that says you need to start anywhere other than right at the beginning. Second, if you’re living paycheck to paycheck, I wouldn’t encourage you to quit. I’d encourage you to use your free time to build a little document on your phone about what your thing might be. Learn. Prepare to jump before you jump. And third — this is why I’m launching the foundation. The last page of the book talks about it: We’re going to give 100 grants a year of $5,000 to people who are in exactly that position, who can convince us in an application that they’ve thought long and hard about where they want to go but need a little help getting there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>You’ve been outspoken for years about regulatory capture — the idea that big companies use regulation to entrench themselves.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I gave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9cO3-MLHOM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">speech</a> on regulatory capture a few years back — it was at the All-In Summit — and at the time I said I had a fear that the AI companies would try to use regulation to protect themselves. I think that’s happening now. The flip side is that there are legitimate questions: Jonathan Haidt’s book “Anxious Generation” has been on the bestseller list for almost two years, arguing social media has been really bad for children, with academic research to back it up. People would say we should have gotten in front of social media and need to do it with AI. The problem is that the people begging for regulation the most in AI are the actual companies themselves, and that makes me skeptical. There’s also the global dimension — if U.S. AI gets entangled in state-by-state regulation and Chinese models are running free, we’re going to paint ourselves in red tape. I always ask people: What are your favorite five regulations of all time, and how were they successful? Do you have any confidence that people at the state level in a random state know how to write good AI regulation that will actually work?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>It’s a little surreal that several prominent figures from your world now hold enormous influence in Washington. What do you make of that?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s very ironic. If you go back and watch that regulatory capture talk, who would have thought a few years later David Sacks would actually be [special advisor for AI and crypto in the White House]?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Back in 2018, Mike Moritz of Sequoia wrote in the FT that Americans would lose to China if they didn’t start <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42daca9e-facc-11e7-9bfc-052cbba03425\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">working harder</a>. It was controversial at the time, but a lot of young founders here seem to have since embraced a punishing work culture — the 996 ethos. What are your thoughts about what’s happening?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I kind of love it, honestly. I think Silicon Valley got really lazy during COVID — people weren’t coming into the office, the culture got soft in a way I hadn’t seen in all my years there. And I’ve been to China six times. I know what Michael Moritz was describing when he said we’re going to lose not because they’re smarter but because they have a better work ethic. But here’s the thing: If you study successful people across a lot of fields, we think it’s wonderful when an athlete practices 12 hours a day or when an artist works obsessively on their craft. Nobody says Jordan didn’t have work-life balance. We just don’t extend the same logic to building a company. If those founders love what they’re doing that much, and they feel like this is the moment to go hard, that’s actually precisely the point of the book: Find the thing that makes you feel that way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>You talk about mentorship in the book. What makes a great mentor relationship and how do people find one?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The number one thing is to get out of your head this idea that gets passed around in the self-help world: “go get a mentor,” and everyone runs out and cold calls someone that’s ridiculously too high and unachievable, and it doesn’t work. For all those people who are really out of reach right now, I call them aspirational mentors — create a persona of them, just like I was talking about with the dream job folder. Get clips of all the books they’ve written, podcasts they’ve done, interviews they’ve done, and study them. You can learn a lot from people without talking to them directly, especially in the modern age. And then for your real mentors, go two levels down from where you thought you were going to aim. Discover somebody — tools like LinkedIn make this so easy — and be the first person to ever call them and ask them to be a mentor, because they’ll be flattered. They’ll be flattered that you knew who they were. Imagine anyone getting their first call to be a mentor. It’s a great feeling. You’re going to have way more success with that interaction than shooting too high.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’ll tell you a funny story: I started getting so many calls from people who wanted to break into venture that I wrote a three-page PDF called “So You Want to Be a VC,” and hidden in the third page was basically — go do X, go do Y, go do Z, come back and tell me how that went. The number of people that actually ended up talking to me after getting that document was a fraction of the number I sent it to. It’s funny how much it thinned when you gave them a little homework to do.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>You started working on this book before the impacts of AI became clearer. Does that at all change how people should think about their careers?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’re following the traditional path — going through the career center at your university, signing up on a list, waiting for a recruiter to sit through 30 people in 20-minute slots — you look like a cog. You look mass-produced. For that group, AI looks frightening, and maybe it should. But if you are blazing your own trail, using the techniques in the book, becoming what I call a candidate of one — someone whose path looks completely unique because you’ve built it intentionally — then every tool in this book is amplified by AI. Learning has never been easier than right now, in the entire history of the world. If you’re running toward it, if you’re becoming the most AI-aware person in your field, this thing is nothing but a superpower.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And yet, investor appetite for companies pursuing the elusive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">quantum advantage</a> hasn’t dwindled — it has increased.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.quantonation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Quantonation Ventures</a>, a venture firm investing in quantum and physics-based startups, has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-18/novo-holdings-acs-back-220-million-quantonation-ventures-fund?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTM5NjQ0MCwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMDAxMjQwLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQUxaWkZLSzNOWUUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI4MjUwQUY0RTJFNTY0QTIyODQ3NDlDOTBDQjVCMTU5OSJ9.LPec1UM_1NLC13VCl3Rm__EnwyUjyTkYfaS_Govyxoc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closed its oversubscribed second fund at €220 million</a>, or approximately $260 million. That’s more than twice the size of its inaugural fund, and comes in addition to other signals that the quantum winter isn’t coming yet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some warned that too much quantum hype and not enough tangible outcomes would eventually cause funding to collapse, the opposite has happened. Take the prediction that quantum will eventually crack modern encryption: that moment has no clear timeline, and yet governments have joined Big Tech in the race.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the years since Quantonation’s launch in 2018, the quantum technology sector has become less incipient, with both technological breakthroughs and early demand from academic and industrial labs. As a result, there has also been “a shift in the types of investment opportunities that are available” to its second fund, Quantonation partner Will Zeng told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One example is what Zeng describes as the “picks and shovels” opportunity, with companies developing technologies that support the quantum industry. He cited the example of Dutch startup Qblox, a long-bootstrapped company that was selling quantum control hardware and software to Quantonation portfolio companies before the VC firm <a href=\"https://qblox.com/newsroom/qblox-secures-series-a-funding-quantum-control-stack-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">co-led its Series A</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This growing ecosystem also explains why backers are doubling down on Quantonation, and why other dedicated quantum funds such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/quantum-vc-qdnl-hits-e25m-first-close-on-new-fund/\">QDNL</a> and <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/10/02/denmark-launches-the-worlds-largest-quantum-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">55 North</a> have emerged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“VCs recognize that this is not an easy area to invest in at the early stage. The technology is very specific and complex, the markets are often new, and the teams as well,” Zeng said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s thesis is to invest early to capture more value; but a handful of quantum companies have already gone public, and their shares have surged in recent months. According to Bloomberg, this “quantum frenzy” is partly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-13/infleqtion-s-public-debut-to-test-quantum-frenzy-s-staying-power\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stocked</a> by Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gtc-paris-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declared</a> in June 2025 that “quantum computing is reaching an inflection point.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the fact that quantum chips have yet to outperform classical computers outside of purpose-built benchmarks, consensus is growing that real-life applications are only a few years away, from life sciences to new materials. That’s in part thanks to advancements in error correction — the ability to fix the mistakes that quantum systems are prone to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google’s Willow chip</a> was a landmark for error correction in 2024, but no architecture has won yet, and smaller players are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/meet-the-companies-racing-to-build-quantum-chips/\">still in the race</a>. Zeng noted that a surprising number of companies have entered <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/quantum-benchmarking-initiative\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative</a>. He also believes that beyond the public market excitement, “there are more exciting technologies that are currently private.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Quantonation, those private opportunities span a wider canvas than quantum chips alone. Fund two has already invested in 12 startups, with a target portfolio of around 25, covering not just the software and industrial layers needed to make quantum advantage real, but also adjacent physics-based technologies such as photonics and lasers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This expanded thesis is backed by investors old and new. According to the firm, major investors from its first vintage, including Singapore’s Vertex Holdings and Bpifrance’s Fonds National d’Amorçage 2, have returned for the second fund, with new limited partners including the European Investment Fund, Grupo ACS, Novo Holdings, Planet First Partners, and Toshiba.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quantonation’s geographic scope is equally international. With dual headquarters in Paris and New York City, the firm has backed French quantum companies including Pasqal and Quandela, but also placed bets in Asia and North America — and will continue doing so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a lot of the areas we invest in, there’s not yet a clear regional winner, […] and a lot of the research has come from universities in many places,” Zeng said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted,’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116111073840858395\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trump posted on his social network Truth Social</a>, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what???”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s post also includes a screenshot of a post from far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Rice’s comments and claiming, “The Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would result in a streaming monopoly, which the Obamas will have a significant stake in” due to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/obama-netflix-deal/\">the deal between Netflix and the Obamas’ production company Higher Ground</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Trump’s post does not mention specific consequences, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/what-to-know-about-netflixs-landmark-acquisition-of-warner-bros/\">Netflix’s massive Warner Bros. acquisition</a> will need to be approved by federal regulators. The streaming company’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/07/netflix-co-ceo-reportedly-discussed-warner-bros-deal-with-trump/\">reportedly met with Trump</a> before the deal was announced, with Trump subsequently saying that Netflix is a “great company […] but it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last fall, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/27/trump-demands-microsoft-fire-global-affairs-head-lisa-monaco/\">Trump published a similar post demanding that Microsoft fire its president of global affairs Lisa Monaco</a>, who was also targeted by Loomer. Monaco is still at Microsoft.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
