Even with functionality similar to that found in ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, Julius has carved out its own niche. The company said it has more than two million users and generates more than 10 million visualizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The easiest way to use Julius is to just talk to it,” Julius AI founder Rahul Sonwalkar told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “You can talk to the AI like you would talk to an analyst on your team, and the AI, like a human would go, run the code and do the analysis for you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Questions that Julius can answer and present in a chart include: “Can you visualize how revenue and net income correlate for different industries in China versus US?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Julius’ specialization in data science even caught the eye of Harvard Business School (HBS) professor Iavor Bojinov last year. Bojinov was so impressed he asked Sonwalkar to modify Julius specifically for HBS’ new required course called <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/news/articles/Pages/mba-ai-course.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Data Science and AI for Leaders</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People told us you’re not going to succeed,” Sonwalkar said about building a product that’s similar to features available from the foundational model companies.  “What we found was that being focused on a use case is really important.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While going through YC, Sonwalkar also masterminded a viral prank. The morning after Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X), reporters encountered two men with boxes outside of the company’s headquarters. One of the two men was Sonwalkar, who introduced himself as a recently laid-off Twitter engineer “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428775/twitter-fake-employee-layoff-rahul-ligma-elon-musk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Rahul Ligma</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite some notoriety gained from the stunt, Somwalkar insists that his startup is a lot more attention-worthy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think many people know me for that anymore,” he told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “I get recognized for Julius a lot more now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Avis will handle general depot operations, including charging and maintaining the vehicles. Users will be able to hail a robotaxi through the Waymo app.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has partnered with other companies before, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/waymo-robotaxis-will-be-on-the-uber-app-in-austin-atlanta-in-early-2025/\">Uber in Austin and Atlanta</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/waymo-outsources-fleet-operations-to-african-fintech-moove-in-phoenix-and-miami/\">Moove in Phoenix</a>. Avis is the first rental car company to help Waymo manage its fleet. And it’s a partnership that will likely extend to other cities in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli said Avis will play a large in role helping the company scale its technology to new markets faster and more cost-effectively. He added that Waymo and Avis Budget Group intend to expand to more cities together over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Close followers of Waymo may not be surprised by the Dallas launch announcement. Earlier this year, Waymo took one of its “road trips” to Dallas, where the company used its sensor-laden vehicles to map the city and conduct initial testing. Since then, Waymo has started testing its autonomous vehicles on public roads with a human safety operator behind the wheel. As it has in every other city it has launched in, Waymo will progress to fully autonomous testing once its tech has been further validated on Dallas streets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bonelli wouldn’t disclose precise launch dates or how many vehicles would be in the initial robotaxi fleet. He did say Waymo will scale the fleet with Avis to hundreds of vehicles over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Avis Budget Group CEO Brian Choi said the partnership marks a “pivotal milestone in its evolution, from a rental car company to a leading provider of fleet management, infrastructure and operations to the broader mobility ecosystem.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Waymo operates commercially in five cities: Austin, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/uber-and-waymos-commercial-robotaxi-service-is-open-for-business-in-atlanta/\">Atlanta</a>, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area, which extends into Silicon Valley.

Harmonic is focused on creating “mathematical superintelligence” or MSI; the startup eventually wants to help users with all fields that rely on math, including physics, statistics, and computer science.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Aristotle] is the first product available to people that does reasoning and formally verifies the output,” said Harmonic CEO and co-founder Tudor Achim in an interview with TechCrunch. “Within the domains that Aristotle supports, which are quantitative reasoning domains, we actually do guarantee that there’s no hallucinations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Harmonic says it also plans to release an API to let enterprises access Aristotle, as well as a web app for consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harmonic says Aristotle achieved gold medal performance on the 2025 International Math Olympiad (IMO) through a formal test (meaning the problems were translated into a machine‑readable format). Google and OpenAI also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/openai-and-google-outdo-the-mathletes-but-not-each-other/\">developed AI models that achieved gold medal performance on this year’s IMO</a>, but through informal tests taken in natural language. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harmonic says it’s not releasing other benchmarks for Aristotle at this time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The beta launch of Aristotle comes just a few weeks since Harmonic raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Kleiner Perkins at an $875 million valuation. Achim claims that Harmonic is “advancing very rapidly along” its path to achieving MSI and that investors believed that was a fair valuation given the scope of his startup’s ambition.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several leading tech companies are focused on training their AI models to solve math problems. AI that can do math is valuable in its own right, but math is also considered a uniquely verifiable domain that demands core reasoning skills. Systems that develop these capabilities may prove useful in other domains as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Achim says that Harmonic achieves its hyper-accurate solutions by having Aristotle produce responses in the open source programming language Lean. Before Aristotle gives an answer to users, he says the model double-checks that the solution is correct through an algorithmic process that doesn’t involve AI. Harmonic’s CEO notes that similar technology is used to verify outputs in high-stakes fields such as medical devices and aviation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even in a narrow domain, achieving hallucination-free performance from an AI model is an incredibly difficult task. Studies have found that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/study-suggests-that-even-the-best-ai-models-hallucinate-a-bunch/\">even leading AI models hallucinate a lot</a>, and the problem doesn’t appear to be getting better. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/\">OpenAI’s latest AI reasoning models hallucinate more than its older ones</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The idea is that the AI can become a helper that can understand what the user is researching, predict what they want to do, and then take action on their behalf.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How well it works in practice remains to be seen, but Microsoft notes that Copilot Mode is still considered an experimental feature. It’s also opt-in by default during these tests and is currently free for any Mac or PC users with <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/supported-regions-and-languages-in-microsoft-copilot-26de43a1-c176-4908-bef7-29c8c37ac7ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">access to Copilot</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are a few main components to Copilot Mode at launch, with more on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once enabled, Edge users will be presented with a new tab page where they can search, chat, and navigate the web with Copilot’s assistance. When visiting a specific web page, they can also turn to Copilot for more help. For example, Microsoft shows how someone might ask the AI companion if a recipe they’re viewing could be made vegan instead, and Copilot suggests substitutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This type of question is something users might ask an AI chatbot today, but this saves the step of having to paste in the content they want to reference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or, someone could just ask the AI to simply present the recipe itself so they can skip reading through the “life story” that now accompanies so many online recipes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031678\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Microsoft</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Microsoft claims that Copilot can handle a variety of tasks on a user’s behalf, like booking appointments, creating shopping lists, and drafting content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This “agentic” use of the web is the next big leap <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/as-the-browser-wars-heat-up-here-are-the-hottest-alternatives-to-chrome-and-safari-in-2025/\">in the AI browser race,</a> but it’s unclear if consumer adoption will naturally follow. The goal, of course, is to make it easier to perform everyday tasks, like reserving a room on Booking.com or a flight via Kayak. However, chatting back-and-forth with an AI to go through the options and your needs isn’t necessarily better or faster than just doing it yourself, depending on your familiarity with the website in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Copilot does allow for voice input, which could be handy for people who aren’t as tech-savvy when it comes to booking things online, or for those who have limited mobility. (Later on, Microsoft says users will be able to give Copilot the additional context it needs, like credentials or history, to manage more advanced actions, like bookings. For now, it’s a bit more manual.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more interesting, perhaps, is Copilot’s ability to be a research companion. With the user’s permission, Copilot can view all open tabs to understand what the person is browsing. This could be useful if they’re doing some type of product comparison or online research, like pricing flights or hotels across multiple sites. Again, these are use cases for AI chatbots, but baking it into the browser could speed up the process of translating the user’s needs to the digital helper.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the future, Copilot will also prompt people to pick up where they left off on a project or something they’re researching, by recommending next steps, Microsoft says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company stresses that Copilot will only be able to access someone’s browsing content when they choose to allow it, and this will be made transparent to the end user with visual cues. However, the idea that you can now toggle on or off a feature that’s able to view and listen to you while you search could leave some people unsettled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is also introducing two new weekly rate limits that reset every seven days; one is an overall usage limit, whereas the other is specific to Anthropic’s most advanced AI model, Claude Opus 4. Anthropic says Max subscribers can purchase additional usage, beyond what the rate limit provides, at standard API rates.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement comes just weeks after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/anthropic-tightens-usage-limits-for-claude-code-without-telling-users/\">Anthropic quietly introduced rate limits for Claude Code</a>. The company said at the time it was aware of the issues but declined to elaborate further. While Anthropic’s AI coding tool has been a hit with developers, the company seems to be having a difficult time serving it broadly. Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://status.anthropic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">status page</a> shows that Claude Code has experienced a partial or major outage at least seven times in the last month — perhaps because some power users seem to be running Claude Code nonstop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Claude Code has experienced unprecedented demand since launch,” said Anthropic spokesperson Amie Rotherham in an email to TechCrunch about the weekly rate limits. Rotherham notes that “most users won’t notice a difference,” and that this limit will affect less than 5% of subscribers, based on their current usage patterns. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic tells TechCrunch that most Pro users can expect 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 through Claude Code within their weekly rate limits. Subscribers to Anthropic’s $100-per-month Max plan can expect 140 to 280 hours of Sonnet 4 and 15 to 35 hours of Opus 4. And subscribers to Anthropic’s $200-per-month Max plan can expect 240 to 480 hours of Sonnet 4 and 24 to 40 hours of Opus 4.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that usage may vary based on codebase size and other factors, however, it’s somewhat unclear how Anthropic is measuring usage here. Anthropic claims <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/anthropic-rolls-out-a-200-per-month-claude-subscription/\">that the $200 Max plan offers 20x more usage than the Pro plan</a> — but based on the updated figures, subscribers now get only about 6x as many Claude Code hours as Pro users.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s possible the 20x figure still applies when measured in tokens or compute, but the company didn’t immediately clarify.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has said before that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anthropic-co-founder-on-cutting-access-to-windsurf-it-would-be-odd-for-us-to-sell-claude-to-openai/\">it’s very constrained when it comes to computational resources</a>, which seems to be the case for most AI model providers today. Most AI companies are racing to bring new AI data centers online to meet the massive demands of serving and training their AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several providers of AI coding tools are revisiting the pricing strategy around their products. In June, the company behind Cursor, Anysphere, changed the way it priced usage for its $20-per-month Pro plan to limit power users from abusing the plan. However, Anysphere later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/\">apologized for poorly communicating those changes</a>, leading to some users paying more than they expected. Another AI coding tool provider, Replit, <a href=\"https://blog.replit.com/effort-based-pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made similar pricing changes in June</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an email to Claude subscribers, Anthropic says it’s committed to “supporting long-running use cases through other options in the future.” However, the company claims these rate limits will help them maintain reliable service broadly in the short term.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update 4:45 p.m. PT: This story was updated to include comments from an Anthropic spokesperson and more details about Anthropic’s weekly rate limits.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And some, including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/chris-krebs-speaks-cuts-trump-cuts-digital-defense-rcna203427\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cybersecurity experts</a> and <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/sen-murphy-trump-administration-has-illegally-gutted-funding-for-cybersecurity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legislators</a>, are not happy about it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of them is <a href=\"https://www.colinahern.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Colin Ahern</a>, the chief cyber officer for the state of New York. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, Ahern said that both he and New York Governor Kathy Hochul are worried that the Trump administration’s cuts to cybersecurity are putting the country at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We work with the federal government day in and day out. We need and want the federal government to be effective,” Ahern told TechCrunch. “I think it’s no secret that we are concerned about some of the things — many of the things, in fact — that we’re seeing with the ‘Big Ugly Bill,’ with the rescissions that just passed,” said Ahern, referring to Trump’s flagship budget that passed in early July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s cybersecurity cuts have been wide-ranging and far-reaching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since taking office, the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/doge-axes-cisa-red-team-staffers-amid-ongoing-federal-cuts/\">fired over a hundred employees</a> at CISA, some of whom the government <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/cisa-scrambles-to-contact-fired-employees-after-court-rules-layoffs-unlawful/\">had to call back after a court ruling</a> reversed the decision. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4019109/trump-seeks-unprecedented-1-23-billion-cut-to-federal-cyber-budget.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cybersecurity spending</a> across federal agencies by more than $1.2 billion, including cutting CISA’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-budget-135m-dhs-2026-house-appropriations/\">budget by</a> $135 million, all the while <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/trump-administration-to-spend-1-billion-on-offensive-hacking-operations/\">earmarking $1 billion over the next four years</a> for offensive cyber operations for overseas hacking operations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, The White House’s <a href=\"http://cybersecuritydive.com/news/trump-nominate-cairncross-cyber-director/739940/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nomination</a> for national cyber director <a href=\"https://therecord.media/sean-cairncross-oncd-nominee-senate-confirmation-hearing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was criticized</a> for his lack of prior experience in the field, and the U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/technology/4-things-to-know-about-school-cybersecurity-and-trump-funding-cuts/2025/04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suspended a cybersecurity support initiative</a> for K-12 schools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everybody wants a federal government that has significant capabilities to deter our adversaries that is resilient against cyberattacks and other attacks from our enemies,” Ahern told TechCrunch. “Like we’ve said publicly, we do think that what’s happening in Washington is putting those things at risk.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the U.S. federal government shoulders much of the responsibility for the country’s cybersecurity, individual states share a significant mandate to secure their own networks, state organizations like public schools, as well as those of critical infrastructure, such as water utilities. But some of the funding for that comes from Washington.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochuls-letter-secretary-homeland-security-release-emergency-management-funding-state\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hochul wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem</a> to ask for funding available under the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), which provides state and local agencies with funds to improve security both in the real world and online. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“HSGP funding is vital to securing and maintaining critical infrastructure assets (transportation hubs, power grids, water systems, communication networks),” wrote Hochul, who urged Noem to make funds available “immediately.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Ahern acknowledges the challenges with the federal government, he said it doesn’t mean the state is “standing still.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re continuing to invest our time, our resources, and our energy in building relationships across state lines, across party lines, [and] relationships with our county and our local governments so that we can continue to provide the safe, resilient and affordable New York that we think has really made New York the cultural, financial, and economic center that it remains,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Ahern, Hochul has been vocal and active in her efforts to improve cybersecurity in New York. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, <a href=\"http://statescoop.com/new-york-cybersecurity-training-awareness-hochul/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the governor signed new legislation</a> that will require anyone working with a computer in a state, city, county, or district government office in the state of New York to take cybersecurity awareness training. The law will also mandate state government offices that are victims of cyberattacks to report the incidents to the state’s homeland security office within 72 hours, and ransomware payments within 24 hours, among other provisions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, Hochul also <a href=\"https://therecord.media/new-york-cyber-regulations-water-grants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced new proposed</a> legislation to start a new grant program for water and wastewater organizations with the goal of helping them fund upgrades that they will have to come up with to comply with upcoming regulations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahern told TechCrunch that the state government is opening a new office in New York City to be staffed with several technologists, including cybersecurity personnel. Ahern said he hopes to recruit some who lost their jobs because of the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“DOGE says you’re fired. New York says you’re hired,” said Ahern, referring to the government’s public <a href=\"https://dol.ny.gov/news/youre-hired-governor-hochul-announces-more-1300-applications-received-new-york-launched\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">slogan</a> for this hiring effort.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Amazon responded with a lengthy blog post in response to the article, which describes the WSJ’s reporting as “<a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prices-increase-wall-street-journal-flawed-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fundamentally flawed</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WSJ analyzed the prices of 2,500 common Amazon items like cough drops, antibacterial wipes, and chicken broth, determining that the prices of these items increased on average by 5% from Trump’s inauguration on January 20 to July 1. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon accused WSJ of “cherry-picking” data and ignoring other factors surrounding the cost of certain products. According to Amazon, some of WSJ’s findings were inaccurate because items like a Dove deodorant and a pack of Yogi Tea bags were on sale in January, when WSJ retrieved its initial pricing data. Amazon says that the price increase on these items occurred due to the promotion ending, not inflation or tariffs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s pricing is often dynamic, leading to fluctuations, which is why a random sampling across products at a point in time makes sense for an analysis like this. That Amazon felt it had to respond to this report suggests the company is sensitive about the topic and could even fear retaliation from the Trump administration.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon costs aside, customers may observe slight upticks in costs on popular items. Per the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/07/15/cpi-inflation-report-june-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ June report</a>, consumer prices rose 0.3% on the month, or 2.7% on the year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The war game was very <em>au courant</em>, running a scenario in which the U.S. and China fought for supremacy over Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liss’ take away from the exercise? “Our core supply chain of the arsenal of democracy — literally, the ships that my grandfather fought in — we don’t have the ship-building capacity. If we did, we don’t have the steel to make it,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that point, Liss said he became “really interested — obsessed, even” with the steel supply chain. “That was really the birth of Nemo Industries.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The basic pitch for <a href=\"https://nemoind.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nemo Industries</a>, Liss’ latest startup, appears as though it were drawn from a Venn diagram of two very American anxieties, steelmaking and AI. The company, until now, has been operating in stealth, but Liss gave TechCrunch a peek behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, the obvious part: Nemo will use AI to optimize the production of pig iron, modernizing an industry that Liss said is woefully outdated. “These plants are run on, at best, Excel spreadsheets. At worst, clipboard technology,” he said. The people who run them have “unbelievable expertise,” he added, but that’s the sort of thing that doesn’t scale well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Liss isn’t pitching Nemo as just another piece of industrial software. Rather, Nemo is planning to build its own furnaces. The decision was driven by Liss’ conviction that companies that use AI from inception will have a “20% to 30% margin advantage” over competitors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In steelmaking, such conviction doesn’t come cheap. Hyundai Motor Group said in March that it would build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana to supply its factories in the U.S. Nemo’s plant may not cost that much since its operations will be focused on pig iron, an intermediate product that steelmakers use to make a range of different alloys.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nemo will fire its furnaces using natural gas, which releases less carbon dioxide than coal, which is commonly used in the iron and steel industry. Liss said the company is considering capturing the furnaces’ carbon pollution; tax incentives introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act remain largely intact, and they make the endeavor profitable for Nemo, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liss’ partner in Nemo is Michael DuBose, an investor who previously worked at Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company. “He’s built billions of dollars in LNG infrastructure,” Liss said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup will need that sort of scale if it’s to succeed. Nemo previously raised $28.2 million, according to PitchBook, and it is currently in talks with existing investors to raise a $100 million Series A with existing investors, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company also has received offers for over $1 billion in incentives from two southern states if the company can build three plants over the course of 15 years, the person said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a tall order for anyone to tackle, but Liss said that sort of ambition is required if the steel industry is going to deliver the sort of returns desired by venture capitalists. And, he added, basic industries like steel have historically delivered big wins for investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you look at the history of our country, many of the greatest companies that created outsize outcomes for their initial investors were in these categories,” Liss said. “Ultimately, what were the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and the Melons and the Fricks investing in? The dollar amounts are so big in these categories.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, the feature also helps Google better compete with other AI features rolled out by retail giant Amazon, which has been using the new technology to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/amazon-taps-generative-ai-to-enhance-product-reviews/\">summarize product ratings and reviews</a>, help customers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/amazon-turns-to-ai-to-help-customers-find-clothes-that-fit-when-shopping-online/\">find clothes that fit</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/amazon-debuts-rufus-an-ai-shopping-assistant-in-its-mobile-app/\">get product recommendations and comparisons</a>, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes arrive as Google, for the first time in many years, is facing a potential competitive threat to Chrome’s dominance in the global browser market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New AI-powered browsers like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Perplexity’s Comet</a>, The Browser Company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/\">Dia</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/operas-new-browser-can-code-websites-and-games-for-you/\">Opera Neon,</a> and perhaps a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks/\">challenger from OpenAI</a> have the search giant thinking about how to infuse AI more directly into its own web browser. For example, Google is developing an AI agent that would be able <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/google-unveils-project-mariner-ai-agents-to-use-the-web-for-you/\">to take control of Chrome for you</a> to take actions on your behalf. Plus, the company recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3009785/gemini-is-now-in-chrome/\">added support for its Gemini AI assistant in Chrome</a> for Gemini subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move is also part of a broader initiative underway at Google to make it more of a modern-day shopping platform for consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Already, the company has tapped AI to help customers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/google-supercharges-shopping-tab-with-ai-and-personalized-recommendation-feed/\">locate the products they’re interested in</a>, get personalized product recommendations, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/googles-new-ai-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-clothes/\">virtually try on clothes</a>, and it has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-adds-ai-powered-shopping-features-for-discovery-and-easy-check-out/\">developing tools</a> for better price tracking, shopping in Google’s AI Mode, and AI-powered agentic checkout. (The latter two were announced at this year’s Google I/O developer conference. Google <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/back-to-school-ai-updates-try-on-price-alerts/\">recently announced</a> that getting outfit and room inspiration in AI Mode would roll out this fall.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

You also want scoops, a bit of a news roundup, and deals, but far and away you’re looking for analysis. I’ve always sprinkled my thoughts and insights throughout the newsletter, but over the next few weeks and months you’ll see me push further into analysis. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On that note, earnings season is upon us and two stood out to me: <strong>GM</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong>. Both companies are facing pressure from tariffs. And while GM also sells gas-powered vehicles, both are trying to sell EVs in a market that has seen growth slow while facing a future without EV incentives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How GM and Tesla plan to navigate this (or at least what they’re signaling) is quite different. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM, which saw tariffs take a $1 billion bite out of its Q2 line, still sees EVs as its “north star.” And while GM certainly trails Tesla in EV sales today, it has a bigger mix of EV models to attract customers — more than a dozen in all. And Chevrolet is now the No. 2 EV brand in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while GM did tout $4 billion of deferred revenue from its advanced driver-assistance system Super Cruise, along with OnStar and other software services that will be recognized over time, the big theme of the call was “flexibility.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Chair and CEO Mary Barra</strong> and <strong>CFO Paul Jacobson</strong> said the word “flexibility” nine times during the Q2 earnings call. What they mean by flexibility is setting up factories where they can easily assemble EVs and ICE vehicles — and change up the mix based on demand. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Tesla is betting heavily on the “future,” and for CEO Elon Musk that means autonomy and AI, or as he sometimes calls it, “real-world AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vast majority (about 74%) of Tesla’s revenue still comes from selling cars, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/tesla-profits-pulled-down-by-falling-ev-sales-and-regulatory-credits/\">although Q2 results</a> show a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue. But if you listened to the Q2 call, it’s clear that Elon Musk isn’t interested in Tesla being a car company. (He even admitted that the highly anticipated breakthrough cheaper model Tesla is working on is really just a stripped down version of the Model Y.)  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk wants to make and sell Optimus robots and deploy autonomous vehicles. The problem is that today these products — or future products — are not generating profits, let alone revenue. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, Tesla does bring in revenue from its advanced driver-assistance system known as supervised Full Self-Driving. (This is not an autonomous vehicle and requires human driver engagement.) And yes, the company is charging for robotaxi rides in South Austin, but it is not at scale, nor is it profitable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk acknowledged there would be some rough quarters ahead, but he still believes that ultimately this will be where the bulk of Tesla profits come from. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think that this transition is going to take far longer than Musk has publicly shared. (Just today, The Information reported the company is far behind on its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/tesla-is-reportedly-behind-on-its-pledge-to-build-5000-optimus-bots-this-year/\">Optimus robot production goal</a>.) And it seems the company is feeling the pressure to act. For instance, Tesla is reportedly bringing a limited version of its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/tesla-is-reportedly-bringing-a-limited-version-of-its-robotaxi-service-to-san-francisco/\">robotaxi service to San Francisco</a> this weekend even though it technically doesn’t have the required permits. (What do you think Tesla’s workaround will be?)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Tesla is under regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales and even threaten his future plans around FSD. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

The AI5, a generation that is primarily built for FSD, will initially be made in TSMC’s Taiwan factory and then at its Arizona facility. Samsung already makes the AI4 chip, according to Musk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is a boost for Samsung, which struggled to get its chip-making project off the ground after failing to attract and retain major clients. Musk said in another post that Tesla may end up spending more than $16.5 billion on Samsung chips. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Actual output is likely to be several times higher,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a later post, Musk said Samsung agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress. And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house,” Musk wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla switched over from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/teslas-computer-is-now-in-all-new-cars-and-a-next-gen-chip-is-already-halfway-done/\">Nvidia’s Drive platform</a> to its own custom chip in 2019. That chip, known as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/tesla-vaunts-creation-of-the-best-chip-in-the-world-for-self-driving/\">FSD Computer</a> (FSDC) or Hardware 3, launched that year in all of its EVs. The FSDC, made by Samsung, consists of two duplicate systems right next to each other on one board — a design choice meant to create redundancy required for any automated driving system. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the company’s attention to its custom chips has expanded along with its ambitions. The AI chips are the centerpiece of Tesla’s push to move from an automaker to an AI and robotics company. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For inference tasks, the H20 outperforms even the H100, an AI chip this administration has restricted access to due to its advanced capabilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter also claimed that selling the H20 chips in China will worsen the existing AI chip bottleneck in the U.S.; that these chips could be used to support China’s military; and that this decision will weaken overall chip export controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one,” the letter said. “We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge. This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter’s signatories include Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser during Trump’s first term; Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush; and David Feith, a former member of the National Security Council, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This letter comes two weeks after the DOC gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its AI chips in China again in relation to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/nvidias-resumption-of-h20-chip-sales-related-to-rare-earth-element-trade-talks/\">ongoing trade discussions with China regarding rare earth elements</a>. At the time, Lutnick tried to downplay the decision and said Nvidia’s H20 was the company’s “fourth best” AI chip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, the Trump administration unveiled its AI Action Plan, which highlighted the need for U.S. AI chip export restrictions but was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-action-plan-aims-to-block-chip-exports-to-china-but-lacks-key-details/\">light on the details</a> of what those export controls would look like.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After the audit, <a href=\"http://itch.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Itch.io</a> said NSFW game creators will be required to confirm that their content is allowed under the policies of their payment processors linked to their account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On social media, users criticizing <a href=\"http://itch.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Itch.io</a>’s decision noted that its <a href=\"https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">current terms</a> declare that adult content violations are “permanent with no chance of appeal” and that any funds in an offending account “will not be eligible for payout” — or as one developer <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/gwenckatz.bsky.social/post/3luv4rdhsss2k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">put it</a>, “If you violate the rules, we take all your money. Not just the money from that work, ALL your money from EVERYTHING you’ve ever made.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is far from the first time that payment companies appear to have pressured online platforms over adult content — for example, last year Gumroad pointed to restrictions from payment processors when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/15/gumroad-no-longer-allows-most-nsfw-art-leaving-its-adult-creators-panicked/\">implemented stricter rules</a> around NSFW art, and OnlyFans also blamed “banking partners and payment providers” when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/\">banned explicit content</a> (a decision that it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/style/onlyfans-ban-reversed.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">subsequently reversed</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Change.org petition</a> with more than 137,000 verified signatures criticizes Mastercard and Visa for their role in these types of decisions. Among other things, the petition demands that the payment companies “stop censoring legal fictional content that complies with the law and platform standards” and “reject influence from activist groups that promote moral panic or misrepresent fiction as harm.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
