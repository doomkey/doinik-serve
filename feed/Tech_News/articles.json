With Sharma’s most recent role as the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, these moves suggest that Microsoft might be doubling down on bringing AI into video games.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company had already been experimenting with ways to combine AI and gaming, for example <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/xbox-debuts-a-new-ai-powered-gaming-companion/\">developing an AI gaming companion</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/06/microsoft-releases-ai-generated-quake-ii-demo-but-admits-limitations/\">releasing a buggy, AI-generated level from “Quake II.” </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, in an internal memo <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo\">published by The Verge</a>, Sharma wrote that Microsoft “will invent new business models and new ways to play” and said that “monetization and AI” will both “evolve and influence this future.” At the same time, she said that the company “will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us,” Sharma added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s just one of three “commitments” Sharma made in her memo. The others involve building “great games beloved by players” and prioritizing Xbox.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The generative AI boom minted a startup a minute. But as the dust starts to settle, two once-hot business models are looking more like cautionary tales: LLM wrappers and AI aggregators. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Darren Mowry, who leads Google’s global startup organization across Cloud, DeepMind, and Alphabet, says startups with these hooks have their “check engine light” on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LLM wrappers are essentially startups that wrap existing large language models, like Claude, GPT, or Gemini, with a product or UX layer to solve a specific problem. An example would be a startup that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://community.openai.com/t/openai-why-are-you-killing-my-startup-for-the-second-time/1355491\">uses AI to helps students study</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re really just counting on the back end model to do all the work and you’re almost white-labeling that model, the industry doesn’t have a lot of patience for that anymore,” Mowry said on this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/google-clouds-vp-for-startups-on-reading-your-check-engine-light-before-its-too-late/\">week’s episode of Equity</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wrapping “very thin intellectual property wrapped around Gemini or GPT-5” signals you’re not differentiating yourself, Mowry says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve got to have deep, wide moats that are either horizontally differentiated or something really specific to a vertical market” for a startup to “progress and grow,” he said. Examples of the deep moat LLM wrapper type include Cursor, a GPT-powered coding assistant, or Harvey AI, a legal AI assistant.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, startups can no longer expect to slap a UI on top of a GPT and get traction on their product, like they could, perhaps, in mid-2024 when OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/openai-launches-a-store-for-custom-ai-powered-chatbots/\">launched its ChatGPT store</a>. The challenge now is to build sustainable product value. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI aggregators are a subset of wrappers — they’re startups that aggregate multiple LLMs into one interface or API layer to route queries across models and give users access to multiple models. These companies typically provide an orchestration layer that includes monitoring, governance, or eval tooling. Think: AI search startup Perplexity or developer platform OpenRouter, which provides access to multiple AI models via a single API. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many of these platforms have gained ground, Mowry’s words are clear to incoming startups: “Stay out of the aggregator business.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Generally speaking, aggregators aren’t seeing much growth or progression these days because, he says, users want “some intellectual property built in” to ensure they’re routed to the right model at the right time based on their needs — not because of behind-the-scenes compute or access constraints.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mowry has been in the cloud game for decades, cutting his teeth at AWS and Microsoft before setting up shop at Google Cloud, and he’s seen how this plays out. He said the situation today mirrors the early days of cloud computing in the late 2000s/early 2010s as Amazon’s cloud business started taking off. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that time, a crop of startups sprang up to resell AWS infrastructure, marketing themselves as easier entry points that provided tooling, billing consolidation, and support. But when Amazon built its own enterprise tools and customers learned to manage cloud services directly, most of those startups were squeezed out. The only survivors were the ones who added real services, like security, migration, or DevOps consulting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI aggregators today face similar margin pressure as model providers expand into enterprise features themselves, potentially sidelining middlemen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For his part, Mowry is bullish on vibe coding and developer platforms, which had a record-breaking year in 2025 with startups like Replit, Lovable, and Cursor (all Google Cloud customers, per Mowry) attracting major investment and customer traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mowry also expects strong growth in direct-to-consumer tech, in companies that put some of these powerful AI tools into the hands of customers. He pointed to the opportunity for film and TV students to use Google’s AI video generator Veo to bring stories to life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond AI, Mowry also thinks biotech and climate tech are having a moment — both in terms of venture investment going into the two industries and the “incredible amounts of data” startups can access to create real value “in ways we would never have been able to before.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

An OpenAI spokesperson said Van Rootselaar’s activity did not meet the criteria for reporting to law enforcement; the company reached out to Canadian authorities after the incident.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. “We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT transcripts weren’t the only concerning part of Van Rootselaar’s digital footprint. She apparently created a game on Roblox, the world simulation platform frequented by children, which simulated a mass shooting at a mall. She also posted about guns on Reddit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Van Rootselaar’s instability was also known to local police, who had been called to her family’s home after she started a fire while under the influence of unspecified drugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LLM chatbots built by OpenAI and its competitors have been accused of triggering mental breakdowns in users who lose grip on reality while conversing with digital models. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/\">Multiple</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-lawsuit-colordo-man-suicide-openai-sam-altman/\">lawsuits</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/openai-chatgpt-suicide-lawsuit-invs-vis\">have</a> been filed that cite chat transcripts that encourage people to commit suicide or offer assistance in doing so.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you are in a crisis or having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This post has been updated with comment from OpenAI.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Where do I know you from?” someone asks, as though Rogowsky could be a friend of a friend they had met at a party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know your face,” another person says, staring thoughtfully at the 41-year-old.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A cosplayer dressed as a Ghostbuster finally figures it out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Did you used to do that game show online?” he asks. “Like, every night?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogowsky was just poking fun at himself, embracing the persona of a washed-up internet sensation. “I know my place,” he tells TechCrunch. “I’m not walking around like everybody’s supposed to know who I am.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But seven years ago, everyone did. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogowsky was once the face of HQ Trivia, an app that exploded into popular culture, then faded out of the public consciousness almost as fast. Between 2017 and 2019, Rogowsky hosted the live mobile game show twice a day. At its peak, it drew more than 2.4 million daily viewers each night. It garnered 20 million lifetime downloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the comedian is back with an app of his own called Savvy, which shares a lot of the DNA of HQ. Savvy’s first game, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/savvy-words-puzzles-live/id6748058412\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TextSavvy,</a> is a daily live game show where players can earn cash — only this time, viewers are competing against Rogowsky in a word puzzle game that’s something like a hybrid of The New York Times’ Wordle and Connections, rather than trivia. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe this is my calling in a weird way,” Rogowsky says. “I get up there in front of that camera, there’s thousands of people watching at home — millions, back in the HQ days — and it just flows.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title='Introducing... \"TextSavvy\" with Scott Rogowsky' src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/06JIcqpfqJU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-i-have-more-to-do-here\">‘I have more to do here’</h1>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HQ Trivia was founded by the creators of Vine — the short-video platform that predated TikTok — and became a genuine cultural sensation. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZg75Q-FFqc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">National news</a> channels <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oOwRfxJpdY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ran stories</a> about office workers dropping everything in the middle of the day to play HQ at 3 p.m. It was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGi3DBh0rA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">groundbreaking</a> — appointment entertainment in a new format for the streaming era — until the company imploded in a barrage of unfortunate circumstances. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One founder, Colin Kroll, died of a drug overdose; the other founder, Rus Yusupov, was a divisive leader who clashed with his staff. He once <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ceo-of-hq-the-hottest-app-going-if-you-run-this-profile-well-fire-our-host/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">threatened a journalist</a> that he would fire Rogowsky if she published an interview with Rogowsky where he mentioned liking Sweetgreen salads (Yusupov apparently didn’t want to give the fast-food chain free publicity). Most of all, HQ Trivia fell victim to the same trap that dooms so many startups. The company had raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/06/hq-trivia-questions/\">$15 million funding round</a> at a $100 million valuation, but it was — quite literally — giving away money, and it never developed a meaningful plan to monetize or build a sustainable business model. The company ultimately filed for bankruptcy in February 2020, with its demise later becoming fodder for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch%3A_The_Rise_%26_Fall_of_HQ_Trivia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dramatic documentaries</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2020/05/20/pop-culture/hq-trivia-rise-fall-viral-sensation-episode-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">true-crime-adjacent podcasts</a> dissecting how such a promising app failed so spectacularly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was, understandably, a real blow for Rogowsky. But more bad luck followed. A baseball superfan, Rogowsky had left HQ Trivia in 2019 for a job hosting <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-dazn-agree-to-3-year-digital-rights-deal-c300774598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a daily MLB Network show</a>. He felt like he finally made it — he still lights up recalling running into Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez in the bathroom. But his show was canceled when the pandemic shut down baseball. He tried a handful of times over the years to recreate a company like HQ, but it was a journey of false starts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Crazy s–t happened that I had no control over, and I felt like I was being tossed and turned on this raft in the ocean, just getting battered by things I can’t control, and that was sort of my attitude about life in general,” he says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He considered himself retired from show business and opened a vintage store in California. But he missed comedy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I went through this very meaningful personal transformation in the last couple of years,” he said. That process culminated in a seven-day mountain retreat called “the Hoffman Process,” a program that he describes as a digital detox combining lessons in psychology and neuroscience that helped him “take control of [his] life again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It gave me a lot of clarity to say, you know what, I have more to do here,” Rogowsky says. “I got out of that retreat and I was like, ‘I have something to say. People find me funny and entertaining. I find myself funny and entertaining.’”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People tuned into HQ Trivia for the prospect of winning a cash prize, but the odds of winning were slim. Millions of viewers came back each night because of Rogowsky’s quick wit and charm, which earned him a cult following of fans who still call him “Quiz Daddy.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“From the psychological, emotional side, I couldn’t really process what was going on,” Rogowsky says, reflecting on his viral fame. “And in the seven humbling years since, I have a vastly new perspective… I have my fanbase, I have my core followers right here. They’re on board with me, and it’s a matter of getting the word out.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?w=673\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094940\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png 1772w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=148,150 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=297,300 297w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=768,776 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=673,680 673w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=1188,1200 1188w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=1267,1280 1267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=426,430 426w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=713,720 713w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=891,900 891w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=792,800 792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=1521,1536 1521w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=661,668 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=371,375 371w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=611,617 611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=526,531 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Savvy</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-we-re-not-going-anywhere-this-time\">‘We’re not going anywhere this time’</h1>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogowsky received a lot of messages over the years from people who wanted to help him build the next HQ. But last year, a direct message on X from European game designer Johan de Jager grabbed his attention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The idea was the host plays against the audience, so it’s like a two-way interaction,” Rogowsky says. “Imagine HQ if I wasn’t just asking the questions but also answering [them]… That adds another layer to it that no one had thought of before.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in the age of AI, where players can easily look up answers, Rogowsky was skeptical that a trivia game could work fairly, so Savvy embraced word puzzles instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most that Savvy has paid out in a single game is around $400 — small compared to HQ’s occasional six-figure prize pools. That’s because Rogowsky and his co-founders are funding the company themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Look, I know this isn’t the thousands of dollars that you saw on HQ, the hundreds of thousands that we eventually got to,” Rogowsky said on one recent <a href=\"https://youtu.be/J2Q0yzT76EQ?si=oyXHZRnwD9pgOnoz&amp;t=1279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TextSavvy broadcast</a>. “But the difference is HQ was funded by venture capital. They had $8 million in the bank to start. They got another $15 million from other venture capitalists. We don’t got that… This is a low-budge operashe because I’m paying for it!”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogowsky says he has spoken with investors about Savvy and even gotten some enticing offers. But venture backing often comes with pressure on founders to maximize returns as fast as they can, a model that can set a business up to fail, as HQ demonstrated. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People want to 10x and 100x [their investment]… I’d be very happy to get to a point of profitability, to where we can just keep growing the company, keep hiring more people, keep making more games,” Rogowsky says. “I’m not looking for some type of eight-figure, nine-figure exit. This is what I want to do. I’m going to do this as long as I continue to wake up every morning and say, ‘Goddamn, I’m excited to get up there in front of that camera and have fun.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TextSavvy is currently running a “Season 0,” a soft launch that allows the team to work through technical kinks before formally launching on March 1. So far, without much promotion, TextSavvy has peaked at about 4,000 viewers in one night. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not much compared to the HQ days. Then again, when TechCrunch first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/hq-trivia/\">wrote about HQ</a>, the app only had about 3,300 concurrent viewers. Who’s to say Savvy can’t do it again?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not going anywhere this time,” Rogowsky said. “There’s no one to fire me. There’s no drama, there’s no tension. There’s not going to be a documentary about Savvy the way there was about HQ.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

End-to-end encryption for RCS conversations will one day help ensure messages between iPhone users and Android users are just as secure as iMessage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Apple is only testing this between iPhones in beta. These conversations will be labeled as encrypted and cannot be read while sent between devices. The company notes that the feature will be released publicly in a later software update for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS, and the beta is not available for all devices and carriers.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-stolen-device-detection-is-on-by-default\">Stolen Device Detection is on by default</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Security improvements are another highlight of iOS 26.4. Stolen Device Protection is now enabled by default, adding an extra layer of biometric authentication for sensitive actions such as accessing saved passwords or making certain account changes. By requiring Face ID or Touch ID authentication in more scenarios, Apple reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a device is stolen and the passcode is compromised.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=486\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095090\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=857,1200 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=914,1280 914w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=307,430 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=514,720 514w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=643,900 643w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=572,800 572w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=477,668 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=268,375 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=441,617 441w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=379,531 379w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=36,50 36w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-carplay-adds-in-car-video-playback\">CarPlay adds in-car video playback</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Drivers using Apple CarPlay will also notice changes.

They stayed in touch even after Antony moved to Miro and Gootnick to Hopin and later Thrive Global.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No matter where they worked, Antony and Gootnick kept running into the same manual challenges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way financial statements come together, it’s just patched together in a lot of spreadsheets, moved into a bunch of Word documents, emailed back and forth between people,” Antony told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, in 2023, the pair decided to launch <a href=\"https://www.inscopehq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">InScope</a>, an AI-powered financial reporting platform that helps companies and accounting firms automate many aspects of the financial statement preparation process. The startup just raised $14.5 million in Series A funding led by Norwest, with participation from Storm Ventures and existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While InScope isn’t fully automating the generation of income statements and balance sheets yet, it automates a vast amount of the manual busy work, from verifying math to formatting. Simply ensuring that dollar signs and commas are uniform and correctly placed can save accountants up to 20% of their time, according to Antony, InScope’s CEO.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last 12 months, InScope has grown its customer base by 5x, attracting significant accounting firms such as CohnReznick, currently ranked in the <a href=\"https://insidepublicaccounting.com/ipa-top-500-firms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">top 15 nationally</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, it may be a while before accountants — a profession Antony describes as risk-averse — feel comfortable letting AI fully automate financial statement preparation. Nonetheless, that remains InScope’s ultimate goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Norwest partner Sean Jacobsohn told TechCrunch that he invested in InScope after he heard from multiple clients that the startup’s product saves them a lot of time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jacobsohn is convinced that InScope stands out because few founders possess the specific expertise required to reinvent financial reporting technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a very complex space, and you need to be able to have been in the shoes of the buyer before,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Antony agrees that accountants are not typically the type to launch startups. Fortunately, she and Gootnick developed their entrepreneurial instincts through years of operating within the fast-paced cultures of other high-growth startups.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

OpenAI has traditionally focused on consumer users, for instance, while its rival Anthropic tends to target enterprises. Elon Musk’s xAI, we discovered recently, has been placing particular emphasis on video-game walkthroughs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, Business Insider’s Grace Kay published <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a detailed and far-reaching report about xAI</a>, the AI startup recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired by SpaceX</a>, with particular emphasis on how Musk is making life difficult for employees. But this particular anecdote stood out:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game “Baldur’s Gate,” according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, you can imagine the frustration of any respected and experienced engineer who shows up to work thinking he’ll be tackling fundamental problems of knowledge and machine intelligence, only to be sidetracked into helping a 54-year-old man beat his video game. But the anecdote raises an even more pressing question: Did Musk end up getting the gaming skills he wanted?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To answer that question, our resident RPG enthusiast Ram Iyer put together a set of five general questions about Baldur’s Gate, which we ran against xAI and the three major models in a kind of quasi-benchmark that I’ve decided to call “BaldurBench.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the interest of journalistic transparency, I’ve made all the chat transcripts public, so you can see them here: <a href=\"https://grok.com/c/ab4b736e-fee2-441e-857f-23707c1ff45a?rid=d42e7633-df9f-41d6-bd77-6d29ca2feba6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Grok</a>, <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/699886c6-e330-8013-9490-1263ab24d24b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/23f5f1e3-0f00-40bf-a651-8a3c180b68c6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude</a>, and <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/share/862fa83ab1da\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gemini</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, the good news: Grok actually gives pretty good information. Its responses were a bit dense with gamer jargon — “save-scumming” instead of saving and “DPS” instead of damage — but the answers were both useful and well-informed, provided you knew what it was talking about. Grok also really loves tables and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorycraft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">theorycraft</a>, which is about what you would expect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are lots of Baldur’s Gate guides out there and the models were generally drawing from the same ones, so the biggest differences were stylistic. ChatGPT prefers bulleted lists and sentence fragments, while Gemini loves to bold important words.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest surprise was Claude, which was particularly concerned about giving me information that would spoil my experience of the game. When I asked about good party compositions, it closed the guidance by saying, “Don’t stress too much and just play what sounds fun to you.” Thanks, Claude!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to bear in mind, this is a subject area we know (thanks to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Business Insider’s reporting</a>) that xAI has specifically focused on reaching parity. So we shouldn’t read too much into the fact that, after the reported sprint, Grok’s advice turned out about the same as the other models. Still, it’s nice to know xAI can make it work if it tries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p> \n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Under this scheme, the workers’ earnings were funneled back to Pyongyang, which the regime used to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/five-people-plead-guilty-to-helping-north-koreans-infiltrate-us-companies-as-remote-it-workers/\">latest in a string of recent convictions</a> of individuals involved in facilitating ongoing North Korean <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/\">so-called “IT worker” schemes</a>. Security researchers have described North Korean workers as a “triple threat” to U.S. and Western businesses, as they violate U.S. sanctions, all the while enabling North Koreans to steal sensitive company data, and then later extort those victim companies into not publicly releasing corporate secrets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors said Didenko ran a website called Upworksell, which allowed people working overseas, including North Koreans, to buy or rent stolen identities for gaining employment with U.S. firms. Didenko handled more than 870 stolen identities, per the Justice Department.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FBI seized Upworksell in 2024 and diverted its traffic to its own servers.

The company also made it easy for users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/22/how-to-cross-post-from-instagram-and-facebook-to-threads/\">cross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads</a>, which also helped boost adoption. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These moves have paid off. Data from market intelligence provider Similarweb last month indicated that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/\">Threads is now seeing more daily usage</a> than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices.

It’s unclear exactly how many workers are being laid off, but it is likely in the hundreds. Lucid Motors reported having 6,800 full-time employees globally <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000162828025007725/lcid-20241231.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">at the end of 2024</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Saying goodbye to colleagues is never easy,” interim CEO Marc Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today’s actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period.” The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cuts come as the company is in the middle of ramping up production and deliveries of its Gravity SUV. While Lucid Motors struggled with Gravity production and quality issues during the first few months, the company has been able to pick up the pace, and ultimately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/lucid-motors-doubled-ev-output-in-2025-after-early-gravity-suv-struggles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">doubled its 2024 output</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also preparing to launch a more affordable mid-size EV later this year that is expected to cost around $50,000. It’s collaborating with Uber and autonomous vehicle company Nuro on launching a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area this year, too. The company is scheduled to release its financial results for 2025 next week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Importantly, today’s actions do not affect our strategy,” Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid Motors has now gone almost a full year without a permanent CEO. Peter Rawlinson, who was the company’s chief executive and chief technical officer, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/25/lucid-motors-ceo-peter-rawlinson-steps-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">abruptly resigned</a> on February 25, 2025. Since then, Lucid Motors has seen a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/lucid-motors-chief-engineer-leaves-after-10-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">significant amount of turnover in its executive ranks</a>, including the loss of its chief engineer, who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/lucid-motors-former-chief-engineer-sues-for-wrongful-termination-and-discrimination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sued the company</a> in December for wrongful termination and discrimination.

Birds chirp, contributing to the tropical din, as he approaches a shrine at the base of a starfruit tree. He bends to inspect a framed black-and-white photograph of a woman, her hair in a 1950s side part. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Suddenly, a gust of wind shakes the tree’s branches, knocking over the contents of the shrine. The man steps back, trips on a root, and hits his head. When he awakens, he’s in a dark, misty forest, a woman wearing a clay mask standing over him, brandishing a sword. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Who are you who dares to sleep under the sacred tree?” she asks in Ilocano, a Philippine language widely spoken in Hawaii’s Filipino community, while holding the sword at his throat. He replies that he’s lost and turns to flee. She chases, alternating between running and floating through the air. He falls again. She advances, sword held high. He throws a rock at her, shattering the clay mask and revealing half her face. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mom?” he asks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the opening of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl-QFbdEj8M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Murmuray</a>,” a short film by independent filmmaker Brad Tangonan. Everything about this film felt like his previous work, from the tactile nature shots to the dreamlike desaturated highlights. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The only difference? He made it using AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tangonan was one of 10 filmmakers to participate in Google Flow Sessions, a five-week cohort that gave creatives access to Google’s suite of AI tools to produce short films, including Gemini, image generator Nano Banana Pro, and film generator Veo.   </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each film differed in scope. Hal Watmough’s “You’ve Been Here Before” blended hyperreal, lifelike visuals with cartoonish stylization to playfully explore the importance of a morning routine, while Tabitha Swanson’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOhiht7-rmE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“The Antidote to Fear is Curiosity”</a> is a more esoteric, philosophical conversation about our relationship with AI and ourselves. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of these short films, which were screened at Soho House New York late last year, felt like AI slop. Each independent filmmaker I spoke to said that, in the case of these films, AI had enabled them to tell a story they otherwise wouldn’t have had the budget or time to tell. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mumuray - Short Film (Trailer)\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tl-QFbdEj8M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I see all of these tools, whether it be a camera you can pick up or generative AI, as ways for an artist to express what they have in their mind,” Tangonan told me after the screenings. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This AI-is-just-another-tool-for-creators argument is certainly the message Google is trying to underscore. Google isn’t wrong; AI will increasingly be part of a creator’s toolkit as video generation products improve. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, companies like Google, Runway, OpenAI, Kling, Luma AI, and Higgsfield progressed far beyond the uncanny, prompt-based novelties of the year prior. The AI video industry, with billions in venture capital dollars in tow, is now moving from prototype to post-production.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This era of AI abundance that has provided tools to “democratize access” to the film industry also threatens to erase jobs and creativity, smothering them under an avalanche of low-effort slop. The existential stakes have pitted creatives against one another. Those who engage with AI risk being labeled as complicit; those who don’t risk becoming obsolete. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question isn’t whether the tools belong in the toolkit — they’re coming, whether we like it or not. Instead it is: What kind of filmmaking survives when the industry pushes for speed and scale over quality? And what happens when individual artists use the same tools to make something that actually matters?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-but-is-it-slop\"><strong>But is it slop?</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094472\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mimesis_KeenanMacWilliam.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam used AI to animate scans of plants and fish in her short film “Mimesis”</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Keenan MacWilliam</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The arguments against AI in filmmaking are plentiful — and from some of the highest-profile names in the industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guillermo-del-toro-finally-makes-his-own-frankenstein/id214089682?i=1000733180492\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said last October</a> that he would rather die than use generative AI to make a film. James Cameron said in a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0uKh4VT6s8&amp;t=1586s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CBS interview</a> the idea of generating actors and emotions with prompts is “horrifying,” and that generative AI is only capable of spitting out a blended average of everything that’s ever been done by humans before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Werner Herzog said the films he’s seen created by AI “have no soul.” He added: “The common denominator, and nothing beyond this common denominator, can be found in these fabrications.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cameron and Herzog’s thesis is that AI is taking the wheel of creation out of the hands of humans and couldn’t possibly be used to create a representation of their own lived experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s very easy to be angry with AI as a concept in the machine, but it’s harder to be angry with someone that’s made something personal,” Watmough told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tangonan, who describes “Murmuray” as a “family story,” agrees with that sentiment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is a facilitator,” Tangonan said. “I’m still making all the creative decisions. When people see ‘AI slop’ online, it’s a lot of lowest common denominator stuff. And, yeah, if you hand over the keys to AI, that’s what you’re going to get. But if you have a voice and a creative perspective and a style, then you’re going to get something different.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using AI in filmmaking doesn’t mean just prompting a film into existence. Tangonan, for example, wrote the script for “Murmuray” without AI and gathered visual references for a shot list. He then fed that content into Nano Banana Pro to generate images that matched his style and served as the foundation for video generation.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam also took pains to ensure her short film “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQR8Py0kmPA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mimesis</a>,” a fictional guided meditation, was a “true extension of [her] visual language, rather than a ‘blender’ of other artists’ work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MacWilliam wrote the script and recorded her own voice for the mock meditation, which was equal parts relaxing and funny. Onscreen, over a black, watery backdrop, psychedelic images of flowers and plants blended into each other, turned into smoke, morphed into seahorses, and swam away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The images all came from MacWilliam’s own collection of scanned flora and fauna — she travels with her scanner everywhere she goes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I spent a lot of time learning how to make apps that were built with my own dataset, and then used those as reference points,” MacWilliam told TechCrunch, adding that she worked with her long-time composer and sound designer on the film. “I made a choice to avoid using AI for anything that I could have shot with a camera or ask my collaborators to animate. My goal was to unlock new forms of expression for my established themes and style, not to replace the roles of the people who I like to work with.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was a common thread among the filmmakers I spoke to at the Google Flow event — the desire to use AI only in cases when it was not possible to rely on other humans, or when the strange nature of AI generations serve the story. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, Sander van Bellegem’s “<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sander-van-bellegem_last-friday-i-had-the-chance-to-premiere-activity-7408924221202006018-diM8/?utm_medium=ios_app&amp;rcm=ACoAABLnShEBS_n2qGWsidtdfkmYqt-f8sZLBvo&amp;utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_campaign=copy_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Melongray</a>” explored the acceleration of life through trippy visualizations. In one shot, a salamander transforms into a balloon. It wasn’t part of his original storyline, but he was inspired by the way AI allowed him to push the limits of both his imagination and physics. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-to-be-efficient-or-not-to-be\"><strong>To be [efficient] or not to be</strong>?</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"OCEAN VIEW\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/636k7kUf9zc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s film studio <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/hollywood-jobs-are-disappearing/556a88af-b759-491f-8589-d6aa2d3a432e?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">budgets are being squeezed</a> by rising filming costs, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/poll-movies-streaming-theaters-tickets-a1b6b6d48f47389f422ab7299c4e3e74\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pivot to streaming</a>, and risk-averse corporate consolidation. That means big spends are saved for predictable revenue generators (see: the millionth Marvel movie) and original <a href=\"https://www.greenlightanalytics.com/box-office-behavior-netflix-mid-budget-viewership/?utm_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mid-budget movies</a> have all but been abandoned. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adding AI to the mix risks exacerbating the scarcity mindset of studios to the point where they might try to replace anything that can be — actors, sets, lighting — art and quality be damned. However, the efficiencies AI brings could also lower barriers and make it easier for film studios to produce original work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even Cameron noted in his CBS interview that generative AI could make VFX cheaper, which could lead to more imaginative sci-fi and fantasy films — expensive endeavors that are reserved for existing IP like “Avatar.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shot in “Murmuray” where the woman is flying through the forest would have taken expensive VFX or very complex rigging on set, both out of budget for a short film, according to Tangonan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even filmmakers who see the benefits in efficiency understand the risks to artistic expression. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think efficiency in general is not the best friend of creativity,” MacWilliam said.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-empowered-and-isolated\"><strong>Empowered and isolated</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094473\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Youve-Been-Here-Before-by-Hal-Watmough.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Hal Watmough’s short film “You’ve Been Here Before” playfully explores the importance of morning routine</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Hal Watmough</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For independent filmmakers, having so many powerful tools at their disposal is a blessing and a curse. It “democratizes access,” sure, but it also means working alone. The more you <em>can</em> do yourself, the less reason there is to collaborate. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know I’m a one-man band, and I just made all this by myself…but that should never be the way that anyone tells a story or makes a film,” Watmough told TechCrunch, noting that an actor friend of his contributed the voice for his short. “It should be a collaborative process because the more people that are involved, the more accessible it is by everyone and the more it reaches and connects with people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Directors make creative decisions, but not all of them. The filmmakers I spoke to found themselves suddenly playing set designer, lighting director, costumer — roles requiring expertise they didn’t have. It was frustrating and draining, pulling them away from the work they actually cared about. And upsetting to think about how an entire ecosystem could be upended so swiftly. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The filmmakers I spoke to also said they’d rather not replace actors with AI, though some said AI-generated actors are an inevitability for smaller studios. The tools exist, and are increasingly getting better, to generate actors, their emotions, their movements. AI video startups like Luma AI, which last November raised <a href=\"https://lumalabs.ai/press/luma-ai-raises-900-million-series-c-led-by-humain-and-partners-on-2-gigawatt-ai-supercluster-in-saudi-arabia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a $900 million Series C</a>, are even building technology that allows you to shoot an actor’s performance once, and then use AI to change the character, costume, and set. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In an ideal world, I would work with real actors and some cinematographer and department heads and the full crew to make something amazing and use AI and complement that to be able to do things that we can’t do on set, whether for budgetary or time reasons,” Tangonan. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-if-artists-don-t-define-ai-studios-will\"><strong>If artists don’t define AI, studios will</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"MIMESIS: A Salmon Skin Meditation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQR8Py0kmPA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think making any creative work that uses new technology always requires a certain kind of gut check and a willingness to have conversations around the work,” MacWilliam said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are tools,” she added. “How are you going to use the tool? Are you going to be ethical about it? Are you going to ask questions? Are you going to be transparent and share knowledge?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But many don’t see AI tools as neutral. Labor replacement aside, there are still copyright concerns. AI video generation startup <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/runway-ai-image-generator-training-data-youtube/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Runway</a> has reportedly scraped thousands of hours of YouTube videos and copyrighted studio content, while others — including Google, OpenAI, and Luma AI — have faced questions about whether they are doing the same, or training on copyrighted films and stock footage without permission. (Though some tools, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/moonvalleys-ethical-ai-video-model-for-filmmakers-is-now-publicly-available/\">Moonvalley’s Marey</a>, are trained only on openly licensed data.) Then there are the environmental horrors — <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/youll-be-as-annoyed-as-me-when-you-learn-how-much-energy-a-few-seconds-of-ai-video-costs?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some estimates suggest </a>generating seconds of AI video can consume as much electricity as hours of streaming. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, many of the filmmakers I spoke to said they face stigma for experimenting with AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whenever I do post things online, a lot of my filmmaking colleagues have a very knee-jerk reaction to it that we should all hold the line and not use any of these tools,” Tangonan said. “I just don’t agree with that.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If filmmakers are too afraid to discuss how AI can and should be used and what the ethical boundaries are, then the conversation risks being decided for them. Not by artists trying to use it responsibly, but by efficiency-crazed studios that care more about bottom lines than art. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The film industry is floundering because people aren’t innovating and everything costs too much. We need tools like this for it to survive,” said Watmough. “I think it’s essential that people engage with it because if we don’t, then it’s going to become something we don’t recognize, and that’s not sustainable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Ilocano as a Hawaiian dialect of Filipino. Ilocano is a language from the northern Philippines and is widely spoken among Filipino communities in Hawaii.</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-\"><br></h2>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/sequoia-rebrands-china-india-and-southeast-asia-units/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">split from Sequoia Capital in 2023</a>, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a>, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/general-catalyst-commits-5b-to-india-over-five-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion</a> in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm’s priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that’s great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools, and fintech gives it an edge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/peak-xv-says-internal-disagreement-led-to-partner-exits-as-it-doubles-down-on-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent departures</a> of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm’s split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/peak-xv-has-reaped-1-2b-in-the-year-since-it-split-from-sequoia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">returned about $1.2 billion</a> in the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahead of the current raise, Peak XV’s prior fund was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/peak-xv-top-india-sea-venture-firm-trims-fund-size-and-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sized at $2.85 billion</a> in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV’s India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
