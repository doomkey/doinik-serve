This forced Duraisamy to cover significant travel expenses out of pocket and file endless expense reports. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was a constant pain,” Duraisamy explained on the call. “I’d spend my weekends uploading receipts, reconciling every expense manually.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Alaan, the company he launched with fellow McKinsey alumnus <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ae.linkedin.com/in/karun-kurien-3020504b\">Karun Kurien</a>, is the Middle East’s leading spend management platform. It just announced that it raised $48 million in Series A funding led by Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India &amp; SEA) with participation from others like founders of 885 Capital, Y Combinator, 468 Capital, and Pioneer Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders of some of Alaan’s unicorn customers, like Hosam Arab (Tabby), Mudassir Sheikha (Careem), and Khalid Al Ameri, a well-known YouTuber in the region, also invested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is one of the largest Series A rounds for a fintech in the region, compared to Saudi Arabia’s buy now, pay later platform Tamara, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tamara.co/en-SA/press-release-2\">which raised $110 million</a> a couple of years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The category has demonstrated strong product-market fit in the MENA region, and Alaan stands out as the category leader,” said GV Ravishankar, Managing Director at Peak XV. “Their customer-centric and product-led mindset has enabled them to build solutions tailored to modern finance teams.” (Peak XV also participated in a large Series B round last month, backing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/uae-proptech-huspy-raises-59m-to-scale-in-europe/\">UAE’s proptech Huspy</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alaan’s path to category leadership wasn’t without challenges, however.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the fintech raised a $2.5 million seed round in mid-2021, it couldn’t launch for nearly a year, largely due to regulatory complexities and the need for banking partnerships in the UAE. Its recent expansion into Saudi Arabia posed similar hurdles, taking years to secure approvals from the country’s apex bank before finally launching this January. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The biggest challenge we faced, both in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, was simply going live,” the CEO shared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet, Duraisamy said the fintech was able to move fast in other ways such as in Alaan’s pioneering move to integrate Apple Pay into its B2B offerings, something previously unavailable to finance teams in the region. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early 2023, the company also claimed to be the first in the Middle East to integrate OpenAI into its services, a move Duraisamy says shaped the company’s current product strategy. Initially, Alaan rolled out a chatbot, anticipating that users would enjoy conversational interactions around their spending. But the feature failed to gain traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lesson learned, the fintech shifted focus, realizing customers got more value when AI worked in the background. Alaan began using AI to help streamline  processes like receipt matching, reconciliation, and VAT extraction—a particularly valuable use case in the region, where the platform helps businesses navigate complex VAT regulations and reclaimable tax.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims its spend management platform has already saved finance teams more than 1.5 million hours of manual work. Its a number Alaan expects to grow as it continues to invest in automation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching in 2022, Alaan has processed over 2.5 million transactions for more than 1,500 finance teams across major regional enterprises, including G42, Careem, Tabby, and Lulu Group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the company is profitable, Duraisamy says, noting that it spent $5 million to generate $10 million in revenue. Duraisamy credits YC and his mentors for instilling a disciplined approach in a market where many fintechs are focused on payment volumes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Alaan is looking to replicate its growth in Saudi Arabia, where it launched earlier this year and has been doubling transaction volumes month over month for the past six months, according to the startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series A will accelerate this expansion, allowing the company to scale hiring across sales, customer success, and compliance, while also doubling down on AI-driven finance automation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the four-year-old fintech, which is equipping MENA finance teams with AI agents, has now raised one of the largest Series A rounds in MENA, I asked Duraisamy if Ramp’s explosive growth—its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/ramp-hits-22-5b-valuation-just-45-days-after-reaching-16b/\">valuation has doubled this year after raising three rounds</a>—played a role in investors betting big on Alaan.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you talk to investors, what really matters for a company at our stage is the fundamentals: how capital-efficient we are, how much revenue we generate, how strong our go-to-market motion is,” he said. “We are not in a market where you know size is an advantage, like the US or Europe. So, regardless of whether Ramp was able to raise or not, I think we would have raised this much because our fundamentals were very strong.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In the first half of 2025 alone, the startup recorded $250 million in gross merchandise value (GMV), up nearly 1.5 times year-over-year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its digital banking arm, Uzum Bank, launched a co-branded Visa debit card with pre-approved credit limits in August last year. That product has already issued 2 million cards and is on track to surpass 5 million by year-end. Meanwhile, Uzum’s unsecured lending business hit $200 million in financed volume in Q1, growing 3.4 times from the same period last year. The startup also <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/uzum-holding-ltd-uzum-or-the-company-fy2024-results-302385292.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted</a> $150 million in net income in 2024 — a 50% year-over-year jump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a portfolio spanning e-commerce, fintech, and digital banking, how has a startup just over three years old managed to scale this quickly — and draw the attention of global investors like Tencent?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uzum founder and CEO Djasur Djumaev attributes the success to a combination of deep local knowledge and disciplined execution. He believes that understanding the country’s culture, consumer behavior, and business environment — and pairing that with the technical and operational expertise that global companies have developed — has been critical to building a business that can scale quickly and sustainably.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built its digital and physical infrastructure from scratch to kick off its business in Uzbekistan. This includes setting a logistics capacity that has grown to than 112,000 square meters, with a storage capacity of 1.1 million square feet, allowing it to process more than 200,000 orders per day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has also set up more than 1,500 pickup points across 450 cities, towns, settlements, and villages in the country to enable next-day deliveries. These pickup points also allow the issuance and distribution of Uzum Bank cards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Betting on local expertise and infrastructure in frontier markets gives you an advantage to then perform and scale your business very fast,” Djumaev told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033913\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/uzum-pickup-point.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Uzum’s pickup point</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Uzum</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, Uzum operated on a fulfilled-by-operator model to enable e-commerce deliveries. It has since expanded to include fulfillment-by-seller and delivery-by-seller options, with a goal of routing 20–30% of deliveries through these new models. These new delivery models will also help Uzum expand its stock-keeping units, which are currently over 1.5 million available for its next-day delivery service, up from over 600,000 SKUs at the time of its last funding announcement in March 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked what brought Tencent onto its cap-table this time, Uzum’s chief strategy and business development officer, Nikolay Seleznev, told TechCrunch the startup’s strong growth metrics convinced the Chinese investor to come on board after several quarters of ongoing discussions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uzum plans to grow its fintech business by introducing a deposit product in September and a long-term (more than 12 months in maturity) credit facility for its B2C customers. The startup also plans to expand its merchant base and help its existing and new merchants with its QR code payment processing system, expand its Visa debit card program, and build new products to support small and medium enterprises in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, the startup plans to introduce new products adding value-added services to its e-commerce business, including those helping to generate advertisement revenues. It is also working toward scaling its financial infrastructure further with AI increasingly embedded across credit scoring, fraud protection, and personalized user experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Furthermore, Uzum plans to open up its e-commerce marketplace for international merchants, beginning with those in China and Turkey in September.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are expecting 10 to 15% of cross-border activity coming from these countries,” Seleznev said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has over 12,000 people in its workforce, including blue-collar workers at its pickup points, as well as tech, engineering, and product teams across all its business verticals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to other businesses of its sort, which are profitable and have multiple avenues to generate continuous income over time, Uzum has plans to become public in the medium term. But before that, it aims to raise a Series B round of $250–$300 million in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the startup has so far raised $137 million in equity, including the latest round.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That premise has shaped how Sanghavi, the former chief operating officer at Tata Boeing Aerospace, and Mudragalla have built its 100-person workforce, team of advisers, and business model.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033676\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg 1628w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=680,429 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=1200,756 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=1280,807 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=430,271 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=720,454 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=900,567 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=800,504 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=1536,968 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=668,421 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=595,375 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=979,617 979w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=708,446 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/commercial-aerospace-aircraft-deliveries-backlog-mckinsey.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1628px) 100vw, 1628px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>McKinsey Aerospace &amp; Defense Practice</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of working directly with OEMs like Airbus and Boeing, which makes makes 30% of commercial aircraft, Jeh Aerospace deliberately decided to tap Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturers, Sanghavi told TechCrunch, adding this group makes 60% to 70% of aircraft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently has half a dozen paying customers, including Vermont-based GS Precision and Ohio-headquartered RH Aero. Sanghavi said each of these customers is a “high dollar, high ARR customer,” and they have the potential to become large accounts in the next one to two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we believe is that to work with lesser, but better customers, not to have a transactional relationship, but a far deeper and meaningful relationship. So, we are also very, very focused on not having too many customers,” he said. “The business doesn’t need too many customers because you can really scale with few customers very fast and very quickly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also assembled an advisory team with deep ties to commercial aircraft OEMS. The startup counts former Boeing India President Pratyush (Prat) Kumar and former Airbus India CEO and Managing Director Dwaraka Srinivasan among its early advisors and backers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jeh Aerospace has made notable manufacturing and financial progress in its short life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its $2.75 million seed round in January last year, Jeh Aerospace says it has delivered more than 100,000 flight-critical components and tools on time. The startup has also established a machine capacity exceeding 250,000 hours annually.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last financial year, the startup reached $6 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and achieved profitability after taxes. Sanghavi told TechCrunch that it projects a 3x to 4x increase in its ARR this year and also boasts an order book worth $100 million.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033706\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jeh-aerospace-center-for-skill.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Jeh Aerospace’s facility includes an Center for Aerospace Skill for talent training</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jeh Aerospace</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use the new $11 million in capital to scale its manufacturing and inspection capabilities by investing in next-generation digital production technologies, Sanghavi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Jeh Aerospace co-founders see an opportunity to bring more local manufacturing to India and trengthen the country’s position on the global aerospace map, much like its recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/15/trump-tells-apples-ceo-to-stop-expanding-iphone-production-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">emergence as a hub for iPhone production</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India already plays a growing role in aerospace manufacturing, with Airbus <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/airbus-increasing-sourcing-from-india-but-a-plant-will-have-to-wait-ceo/articleshow/119530099.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sourcing $1.4 billion</a> worth of components annually from the country and targeting $2 billion by 2030.

Still, the South Asian nation has yet to achieve large-scale success in aerospace component manufacturing — a gap companies like Jeh Aerospace are hoping to fill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although few Indian startups operate in aerospace component manufacturing, the sector includes players like JJG Aero, which appears to be a peer to Jeh Aerospace based on industry positioning. Sanghavi declined to comment specifically on JJG and noted that his startup sees its primary competition among U.S.-based tier-2 suppliers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Starting in September 2024, Dribbble began pivoting to a marketplace that connected designers and clients. Designers could communicate freely on the platform and then either share a 3.5% revenue cut on clients they converted, or they could pay for <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Pro subscription</a> to skip the rev share. In March, the company tightened the rules further, saying that anyone finding clients on Dribbble would need to offer the platform a cut of their revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It went from it was optional to use our transactional features to it was required for non-advertisers to use our transactional features, if they were on Dribbble, to find clients,” explains <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/canastasakis/\">Dribbble CEO </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/canastasakis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Constantine Anastasakis</a>, in an interview with TechCrunch. “If a user is on Dribbble to find inspiration or to get feedback on their work, or to talk shop with their peers, none of this affects them,” he added.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033928\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg 3378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1200,629 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1280,671 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=720,377 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=900,472 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=800,419 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=2048,1073 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=668,350 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=1178,617 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=708,371 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dribbble.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Dribbble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec, who joined the company after working at direct-to-consumer lender Lower, video marketplace Pond5 (exited to Shutterstock), and freelancer marketplace Fiverr, was hired last April to pivot Dribbble into a marketplace. While the company is profitable under parent company <a href=\"https://www.tiny.com/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tiny</a>, it’s still a small 20-person team and isn’t reliant on venture backing to serve its 7.5 to 10 million monthly unique visitors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Dribbble was something that really accelerated our business dramatically back in the day,” Kuznetsov told TechCrunch. Before Dribbble, there was no platform where designers could share their work with others, he says. It helped designers receive feedback that came specifically from their peers and allowed newer designers to learn from those at the top of the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov is now part of the latter group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Milkinside, Kuznetsov has worked with companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Scandinavian Airlines, United Airlines, Honda, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, and other large companies in the Bay Area. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, he likely didn’t feel that Dribbble would risk banning him for not abiding by the new terms. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anastasakis essentially confirmed this to be true. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He told TechCrunch that Kuznetsov received 83 work inquiries since the new terms rolled out in March, and responded to 61. In each message, the site shows a warning that reminds users that contact details should not be shared before project payment. However, Kuznetsov shared his contact information in six messages, which would have displayed a stronger warning at that time. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

about his repeated terms-of-service violations, which informed him he was risking permanent suspension.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov told us he didn’t see this email initially, but Dribbble says it tracked that the email was opened three times before his suspension. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe that Dribbble — it was their goal to hurt me so I can spread that [news] so they can give a harsh lesson to everyone who tries [to break the rules],” Kuznetsov says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anastasakis confirmed as much to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s really no conceivable way in which he did not realize that what he was doing risked permanent suspension of his accounts,” Anastasakis told us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that ultimately it was that he believed that we wouldn’t take action against a designer of his caliber,” he continued. “As a side note, I actually think that he’s done us a big favor as far as getting the word out about how seriously we take the terms.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Kuznetsov, or any designer who was banned for similar reasons, the only option to come back to Dribbble is by joining as an advertiser, which requires a minimum campaign budget of $1,500 per month for at least three months. </p>\n\n<h2

saying that he’s hurt by Dribbble’s change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not going to be a copycat of Dribbble,” he says of his pending startup. Instead, it will be a resource for designers that will also leverage AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there has been a lot of backlash about AI models training on creatives’ work without compensation, Kuznetsov believes there’s a use case for the technology in terms of inspiration, creation, and design. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1826250\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg 6555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/184A0128-Edit.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Gleb Kuznetsov</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a big hole right now in the market … Everybody’s doing AI startups, but nobody’s really doing AI startups for designers,” Kuznetsov notes. “AI is something that really can elevate our ability to create, and make it on a much higher level of quality. It’s going to help us to not only earn more money and grow, but also create something we never even thought was possible to create without a specific skill set.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuznetsov says he expects to have an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MVP</a> (minimum viable product) ready in three or four months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he notes the goal is not to “kill” Dribbble, even though investors offered him money to do so. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not like that. I’m trying to do something good for the community because I’m a designer. So I know how painful it is to be a designer in this world,” says Kuznetsov. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to be really smart about how we invest our time — how we give our best and give our life to other platforms.

But the simple fact that Big Sleep found these vulnerabilities is significant, as it shows these tools are starting to get real results, even if there was a human involved in this case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To ensure high quality and actionable reports, we have a human expert in the loop before reporting, but each vulnerability was found and reproduced by the AI agent without human intervention,” Google’s spokesperson Kimberly Samra told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Royal Hansen, Google’s vice president of engineering, <a href=\"https://x.com/royalhansen/status/1952424018663162235\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote on X</a> that the findings demonstrate “a new frontier in automated vulnerability discovery.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LLM-powered tools that can look for and find vulnerabilities <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-slop-and-fake-reports-are-exhausting-some-security-bug-bounties/\">are already a reality</a>.

It’s important to note that in most cases, these reports have a human at some point of the process to verify that the AI-powered bug hunter found a legitimate vulnerability, as is the case with Big Sleep.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vlad Ionescu, co-founder and chief technology officer at RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch that Big Sleep is a “legit” project, given that it has “good design, people behind it know what they’re doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is obviously a lot of promise with these tools, but also significant downsides.

The iPhone-maker once promised to build a giant LCD factory in Wisconsin — a project that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called the “eighth wonder of the world” during his first term</a> — and wound up underdelivering to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/12/nx-s1-5359422/what-wisconsins-foxconn-plant-can-tell-us-about-the-future-of-manufacturing-in-the-u-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an extreme degree</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn says the buyer is an “existing business partner” named “Crescent Dune LLC,” an entity that was created in Delaware just 12 days ago, according to records filed with the state. Matt Dewine, a spokesperson for Foxconn, declined to say more about the buyer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn sold the factory and land for around $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million, Taiwan stock exchange filings show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Foxconn representative told <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/an-foxconn-sells-lordstown-plant-hon-hai-ev-taiwan-0804/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Automotive News</a> the company will remain “involved in the manufacturing of products for customers at the Lordstown facility” and claimed it is “committed to customers and suppliers” in the automotive industry. But The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/lordstown-ev-plant-to-be-converted-into-ai-hardware-factory-849eadfa?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiFSyhoRht1TX_V-H1hGJ-jYkL4PNPMup93UlW2B1LohiFNj2V8HlnJY-DNsiA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689100d9&amp;gaa_sig=b44CP77AVuyIDZIOMSJofm2H-hAYI5BihC3_VZ0kzZ_wOmAZt2UOE4hq7xWWnrVET72dkBxzBZpZWMX13qIzsQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported Monday</a> that Foxconn now plans to build AI servers at the factory. Dewine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn announced the deal to buy the former GM plant in 2021 for $230 million, when it was still owned by EV startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said it was going to be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&amp;D hub in North America.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Foxconn was developing EVs of its own in Asia, it was also focused on contract manufacturing in the United States. And, in short order, three of the electric vehicle companies Foxconn hoped would occupy the factory went bankrupt.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn actually built a few EVs at the factory for the now-defunct Lordstown Motors. But the Taiwanese electronics giant wound up in a bitter fight with that troubled EV startup. Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy in June 2023, and accused Foxconn — which had become an investor in the startup — of “starving it of cash,” and said it “maliciously and in bad faith destroyed that business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn also took a flier on a small EV startup called IndiEV, claiming it would build its electric SUV at the Ohio factory. IndiEV filed for bankruptcy in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-03/second-us-foxconn-ev-customer-files-for-bankruptcy-protection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">October 2023</a> with less than $3 million in the bank. Foxconn was supposed to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/foxconn-will-build-evs-for-lordstown-motors-and-fisker-at-ohio-plant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">build EVs for Fisker Inc.</a> as well. Fisker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/fisker-bankruptcy-failure-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed for bankruptcy in June 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A fourth company, Monarch Tractor, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/monarch-tractor-lays-off-10-in-restructuring-towards-software-and-licensing-av-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not had much of an impact</a>, with Foxconn making no more than a few hundred electric tractors.

Rivian is currently able to sell EVs directly to consumers in 25 states and in Washington, D.C. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ohio’s BMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ohio’s prohibition of Rivian’s direct-sales-only business model is irrational in the extreme: it reduces competition, decreases consumer choice, and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience — all of which harm consumers — with literally no countervailing benefit,” lawyers for the company wrote in the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is asking the court to allow the company to apply for a dealership license so it can sell vehicles directly. Ohio customers have to buy from Rivian vehicles from locations in other states where direct sales are allowed. The cars are then shipped to Rivian service centers within Ohio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Allowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. Tesla has had a license to sell in Ohio since 2013 and can sell directly to consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s stopping Rivian is a 2014 law passed by the state’s legislature. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses. (The OADA did not immediately return a request for comment.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America’s economy. Ohio’s archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational, and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience,” Mike Callahan, Rivian’s chief administrative officer, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian has won legal fights over direct sales before. In 2021, Rivian and Lucid Motors were granted dealership licenses to sell EVs in Illinois. That state’s dealer association sued to try to block Rivian and Lucid from selling directly but <a href=\"https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/court-rules-that-rivian-and-lucid-may-sell-vehicles-direct-to-consumers-in-illinois.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ultimately failed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid Motors, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/news/industry-news/a41886748/lucid-motors-lawsuit-texas-dealership-rights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a lawsuit of its own in Texas in 2022</a> in a challenge to that state’s direct-sales ban.

This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: The article was updated to reflect that Amazon denied reports of Wondery shutting down</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He’s pushed hard to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, not a maker of EVs. And yet, the company’s most visible products, which generate the bulk of its revenues, are its electric cars. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, Tesla EVs are advanced, particularly when it comes to its underlying vehicle architecture and software. And its driver-assistance system known as Full Self-Driving Supervised, which can be used on highways and city streets and requires hands on the wheel and the driver to be ready to take over, is considered among the most capable on the market today. But to Musk, the ultimate illustration of an AI and robotics company is self-driving cars and humanoid robots. And today, neither of them exist at any scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s first notable step toward that goal was in June when it launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Those Robotaxi-branded vehicles, which invited customers can hail via an app, have a Tesla employee sitting in the front passenger seat. But it’s still far from Musk’s original vision of a “general solution” that would allow a Tesla owner to earn money by renting out their vehicle as a robotaxi service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The clock is ticking and Musk needs to show more progress — or at the very least tease upcoming launches to keep antsy shareholders content. Which is perhaps why Tesla is embarking on this ride-hailing gambit in California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Musk noted that Tesla would be launching a robotaxi service in the Bay Area<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1943134090179334207\"> “in a month or two”</a> — regulatory approvals being the primary hang-up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem? Tesla hasn’t even applied for the permits that would allow it to operate a robotaxi service. I checked Friday morning with the California DMV, which regulates driverless testing, and Tesla has not yet applied for the necessary permits. (A spokesperson did tell me the DMV met with Tesla to discuss the company’s plans to test autonomous vehicles in the state.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, instead Tesla has launched a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area. And yeah, users keep calling these robotaxis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, while folks — including Musk’s brother and Tesla board member Kimbal Musk — <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/kimbal/status/1951035194984767838\">may refer to these as robotaxis</a>, they are not driving autonomously. (And if they are, it would be a violation of current regulations.) Again, Tesla does not currently have the permits to do anything beyond pay its own employees to use its fleet of EVs to drive people around the Bay Area. No autonomous driving in any way, shape, or form. You can read a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/tesla-wants-to-bring-its-robotaxis-to-san-francisco-heres-whats-standing-in-the-way/\">recent explainer here</a> that will take you through all of the various permits Tesla needs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ride-hailing launch has many folks wondering, what gives?

Logistics company Flexport had captured the attention of Silicon Valley, in part because of founder Ryan Petersen’s fallout with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/ousted-flexport-ceo-dave-clark-strikes-back/\">ousted CEO Dave Clark</a> and because of its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/01/flexport-acquires-technology-of-former-digital-freight-unicorn-convoy/\">acquisition of Convoy</a>, the former freight tech unicorn that had just shut down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s an update. Flexport has now <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/flexport-sells-former-freight-unicorn-convoys-tech-two-years-after-buying-it/\">sold the Convoy platform</a> to <strong>DAT Freight &amp; Analytics</strong>. The terms were undisclosed, although the company said it had delivered a “massive return on investment for Flexport.” Reporting from Axios’ Dan Primack suggests that, yes, indeed “massive return” is an appropriate description. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flexport never disclosed exactly what it had paid for Convoy’s tech, although reporting at the time put the figure at $16 million — a fraction of the unicorn’s previous valuation of $3.8 billion. Primack reported this week that Flexport sold the Convoy platform<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/supply-chain-deals/2025/07/29/flexport-sells-convoy-assets-dat-250m\"> for $250 million</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>AIR</strong>, an Israel-based startup developing eVTOLs,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/air-secures-23m-to-boost-u-s-expansion-and-evtol-innovation/\"> raised $23 million</a> in a Series A funding round led by Entrée Capital, with participation from existing backer Dr. Shmuel Harlap, an early investor in Mobileye. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>LG Innotek</strong>, the components and materials subsidiary of South Korea’s LG Group, is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/aeva-strikes-lidar-chipmaking-deal-with-lg-subsidiary/\">investing up to $50 million</a> in <strong>Aeva</strong>, acquiring an equity stake of about 6% in the U.S. lidar company.

The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages “in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences,” Cloudflare’s researchers wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. In recent times, websites have tried to fight back by using the web standard Robots.txt file, which tells search engines and AI companies which pages can be indexed and which shouldn’t, efforts <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/multiple-ai-companies-bypassing-web-standard-scrape-publisher-sites-licensing-2024-06-21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">that have seen mixed results so far</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots’ “user agent,” meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type, as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,” read Cloudflare’s post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer dismissed Cloudflare’s blog post as a “sales pitch,” adding in an email to TechCrunch that the screenshots in the post “show that no content was accessed.” In a follow-up email, Dwyer claimed the bot named in the Cloudflare blog “isn’t even ours.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity’s known bots. Cloudflare said it then performed tests to check and confirmed that Perplexity was circumventing these blocks. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent, but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked,” according to Cloudflare.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also said that it has de-listed Perplexity’s bots from its verified list and added new techniques to block them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare has recently taken a public stance against AI crawlers. Last month, Cloudflare <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-launches-a-marketplace-that-lets-websites-charge-ai-bots-for-scraping/\">announced the launch of a marketplace</a> allowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Cloudflare’s chief executive Matthew Prince <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/bernard-l-schwartz-annual-lecture-matthew-prince-cloudflare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sounded the alarm</a> at the time, saying AI is breaking the business model of the internet, particularly publishers. Last year, Cloudflare also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/cloudflare-launches-a-tool-to-combat-ai-bots/#:~:text=Cloudflare%20has%20set%20up%20a,demand%20for%20model%20training%20data.\">launched a free tool</a> to prevent bots from scraping websites to train AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not the first time Perplexity is accused of scraping without authorization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, news outlets, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">such as Wired</a>, alleged <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/news-outlets-are-accusing-perplexity-of-plagiarism-and-unethical-web-scraping/\">Perplexity was plagiarizing their content</a>. Weeks later, Perplexity’s CEO Aravind Srinivas <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/perplexitys-ceo-punts-on-defining-plagiarism/\">was unable to immediately answer</a> when asked to provide the company’s definition of plagiarism during an interview with TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey at the Disrupt 2024 conference.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The X owner <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1951697566325981414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> over the weekend that the company discovered the video archive for the popular short-form video app, thought to have been deleted, and is working to restore user access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vine — something of a precursor to today’s TikTok, but with only six-second-long looping videos — was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/if-twitter-gets-into-the-video-hosting-game-it-could-be-a-wonderful-and-horrible-thing/\">acquired by Twitter back in October 2012</a> for $30 million to expand the social media platform’s video ambitions. Unfortunately for Vine creators and fans, the company fumbled the app’s potential and decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/\">shut down Vine in 2016</a> by limiting all new uploads. The following year, it was fully discontinued, though a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/twitter-just-cant-let-go-of-vine-launches-an-online-archive/\">user archive</a> remained for a time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite no longer having an App Store presence, Vine still has a place in the internet’s collective cultural consciousness. Through online compilations of the best Vines uploaded to YouTube, and through the careers of numerous creators who got their start on Vine, the company lives on to some extent, and its content continues to be discovered by new generations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk himself seemed interested in bringing back Vine after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/\">acquiring Twitter in October 2022</a>. In <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1586918804780630016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a poll posted</a> on the social media app, he asked Twitter’s users, “Bring back Vine?” to which nearly 70% responded “yes.” <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/10/31/vine-tiktok-twitter-musk-team-reboot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios reported at the time</a> that Twitter had devoted some engineers to working on the Vine reboot, but nothing ever came of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear whether Musk has any ambitions for Vine beyond getting its archive back online, however. In the same post about restoring Vine, he also touted that Grok’s new video-creation feature, Grok Imagine, also available to X Premium+ subscribers, is “AI Vine.” That suggests that his interests in video creation no longer lie with human creativity, but in human-directed AI prompting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether or not Musk will actually deliver on the promise remains to be seen, as the X post could have just been another way to draw attention to Grok AI, rather than being representative of a real effort inside the company to make old Vines available for reposting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

There are limits to how explicit one can get. Many of our spicier prompts — made in the name of Journalism! — generate blurred-out images that are “moderated” and therefore inaccessible. We were, however, able to generate semi-nude imagery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NSFW content is unsurprising for xAI, given the release last month of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/elon-musks-grok-is-making-ai-companions-including-a-goth-anime-girl/\">raunchy, hyper-sexualized anime AI companion</a>. But just as Grok’s unrestrained nature was entertaining until it started spewing hateful, antisemitic, misogynistic content, Grok Imagine could be poised to bring its own set of unintended consequences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/grok-video-generator-will-spicy-mode-says-xai-employee-rcna221807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC first reported</a> the existence of a “<a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1952171629485711479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spicy mode</a>” last week after xAI employee Mati Roy said in a now-deleted post on X: “Grok Imagine videos have a spicy mode that can <a href=\"https://x.com/dreamworks2050/status/1952301119608398124\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">do nudity</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The existing limitations with Grok Imagine are somewhat heartening given the model also lets you create content of celebrities — anyone from Donald Trump to Taylor Swift — and there appear to be additional restrictions on those. For example, TechCrunch tried, and failed, to generate an image of Trump pregnant. Grok Imagine only generated images of Trump holding a baby or next to a pregnant woman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s still early days for Grok Imagine, which aims to compete with incumbents like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Runway, and Chinese rivals, the images and videos generated of humans are still a bit lost in the uncanny valley, with waxy-looking skin that verges on cartoonish at times. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the generator is impressive. It produces images in seconds from a text prompt, and continues to auto-generate new images as you scroll. Those images can then be animated into stylized videos. The user interface is also seamless and intuitive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk said<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1952104431367208981?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=xai-launches-grok-imagine-video-generator&amp;_bhlid=f6bb04152b3f05dd8588deb56b7dc9a215665d7f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> on X</a> that the model would “get better every day.”</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But earlier this year, Lyft bought its way into the European market when it agreed to acquire the German multi-mobility app FREENOW from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/lyft-to-buy-taxi-app-freenow-for-197m-to-enter-europe/\">about $197 million in cash</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition opened the European market to Lyft, which has only operated in the U.S. and Canada since it launched in 2012.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft and Uber, both of which sunsetted their own internal autonomous vehicle programs, are in a race to lock up partnerships with companies like Baidu, which have developed the technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has partnered with more than 18 companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/how-ubers-new-product-chief-is-gearing-up-for-robotaxis/\">ride-hailing</a>, delivery, and trucking. In this year alone, it has announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/uber-and-volkswagen-pair-up-to-launch-robotaxi-service-with-self-driving-electric-microbuses/\">Volkswagen</a>, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/uber-invests-100m-in-weride-to-fuel-robotaxi-expansion-across-15-more-cities/\">WeRide</a>, and Baidu. Last month, Uber invested <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/uber-makes-multi-million-dollar-investment-in-lucid-nuro-to-build-robotaxi-service/\">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> into EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro in a bid to launch its own premium robotaxi service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft hasn’t had the same pace of deals as Uber, but has made a few partnerships in the past year, including a plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/lyft-to-add-autonomous-shuttles-in-2026-as-uber-inks-more-self-driving-deals/\">add autonomous shuttles</a> made by Austrian manufacturer Benteler Group to its network in late 2026. Lyft has also said it plans to put <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/lyft-partners-with-may-mobility-mobileye-to-bring-autonomous-vehicles-to-the-app/\">AVs from May Mobility</a> on its network in Atlanta later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The aim is to generate funds for North Korea’s sanctioned nuclear weapons program, which has so far made <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">billions of dollars for the regime</a> to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not known exactly how many North Korean IT workers are currently working for unknowing U.S. companies, but some have estimated the number to be in the thousands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to CrowdStrike, the North Korean IT workers, which the company calls “Famous Chollima” using its naming scheme of hacking groups, rely on generative AI and other AI-powered tools to draft resumes and modify or “deepfake” their appearance during remote interviews. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the scheme is not new</a>, North Koreans are increasingly succeeding at getting jobs, despite sanctions preventing U.S. companies from hiring North Korean workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CrowdStrike said in its report that one of the ways to prevent hiring sanctioned workers is by implementing better identity verification processes during the hiring phase. TechCrunch has anecdotally heard of some crypto-focused companies asking prospective employees to say critical things about North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, in an effort to weed out potential spies. The would-be North Korean employees are often highly monitored and surveilled, making any such request impossible and likely outing the fraudulent worker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Justice has sought to disrupt these operations by going after the U.S.-based facilitators who help <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/us-indicts-five-individuals-in-crackdown-on-north-koreas-illicit-it-workforce/\">run and operate the scheme</a> for their North Korean bosses.

Silicon Valley-based OpenMind is focused under the hood.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://openmind.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenMind</a> is building a software layer, OM1, for humanoid robots that acts as an operating system. The company compares itself to being the Android for robotics because its software is open and hardware agnostic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanford professor Jan Liphardt, the founder of OpenMind, told TechCrunch that humanoids and other robots have been around and able to do repetitive tasks for decades. But now that humanoids are being developed for use cases that require more human-to-machine interactions, like having a humanoid in your home, they need a new operating system that thinks more like a human.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of a sudden, this world is opening where machines are able to interact with humans in ways I’ve certainly never before seen,” Liphardt said. “We’re very much believers here that it’s not just about the humans, but we really think of ourselves as a company that is a collaboration between machines and humans.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenMind unveiled on Monday a new protocol called FABRIC that allows robots to verify identity and share context and information with other robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike humans, machines can learn almost instantly, Liphardt said, which means giving them a better way to connect to other robots will allow them to more easily train and absorb new information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liphardt gave the example of languages and how robots could connect to each other and share data on how to speak different languages, which would help them better interact with more people without having to be taught each language by a human directly.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Humans take it for granted that they can interact with any other human on Earth,” Liphardt said. “Humans have built a lot of infrastructure around us that allows us to trust other people, call them, text them, and interact and coordinate and do things together. Machines, of course, are going to be no different.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenMind was founded in 2024 and is gearing up to ship its first fleet of 10 OM1-powered robotic dogs by September. Liphardt said that he’s a big believer in getting the tech out there and iterating on it after the fact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We full well expect all the humans that will be hosting these quadrupeds, they’ll come back with a long list of things they didn’t like or they want, and then it’s up to us to very, very quickly iterate and improve the machines,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also recently raised a $20 million funding round led by Pantera Capital, with participation from Ribbit, Coinbase Ventures, and Pebblebed, among other strategic investors and angel investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company is focused on getting its tech into people’s homes and starting to iterate on the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The most important thing for us is to get robots out there and to get feedback,” Liphardt said. “Our goal as a company is to do as many of these tests as we can, so that we can very rapidly identify the most interesting opportunities where the capabilities of the robots today are optimally matched against what humans are looking for.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Joby.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blade’s medical division, which transports organs, isn’t included in the transaction and will remain a separate company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal gives Joby instant access to a network of 12 terminals in key markets like New York City — notably, a dedicated lounge as well as terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty Airport, the West Side of Manhattan, the East Side of Manhattan, and Wall Street.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blade, founded in 2014, doesn’t own a fleet of aircraft. Instead, the company has developed a digital network that allows passengers to book private rides on helicopters across several short-hop routes. The service has grown in popularity as well-heeled customers seek ways to avoid traffic on their commutes from the suburbs into Manhattan, or to The Hamptons for weekends and holidays. The company, which also offers access to routes from Nice, France, to Monaco and Saint-Tropez, flew more than 50,000 passengers in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt described the deal as a “strategically important” acquisition that will support its launch of its commercial operations in Dubai and subsequent global rollout. The company said it will integrate its software, which is designed to manage air taxi operations, into Blade’s passenger service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joby, founded in 2009 by Bevirt, has been working for more than a decade to develop, certify, and produce an electric vertical take off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial taxi service in cities.
