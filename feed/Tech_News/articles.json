That is what I felt when unboxing Fairphone’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shop.fairphone.com/nl/fairbuds-xl\">new $229 Fairbuds XL over-the-ear headphones</a> in the forest green shade. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new headphones, which also come in black, compete with others on the market, like Nothing Headphones (1), Sony’s previous gen WH-1000XM5, and Sonos Ace. While some of those offer better sound and noise cancellation capabilities, Fairbuds XL would be a good bet if longevity and repairability matter more to you. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new devices are an update to the Fairbuds XL with noise cancellation, first launched in 2023 and designed with repairability in mind. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On these headphones, owners can replace the battery, cushions, speaker covers, headband, and drivers on both the new and older models. To make repairs, you can easily open up the headphones with a guitar pick or a credit card and a basic screwdriver. The company has tutorials on its YouTube channel to guide you through the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new iteration carries that same ethos but includes some subtle design changes as well as a driver upgrade to improve performance. Specifically, the company said that the driver size is still 40mm, but it’s been upgraded with better magnets for improved bass.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite installing new drivers with enhanced bass, the overall sound signature is largely neutral. Both mids and vocals came through while listening to songs. For instance, some of the tracks on the “K-Pop Demon Hunter” album have some bass-heavy sections, but that didn’t cloud the vocals or synth. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074050\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Fairphone</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The design changes include making the speaker-to-speaker cable and the joystick green instead of orange. The company has new ear cushions with mesh material for more comfort. It said that the smoother ear cushion gives you improved voice isolation, but the mesh also makes it more comfortable for long-term wearing. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While I didn’t have the chance to test the first iteration of the headphones, I have worn the current pair for hours at a stretch and didn’t feel any sweat or discomfort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone has included a tactile button and joystick to control media and switch between different noise cancellation modes. You can use the joystick to play and pause, control volume, and switch to the next or previous track. The button also acts as a switch for pairing mode and lets you cycle between noise cancellation modes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone is not alone in prioritizing a functional button. Other hardware makers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/nothing-releases-its-first-over-the-ear-headphones-the-299-headphone-1/\">like Nothing</a>, are now concentrating on adding handy buttons to their headphones, and it’s a welcome move.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074051\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973299100_3d73717ce8_k.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Fairphone</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Fairbuds XL offer very robust active noise canceling. While I work from home, there is a lot of noise in the neighborhood, and I prefer to wear noise-cancellation earbuds or headphones. You won’t get AirPods’ level of noise cancellation with these devices, but the experience was still good. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone CTO Chandler Hatton said that the release cycle of the headphones and backward compatibility is a conscious choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can release the products faster. This is a conscientious decision to do it a little bit more slowly. We’d like to show the industry that it’s not necessary to push products out of the market by introducing a new one, because this creates the cycle of what’s sometimes referred to as planned obsolescence,” she told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company noted that it uses fair-mined and recycled materials to build these pairs of headphones. To reduce packaging waste, its box just contains a simple protective pouch and the headphones themselves, along with a quick start guide. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This company claims the device’s battery life is up to 30 hours, but this is reduced if you have active noise cancellation on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lack of a headphone jack in favor of USB-C bugged me a bit. Even if you don’t want to add extra accessories to your package, adding support for a standard audio jack is something that could also make the headphones compatible with more audio devices. (You can pick up a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle from Fairphone at around $15.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone has gone through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/28/fairphone-ceo-eva-gouwens-to-step-down/\">a few executive</a> changes in the last two years. The company said that the new management wants to prove that it can produce and distribute gadgets at scale, and the U.S. expansion is part of that plan. The headphones are one of the company’s first products to get a full release in the U.S. and will include support for replacement parts and a three-year warranty. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While consumers can buy the Fairbuds XL on Fairphone’s site, the device will launch on Amazon later this month for U.S. customers, along with the company’s $99 wireless earbuds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s one way to look at Tuesday’s announcement from the company formerly known as Facebook: Meta is revamping its flagship app with a number of features focused on connecting friends, along with design changes, including a renewed focus on what still works, like its popular Facebook Marketplace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes come days after news of Meta considering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/meta-reportedly-plans-to-slash-metaverse-budget-by-up-to-30/\">sizable cuts to its metaverse efforts</a>, which, before the AI boom, aimed to make virtual worlds and VR the company’s next big bet in social networking. Meanwhile, Facebook still reaches <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\">billions</a>, even if its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/02/5-facts-about-how-americans-use-facebook-two-decades-after-its-launch/\">growth remains flat</a> in key markets like the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Facebook’s population ages, the app remains in heavy use among boomers and Gen Xers. That’s led Meta to try to find a footing among a younger demographic. After failed attempts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/02/facebook-is-shutting-down-its-college-student-only-social-network-campus/\">reboot Facebook as a home for college kids</a>, the company has been making more noise recently around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/mark-zuckerberg-teases-a-2025-return-to-og-facebook/\">giving Facebook a Gen Z makeover</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s been resonating with younger people <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/business/gen-z-facebook-marketplace.html\">is Facebook Marketplace</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s online marketplace is used by more than half of its Gen Z users in the U.S., according to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/us-social-media-users-by-generation-2025?_gl=1*emvoar*_gcl_au*MTgwMzY4ODczLjE3NjUyMjk5MTQ.*_ga*OTU4NDcyMDc2LjE3NjUyMjk5MTQ.*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*czE3NjUyMjk5MTQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjUyMjk5MTQkajYwJGwwJGgxMDUyNjUyMzU2\">2025 eMarketer report</a> on social media users. Last month, Meta <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/11/facebook-marketplace-gets-a-glow-up/\">confirmed the trend</a>, noting that Marketplace was used by one out of four Facebook young adult daily active users in the U.S. and Canada. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the traction, however, Marketplace has remained buried in the “More” menu under users’ profiles in the Facebook app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new update, rolling out soon, will add Marketplace to the app’s bottom navigation bar, alongside other social and creator-focused features like Reels and Friends.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074131\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg 1454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=768,679 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=1200,1061 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=1280,1132 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=430,380 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=720,637 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=900,796 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=800,708 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=668,591 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=424,375 424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=698,617 698w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=600,531 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reels and direct messaging have been the most popular features on Instagram, the company said earlier this year, which is why it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/instagram-is-testing-a-reels-first-ui-in-india-and-south-korea/\">began testing a redesign that centered those</a> in the mobile experience. Now, Facebook is getting similar treatment in terms of re-centering friends as part of the experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Profile tab will remain in the navigation bar, and users will be able to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/www/2741283262582983\">customize the experience</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another part of the makeover will allow users to double-tap photos in their Feed to like them, similar to Instagram. These photos will be arranged in a standardized grid, and users will be able to see photos full-screen by clicking them.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Feed-Updates_final.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074123\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Search is changing to include a more immersive grid layout to support all content types. Facebook will also test a new full-screen viewer that would let you explore photo and video results without losing your place.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Facebook says it’s making it easier to create Stories and regular posts by making tools for adding music or tagging friends more visible, and eliminating other distractions. Audience and cross-posting settings will now be more prominently displayed, as well.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Feed_creation_final.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074125\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commenting across Feed, Groups, and Reels is getting its own set of tweaks.

The company is now throwing users a bone in terms of new functionality, at least — if you share that you enjoy something like baking your own bread, or are planning a trip to a certain city, for instance, it will connect you with friends who share the interest or who can give tips.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074130\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg 1460w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=300,264 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=768,676 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=680,599 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=1200,1057 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=1280,1127 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=430,379 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=720,634 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=900,793 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=800,705 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=668,588 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=426,375 426w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=700,617 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=603,531 603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Screenshot</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, Facebook has long had the habit of trying to juice engagement by pushing every profile update to your Feed, like if you changed your profile picture or background photo — a feature many Facebook users <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/140uecb/how_do_you_upload_a_new_facebook_cover_photo/\">found</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/how-to-update-cover-photo-on-facebook-without-posting\">annoying</a> and even embarrassing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this revamp, however, users will be able to decide if those updates are shared to their Feed, a decision that could increase adoption, Facebook hopes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes could impact how content is ranked in users’ Feeds, which is already a personalized experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new features will roll out globally over the weeks ahead.

The tech giant hasn’t given up on that dream yet: its AI assistant, Alexa+, is getting new shopping-enabled features in the U.S. and Canada from today, including a shopping hub, tools to add items to recent orders, and personalized recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has already been working on features that make Alexa+ more of a shopping assistant with abilities like automated deal tracking and automatic purchases. The former feature lets you set Alexa to alert you when items in your cart or list drop below a certain price point. If you also have automatic purchases set up, Alexa can immediately order an item when it reaches that target price.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Amazon says it’s turning its Echo devices with a screen — the Echo Show 15 and 21 — into a shopping hub with an interface that it’s calling the “Shopping Essentials” experience. From this dashboard, Amazon shoppers can track deliveries in real time, see information about recent orders, get reminders about household essentials they need to reorder, and view their shopping list and saved items.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?w=680\" alt=\"Echo Show\" class=\"wp-image-2918385\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png 767w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The screen would also let shoppers tap to see more products and add items directly to their cart and then check out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To access the new experience, Amazon users can say “Alexa, where’s my stuff?” or “Open Shopping Essentials.” Soon, a shopping widget will be available to add to the Echo device’s home screen, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another new feature rolling out now will allow Alexa device owners to add items to an upcoming delivery at any time until the item leaves the warehouse. This builds on a similar feature recently added to Amazon’s retail website and app, so it isn’t necessarily an Alexa+ exclusive, but the feature wasn’t live on Alexa devices so far.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ is also gaining the ability to recommend gifts. You’ll be able to describe who you’re shopping for, or the occasion, and Alexa+ will display product suggestions on the screen, organized into categories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says Alexa+ is now available to “tens of millions” of customers, and these new features are live for users in the U.S. and Canada. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1obm7ii/is_there_a_way_to_remove_alexa_and_go_back_to_the/\">While</a> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-out-but-missing-a-lot-of-features-amazon-demoed-last-month-180741504.html\">not</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/1lafqsq/alexa_plus_rollback_to_previous_version/\">everyone</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1ochmnh/i_assume_theres_no_way_to_downgrade_alexa_back_to/\">has</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1l4dyht/tried_alexa_and_downgraded_right_awayshow_15/\">been</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nshk6v/alexa_the_downgrade/\">happy</a> with Alexa+, the company says the percentage of users who <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TxQg5eM59c1YXhLnCu\">downgraded</a> back to the AI-free interface remains in the “very low single digits.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The other model has an in-lens display — which is only visible to the person wearing the glasses — that can show turn-by-turn directions or closed captioning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google also shared a preview of the wired XR glasses from Xreal called Project Aura. This model situates itself between a bulky headset and an unobtrusive pair of glasses. Beyond just an in-lens display, the Project Aura glasses can function as an extended workplace or entertainment device, allowing the user to use Google’s suite of products or stream video as they would in a more advanced headset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta has gotten out to an early lead in smart glasses development, Google now joins <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/apple-could-launch-ai-powered-smart-glasses-in-2026/\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/snap-plans-to-sell-lightweight-consumer-ar-glasses-in-2026/\">Snap</a> among the companies expected to challenge Meta with their own hardware next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s smart glasses have caught on in part thanks to its partnership with Ray-Ban, and it sells these products in retail stores. Google’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-commits-150m-to-develop-ai-glasses-with-warby-parker/\">partnership</a> with Warby Parker seems like it will follow a similar strategy, committing $75 million thus far to support the eyewear company’s product development and commercialization costs. If Warby Parker meets certain milestones, Google will commit an additional $75 million and take an equity stake in the brand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The European Commission <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2964\">has launched an investigation</a> into whether Google may have breached EU’s competition laws by using content from websites without compensating owners to generate answers for its AI summaries that appear above search results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EC also will look at how AI summaries use videos from YouTube to generate answers. The investigation will examine if Google is harming competition in the AI market by granting itself access to websites’ content, and imposing “unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Commission will investigate to what extent the generation of AI Overviews and AI Mode by Google is based on web publishers’ content without appropriate compensation for that, and without the possibility for publishers to refuse without losing access to Google Search,” the bloc’s executive arm wrote in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s AI Overview and AI Mode are the two chief products being investigated here, and the EC highlights that the tech giant doesn’t leave websites or content producers with much choice since it directs a majority of web traffic, doesn’t pay them for using their content, and doesn’t allow YouTube uploads if you don’t let Google use that data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EU is also concerned over the fact that Google doesn’t allow rival AI companies to use YouTube content to train their own AI models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investigation comes at a time when companies developing AI models and content are being sued for copyright infringement by publishers and websites. AI search tool Perplexity, for one, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/the-new-york-times-is-suing-perplexity-for-copyright-infringement/\">has been sued by several  outlets</a>, including the New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, News Corp, New York Post, Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, and Reddit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EU’s investigation differs, however, because in many cases, these media companies are suing as a way to negotiate content-licensing deals with AI firms in hopes of compensating creators and being paid for their content. The EU is seeking to level the playing field for AI companies that compete with Google, which according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cautiousoptimism.news/p/google-sees-more-than-other-ai-companies\">some reports</a>, benefits from its reach by being able to train its AI models on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-matthew-prince-cloudflare/\">much more of the internet</a> than its rivals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under consistent and widespread criticism of its AI regulation, however, the EU is considering <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-ease-ai-privacy-rules-critics-warn-caving-big-tech-trump-2025-11-19/\">simplifying its AI rules</a>, and has proposed to delay the implementation of rules for the use of AI in high-risk applications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Redmond-based company also said it will open a new data center region in Hyderabad by mid-2026, its largest in India, comprising three availability zones — a footprint the company described as roughly the size of two Eden Gardens stadiums. Microsoft said it will continue expanding its three existing data-center regions in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the push, Microsoft also announced it will work with the Ministry of Labour and Employment to integrate advanced AI capabilities into two of its flagship digital public platforms — e-Shram and the National Career Service — to offer AI-driven services to more than 310 million informal workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two Indian government platforms will use Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to provide multilingual access, AI-assisted job matching, predictive analytics on skill and demand trends, automated résumé creation, and personalized pathways, the company said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft also said it is rolling out new sovereign cloud options for Indian customers, including a Sovereign Public Cloud now available across its India regions and a Sovereign Private Cloud powered by Azure Local for both connected and air-gapped operations. The offerings would help enterprises meet regulatory and data-residency requirements and support high-performance workloads with access to the latest Nvidia GPUs and Microsoft 365 services, the company noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Microsoft said its skilling efforts are also accelerating, noting that through its “ADVANTA(I)GE India” initiative, it has trained 5.6 million people since January — well ahead of its goal of training 10 million by 2030 — with the programs enabling more than 125,000 individuals to secure jobs or start businesses. The company is doubling its earlier commitment and now aims to equip 20 million Indians with basic AI skills by 2030, working with government agencies, industry partners, and digital public platforms to broaden access to training.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-attracts-global-tech-firms-in-the-ai-era\">India attracts global tech firms in the AI era</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s investment commitment comes just months after Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced a $15 billion plan</a> to build an AI hub and data-center infrastructure in India — the company’s largest investment in the country and one that follows its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earlier $10 billion pledge</a> in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the recent months, India has emerged as an especially attractive market for global tech companies as they look for regions to expand their AI footprint, drawn by the country’s vast base of internet subscribers, hundreds of millions of smartphone users, a fast-growing startup ecosystem, and the Indian government’s aggressive digitization agenda — all of which promise both consumer scale and enterprise demand. The push has accelerated this year, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic</a> setting up offices in India, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/google-partners-with-ambanis-reliance-to-offer-free-ai-pro-access-to-millions-of-jio-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/perplexity-sees-india-as-a-shortcut-in-its-race-against-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Perplexity</a> striking partnerships with major telecom operators Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to deepen their reach in the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, even as global tech firms ramp up investment, hyperscalers are expected to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-file-100-billion-data-centre-boom-tests-resource-limits-2025-12-03/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">face significant constraints</a> in India, where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr417pwek7o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">data-center expansion is challenged</a> by <a href=\"https://www.forbesindia.com/photogallery/news/in-numbers-indias-data-centre-power-challenge/2988674/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">patchy power availability</a>, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating expenses for cloud providers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, the Indian government has been <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366629299/India-revives-national-datacentre-policy-amid-AI-push\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pushing aggressively</a> to draw more big-tech investment, framing large-scale data-center and AI projects as central to its economic and digital-public-infrastructure ambitions. Despite the constraints, New Delhi has rolled out incentives for AI and semiconductor projects, eased some regulatory hurdles, and encouraged partnerships with domestic telecom and IT firms to anchor more of the global AI value chain in India.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Microsoft has been part of India’s fabric for more than three decades,” said Puneet Chandok, president, Microsoft India and South Asia, in a prepared statement. “As the nation moves confidently into its AI-first future, we are proud to stand as a trusted partner in advancing the infrastructure, innovation, and opportunity that can power a billion dreams.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft already employs more than 22,000 people across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, Noida, and other cities, including engineering teams that build AI products such as Copilot Studio, Azure AI Search, AI agents, speech and translation tools, and Azure Machine Learning for global markets, while also supporting the company’s domestic operations.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He noted that the company had been EBITDA-positive for three of the past four years. And despite a decline in consumer business, other lines saw growth, even if it was not to the company’s liking. In the memo, he also claimed that VSCO’s core app is installed on more U.S. devices than Reddit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company told TechCrunch that the layoffs impacted its marketing, tech, and program management teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Last week, VSCO said goodbye to 24 employees as a result of a company restructure [sic],” Wittman said in an emailed statement. “Valued members across all departments were impacted. Every person leaving has contributed meaningfully to VSCO and our mission, and we are deeply grateful for their impact. The company is restructuring and adjusting internal operations to be more efficient and effective in delivering long-term success and value for photographers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To succeed over the next 5 years, we need to operate as an AI-native company, taking bold but focused bets and strengthening the foundation we’ve built through our Pro business, AI Lab, TFP, and Sites,” Wittman wrote in the memo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">VSCO said that to power growth, it wants to increase brand awareness as well as work on AI-powered features across the line. The company plans to work on a revamped “AI native” editor, and build an AI assistant that could help users complete tasks across its tools. The startup also plans to redesign its public Photo Galleries feature, which lets photographers curate their portfolio and showcase their work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, VSCO launched a marketplace to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/vsco-launches-a-new-hub-to-connect-creators-and-brands/\">connect photographers and brands for projects</a>. This year, VSCO focused on shipping AI-powered products such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/vsco-is-launching-an-ai-powered-collaborative-moodboard/\">Canvas for collaboration</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/vsco-gets-ai-editing-chops-support-for-raw-files/\">new editing features</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As consumer apps like Canva, Google Photos, and Adobe Lightroom focus on adding AI features to their products, it appears VSCO may have realized that instead of AI chops, carving a niche for itself by providing better tools and a dedicated platform for pro photographers would be a good strategy.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The proposal argues that this “mandatory blanket license” would lower compliance costs for AI firms while ensuring that writers, musicians, artists, and other rights holders are compensated when their work is scraped to train commercial models.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s proposal comes amid mounting concerns in global markets over how AI companies train their models on copyrighted material, a practice that has triggered lawsuits from authors, news organizations, artists, and other rights holders in the U.S. and Europe. Courts and regulators are still weighing whether such training qualifies as fair use, leaving AI firms operating under legal uncertainty and allowing them to rapidly expand their business without clear regulations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the U.S. and the European Union, where policymakers are debating transparency obligations and fair-use boundaries, India is proposing one of the most interventionist approaches yet by giving AI companies automatic access to copyrighted material in exchange for mandatory payment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The eight-member committee, formed by the Indian government in late April, argues the system would avoid years of legal uncertainty while ensuring creators are compensated from the outset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Defending the system, the committee says in a <a href=\"https://www.dpiit.gov.in/static/uploads/2025/12/ff266bbeed10c48e3479c941484f3525.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">125-page submission</a> (PDF) that a blanket license “aims to provide an easy access to content for AI developers… reduce transaction costs… [and] ensure fair compensation for rightsholders,” calling it the least burdensome way to manage large-scale AI training. The submission adds that the single collecting body would function as a “single window,” eliminating the need for individual negotiations and enabling royalties to flow to both registered and unregistered creators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The committee also points to India’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/29/billionaire-ambani-taps-google-meta-to-build-indias-ai-backbone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">growing importance as a market for GenAI tools</a>. Citing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s remark that India is the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. and “may well become our largest,” it argues that because AI firms derive significant revenue from Indian users while relying on Indian creators’ work to train their models, a portion of that value should flow back to those creators. That, it says, is part of the rationale for establishing a “balanced framework” that guarantees compensation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s proposal lands amid intensifying legal battles worldwide over whether AI companies can lawfully use copyrighted material to train their models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In India, news agency ANI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/indian-news-agency-sues-openai-alleging-copyright-infringement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sued OpenAI in the Delhi High Court</a>, arguing its articles were used without permission — a case that has prompted the court to examine whether AI training is itself an act of reproduction or protected by “fair dealing.” Courts in the U.S. and Europe are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/court-rules-that-openai-violated-german-copyright-law-ordered-it-to-pay-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">confronting similar disputes</a>, with creators alleging that tech companies have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/the-new-york-times-wants-openai-and-microsoft-to-pay-for-training-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">built their models on unlicensed content</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-proposal-sees-pushback-and-dissent\">AI proposal sees pushback and dissent </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not everyone is convinced by the Indian government’s proposed model, though. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nasscom, the industry body representing technology firms including Google and Microsoft, filed a formal dissent arguing that India should instead adopt a broad text-and-data-mining exception that would allow AI developers to train on copyrighted content as long as the material is lawfully accessed. It warned that a mandatory licensing regime could slow innovation and said rightsholders who object should be allowed to opt out rather than force companies to pay for all training data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Business Software Alliance, which represents global tech firms including Adobe, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft, pressed the Indian government to avoid a purely licensing-based regime. It urged India to introduce an explicit text-and-data-mining exception, arguing that “relying solely on direct or statutory licensing for AI training data may be impractical and may not yield the best outcomes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Limiting AI models to smaller sets of licensed or public-domain material, BSA warned, could reduce model quality and “increase the risk that outputs simply reflect trends and biases of the limited training data sets,” adding that a clear TDM exception would better balance innovation and rights holders’ interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The committee did not consider both a broad text-and-data-mining exception and an opt-out model, arguing that such systems either undermine copyright protections or are impossible to enforce. Instead, it proposed a “hybrid model” that would grant AI firms automatic access to all lawfully available copyrighted works while requiring them to pay royalties into the central collecting body that distributes the proceeds to creators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government has now opened the proposal for public consultation, giving companies and other stakeholders 30 days to submit their comments. After reviewing the feedback, the committee will finalize its recommendations before the framework is taken up by the government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI and Google did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

(And this is a press-and-<em>hold</em> gesture, too, which means you can’t start the ring’s recording and then let go to surreptitiously record a conversation.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073863\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-polished-gold-rocks.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Core Devices LLC</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can wear the stainless steel ring while in the shower, washing hands, doing dishes, or in the rain, but you would have to take it off for other water-related activities, like swimming. At launch, it’s water-resistant to 1 meter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring is also not a fitness tracker or sleep monitor. It doesn’t record details about your heart rate or health. And it’s not there to be your AI friend. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m not trying to build some AI assistant thing,” Migicovsky told TechCrunch in an interview. “I build things that solve one main problem, and they solve it really well,” he explains. “I think of [the ring] as external memory for my brain…that’s what this is. It’s always with you.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, the ring has been designed to be highly reliable and privacy-preserving, he says, as all your thoughts are stored on your phone, not in the cloud. There is no subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky’s ring enters a growing market for voice-note wearables. Last month, Sandbar, a New York-based startup founded by former Meta employees, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">unveiled its Stream Ring</a>, which also lets users record thoughts via a touch-activated microphone. However, unlike Index 01’s no-subscription model, Sandbar’s $249 ring offers both a free tier with limited AI interactions and a $10-per-month Stream Pro subscription for unlimited chats and early access to features. The Stream Ring is expected to ship next summer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky has been wearing his own ring for three months now and says he cannot imagine going back to a world where he doesn’t always have a memory device with him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The problem is that, during the day, I get ideas or I remember something, and if I don’t write it down that second, I forget it,” he says. The ring solves this problem, he adds, without becoming another device you need to charge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The battery lasts for years,” Migicovsky claims. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring is said to support roughly 12 to 14 hours of recording. On average, the founder says he uses it 10 to 20 times per day to record 3-to-6-second thoughts. At that rate, he’ll get about two years of usage. When the ring’s battery dies, you can ship it back to the company for recycling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When using the Index, you can record up to five minutes of audio, which can be saved to the ring and synced to your phone later. This makes sense for recording briefer, personal thoughts and notes, even when you don’t have your phone handy, but it wouldn’t work for recording a longer chat, like a presentation, meeting, or in-person interview of some kind.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073862\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Core Devices LLC</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring also supports more than 100 languages and has a bit of on-device memory for times when you’re not in Bluetooth range of your device, where the recording is ultimately saved and transcribed. (The raw audio is retained, too, in case the speech-to-text is garbled due to loud background noise.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you own a Pebble smartwatch or one from another brand, your recorded thought can even appear on the watch’s screen so you can verify it’s correct. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring works with Pebble’s mobile app, which offers notes and reminders, but can optionally integrate with your phone’s calendaring system, too, or other apps, like Notion. And the ring’s software is open source, which makes it hackable by the community, the founder points out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because of its open nature, the ring’s button is already programmable. In addition to the press-and-hold gesture, you can program the ring to do other things with a single or double press, like play or pause your music or control the shutter on your phone’s camera. You could use it to send a message through the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/pebble-founder-launches-beeper-a-universal-chat-app-that-works-with-imessage-and-others/\">universal chat app Beeper,</a> which Migicovsky also created, or you could add your own voice actions via <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\">MCP</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073865\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=768,705 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=680,624 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=430,395 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=720,661 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=900,826 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=800,734 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=668,613 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=409,375 409w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=672,617 672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=578,531 578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=50,46 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Core Devices LLC</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-approach-to-hardware\">A new approach to hardware </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky acknowledges that hardware can be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/23/smartwatch-firm-pebble-lays-off-25-of-its-staff/\">difficult</a> to get right, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/fitbit-pebble-acquisition/\">Pebble’s exit to Fitbit</a> showed. (Fitbit was later acquired by Google in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/googles-fitbit-acquisition-is-official/\">2021</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I didn’t earn any money during Pebble — we exited, but it was not a great exit,” Migicovsky admits.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, however, he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/smartwatch-pioneer-and-kickstarter-darling-pebble-is-returning-in-a-new-form/\">decided to reboot the Pebble project</a> after Google open-sourced PebbleOS, which opened the door to new hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With his new company, Core Devices, Migicovsky plans to do things differently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the founder doesn’t regret his previous choices, he clarifies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I wouldn’t have gone back and changed anything. I loved what we built. I loved what we did. I love the company that we built, but it’s not the only way to build a company,” he told TechCrunch. “And speaking as an ex-YC partner, there’s a time and a place for building a venture-backed startup. Some companies are phenomenal when they raise money and build a big team, and I tried that…What I’m doing now is trying an alternative path, which is [to] start from profitability,” he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new company is a small team of five, self-funded, and focused on sustainability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Core Devices has shipped the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pebbles-smartwatch-is-back-pebble-time-2-specs-revealed/\">Pebble 2 Duo smartwatch</a> with a black-and-white display. Its first run sold out, and the company is now preparing to ship the upgraded version, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pebbles-smartwatch-is-back-pebble-time-2-specs-revealed/\">Pebble Time 2</a>. The newer device, which has seen 25,000 pre-orders, is a stainless steel watch with a larger, color e-ink screen.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the Index 01, the ring’s pre-order offer ends in March 2026. After that, the price increases to $99. It currently comes in silver, polished gold, and matte black and works with iOS and Android devices. Customers can select from eight ring sizes, ranging from 6 to 13.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Similar to its AI assistant, Le Chat, which can <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/02/mistral_ais_le_chat_can/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remember previous conversations</a> with users and use that context to guide its answers, Vibe CLI features persistent history and can scan file structures and Git statuses to build context to inform its behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This focus on production-grade workflows also explains why Devstral 2 is relatively demanding, requiring at least four H100 GPUs or equivalent for deployment, and weighing 123 billion parameters. However, the model is also available in a smaller size with Devstral Small, which, at 24 billion parameters, makes it deployable locally on consumer hardware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models differ in their open source licensing — Devstral 2 ships under a modified MIT license, while Devstral Small uses Apache 2.0.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also differ in pricing. Devstral 2 is currently free to use via the company’s API. After the free period, the API pricing will cost $0.40/$2.00 per million tokens (input/output) for Devstral 2, and $0.10/$0.30 for Devstral Small.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mistral has partnered with agent tools Kilo Code and Cline to release Devstral 2 to users, while Mistral Vibe CLI is available as an extension in Zed for use inside the IDE.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Europe’s champion AI lab, Mistral is currently valued at €11.7 billion (approximately $13.8 billion) following a Series C funding round <a href=\"https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2025/ASML-Mistral-AI-enter-strategic-partnership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">led by Dutch semiconductor company ASML</a>, which invested €1.3 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) in September.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The first lesson was knowing the difference between what businesses need versus what sounds visionary; the second was that the fundamentals always apply, even with new technologies such as AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Security, compliance, reliability, quality, those things don’t just go away for enterprise applications,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After CodeSee was acquired in 2024, Leven decided that she wanted to build a product that would let business owners, even those without technical backgrounds, build AI applications. She teamed up with AI researcher Sean Robinson, and last October, the two launched <a href=\"https://empromptu.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Empromptu,</a> an AI service that businesses can use to build AI applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Empromptu claims all a user has to do is tell the platform’s AI chatbot what they want — like a new classification app or a generative recommendation app — and the tool will go ahead and build it. It also provides LLM tools to help users if they want to fine-tune any results and lets companies add AI features to their own existing code bases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leven doesn’t consider it a vibe-coding platform, though she does look to compete with companies like Replit and Lovable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Vibe coding is excellent for quick experiments, but Empromptu is what turns those experiments into real software,” she said. Empromptu, she continued, “turns ideas into production features with built-in evaluation, governance, and self-improvement. You ship to real customers, with real data and complete control. If vibe coding is the brainstorm, Empromptu is the build.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, the company said it had raised $2 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Precursor Ventures. Zeal Capital, Alumni Ventures, FoundersEdge, and South Loop also participated. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leven said the fresh capital will be used for hiring staff and developing new proprietary technology. It also announced three new features, including the ability to create custom data models and infinite memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is hoping to target businesses launching in regulated industries or “deeply complex” areas that involve capturing data and creating applications — software that services hotels, for example.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Leven hopes that founders feel their businesses can be transformed without having to learn the technical skills to take advantage of the AI revolution.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s just like any other skill,” Leven said. “And the beauty of this skill is that AI can help you learn it along the way.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to clarify what Empromptu does. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The agency also ordered Zuckerman to delete all the data collected by SpyFone, as well as to undergo frequent audits and establish certain cybersecurity practices for his businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“SpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,” said Samuel Levine, then acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company’s slipshod security.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2025-0198-0001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In his petition</a>, Zuckerman claimed that the FTC order’s security requirements have made it harder for him to run his other businesses due to financial costs, despite the fact that Support King is no longer in operation and he now only runs a restaurant and plans other “tourism ventures” in Puerto Rico, according to the petition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached via email, Zuckerman declined to comment and referred questions to his lawyer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FTC ban stemmed from an incident in 2018, when <a href=\"http://vice.com/en/article/spyware-company-spyfone-terabytes-data-exposed-online-leak/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a security researcher found an Amazon S3 bucket belonging to SpyFone</a> that left extremely sensitive data — including selfies, text messages, chat app messages, audio recordings, contacts, location, hashed passwords and logins, and more — exposed online for anyone to see and access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposed data included 44,109 unique email addresses and, according to the researcher who found the breach, “at least 2,208 current ‘customers’ and hundreds or thousands of photos and audio in each folder” from 3,666 phones that had the SpyFone stalkerware installed on them.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about stalkerware makers?

In 2022, TechCrunch received a trove of breached data from stalkerware app SpyTrac. The data revealed that SpyTrac was run by freelance developers with direct ties to Support King, in what appeared to be an attempt to circumvent the FTC’s ban. Furthermore, the breached data included records from SpyFone, which Zuckerman was ordered to delete, and keys to access the cloud storage of OneClickMonitor, another one of his stalkerware apps. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eva Galperin, a prominent expert on stalkerware, celebrated the news. “Mr. Zuckerman was clearly hoping that if he laid low for a few years, everyone would forget about the reasons why the FTC issued a ban not only against the company, but against him specifically,” Galperin told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch’s revelation in 2022 that Zuckerman apparently violated the FTC ban, “suggests that Zuckerman did not learn his lesson,” added Galperin, who is the director of cybersecurity at the digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stalkerware apps allow their customers to surreptitiously spy on the phones and devices of their loved ones. In addition to enabling potentially illegal activities, for the last eight years, there have been at least 26 stalkerware companies that have been hacked or left sensitive data exposed online, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to TechCrunch’s tally</a>. These repeated incidents show these companies have repeatedly failed to protect the privacy of their customers, as well as the people they spy on.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, we have a firmer grasp on those weekly ride numbers, thanks to a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management to it investors that was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/tiger-global-new-fund-ai-valuations.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported by CNBC</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter was an appeal for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/tiger-global-plans-cautious-venture-future-with-a-new-2-2b-fund/\">investment into Tiger Global’s next venture capital fund</a> and called out the gains, so far, of its current fund. Those gains rested largely on its investments in hot companies like OpenAI, Databricks, and Waymo.

The U.S. will take a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/trump-nvidia-h200-sales-china.html\">25% cut of these sales</a>, CNBC reported. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">H200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-could-approve-h200-exports-134428252.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VtYWZvci5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHQRzQWH648Ene_VMBSBfOA1fid50bu8Hb3ALtkTEIKdeKv-s6Si4ir5zNsapSNBc-YgZMpPmPWWntJoCduvgnYdADn9-1qOV5PvMopSq_YBi8D2gaJ4H1CK3dPGSlb0tgkE8WhnjFwugX1FV5uFst-wv7A2AzcC7lZ1ny9Ei7Ha\">was in President Donald Trump’s hands</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e4e4799-b340-4cee-bdbc-6a6325f77eac\">block the export of advanced AI chips</a> to China for more than two years.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It’s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration hit chip companies like Nvidia with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/\">licensing requirements</a> to send their chips to China in April before it formally <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/\">rescinded a Biden administration diffusion rule</a> that would have regulated AI chip exports in May.

Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction.

Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In our opinion, Mr. Bach’s legal claims are absurd,” the company said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We are confident that the facts revealed through the course of litigation will establish the legitimate issues leading to Mr. Bach’s termination.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors’ press release from that day only said he had “departed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors. The company is burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV. It is developing more affordable mass-market vehicles on a midsized platform slated to debut sometime in late 2026.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid has also been churning through executives. The company’s VP of engineering left on the same day Bach claims to have been fired, as TechCrunch previously reported. Former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February, and the company has still not named a permanent replacement. Lucid’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing all left within the last year, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bach, in the complaint, claims to have been ascendant before the internal investigation. An engineer who spent a decade with the company, Bach says he oversaw “all hardware engineering,” “product management and corporate planning.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bach states that Lucid’s chairman Turqi Alnowaiser “praised Bach’s loyalty and dedication to the Company and expressed a desire to continue working with Bach.” He also claims board member Andrew Liveris “signaled that Bach would become Chief Technology Officer (the position ‘is yours to lose’) and that Bach could one day become Chief Executive Officer,” according to the complaint.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The workplace culture investigation launched in late 2024, which Bach claims was “tainted by HR’s racist beliefs,” “initially resulted in Bach losing significant responsibilities.” The HR department told Bach at the time that he contributed to a poor culture at the company, according to the complaint. In addition to losing oversight of the powertrain team, Bach claims to have been excluded from board meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with a comment from Lucid Motors.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/tiger-global-hit-by-17b-hedge-fund-losses-has-nearly-depleted-its-latest-vc-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch reported</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/tiger-global-secondaries-direct-stakes-sales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">315 startups</a>, according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratcheted up valuations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When interest rates rose, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/a-new-disclosure-shows-again-how-badly-tigers-pray-and-spray-fund-performed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">party was over, and startups spent years</a> trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/26/2025-will-likely-be-another-brutal-year-of-failed-startups-data-suggests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">many shuttering along the way</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/03/john-curtius-is-leaving-tiger-global-to-start-his-own-venture-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">left to start his own fund</a>, and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/21/tiger-global-chieftain-scott-shleifer-transitions-to-advisory-role-after-wild-ride/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transitioned to an advisory role</a>, while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tiger Global went on to raise a much smaller PIP 16 fund of $2.2 billion in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-01/tiger-global-vc-fund-closes-63-below-target-with-2-2-billion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reported</a> at the time, which is, admittedly, still an enormous fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, on the strength of PIP 16’s blockbuster AI investments, Tiger Global is raising Fund 17. PIP 16 holds stakes in OpenAI, Waymo and Databricks, all of which have had skyrocketing valuations and driven this fund’s paper gains by 33% so far, the letter said as reported by CNBC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, in a nod to the need for more caution than in previous years, the letter promised a more targeted approach. It acknowledged that leaning into AI investments could be risky and require “humility” because “valuations are elevated and, in our view, sometimes unsupported by company fundamentals,” according to CNBC. (Tiger Global could not be immediately reached for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, even as Tiger Global raises a fresh fund to go after more big AI opportunities, it’s implying that the AI market is in a bubble, and it doesn’t want to drive valuations to even higher, perhaps unrealistic, heights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
