Users will be able to switch between watching and listening to shows in the Apple Podcasts app, which will begin using the company’s HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video technology. Users can also switch to a horizontal version of the podcast and download videos to watch offline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as video podcasting continues to gain popularity. <a href=\"https://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/The-Podcast-Consumer-2025-revised-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Edison Research</a> recently revealed that 51% of the U.S. population has consumed a video podcast, and that 37% consume video podcasts monthly.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093443\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1095,617 1095w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-enables-video_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated video podcast experience will allow Apple to better compete with the likes of YouTube, Spotify, and even Netflix, all of which have already embraced the format. YouTube announced last year that it has more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/youtube-surpasses-1-billion-monthly-podcast-viewers/\">1 billion monthly active viewers</a> of podcast content. Spotify said last November that it has half a million video podcasts, which nearly 400 million users have watched. As for Netflix, the streaming giant has partnered with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/netflix-doubles-down-on-video-podcasts-with-iheartmedia-deal/\">iHeartMedia</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\">Spotify</a> to bring video podcasts to its platform.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing an enhanced video podcast viewing experience to its app, Apple is aiming to keep users from turning to rival platforms to watch their favorite shows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, in a press release. “Today marks a defining milestone in that journey. By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we’re putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the new video experience will officially launch in the spring, the update is available to test starting this week as part of betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and visionOS 26.4.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

To attract investment, the government is rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support aimed at pulling more of the global AI value chain into the South Asian nation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s pitch comes as U.S. technology giants, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/amazon-to-invest-additional-35b-in-india-by-2030-taking-total-planned-spending-to-75b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-to-invest-17-5b-in-india-by-2029-as-ai-race-accelerates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft</a>, have already <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2216901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">committed about $70 billion</a> to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country, giving New Delhi a foundation to argue it can combine scale, cost advantages, and policy incentives to attract the next wave of global AI computing investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the bulk of the projected $200 billion is expected to flow into AI infrastructure — including data centers, chips, and supporting systems, and encompassing the around $70 billion already <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/26/india-ai-google-microsoft-amazon/\">pledged</a> by Big Tech companies — Vaishnaw said the Indian government also anticipates an additional $17 billion of investment into deep-tech and AI applications, highlighting a push to move beyond infrastructure and capture more of the value chain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The effort is backed by recent policy decisions <span>aimed at making India a more attractive base for AI computing, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/india-offers-zero-taxes-through-2047-to-lure-global-ai-workloads/\" target=\"_blank\">long-term tax relief for export-oriented cloud services</a> and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/india-doubles-down-on-state-backed-venture-capital-approving-1-1b-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">₹100 billion (</a>about</span> $1.1 billion) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/india-doubles-down-on-state-backed-venture-capital-approving-1-1b-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">government-backed venture program</a> targeting high-risk areas such as AI and advanced manufacturing. Earlier this month, New Delhi also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/india-has-changed-its-startup-rules-for-deep-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">extended the period for which deep-tech companies</a> qualify as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.08 million).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have seen VCs committing funds for dtech startups,” Vaishnaw said at a press briefing on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. “We have seen VCs and other players committing funds for big solutions, big applications. We have seen VCs committing funds for further research in cutting-edge models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India plans to <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2229171\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">scale its shared compute capacity</a> under the IndiaAI Mission beyond its existing 38,000 GPUs, the minister said, with an additional 20,000 units to be added in the coming weeks, signalling what he described as the next phase of the country’s AI strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, Vaishnaw said the Indian government is preparing a second phase of its AI Mission, with a stronger focus on research and development, innovation, and wider diffusion of AI tools, alongside further expansion of shared compute capacity, as India seeks to broaden access to AI infrastructure beyond a small group of companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push also faces structural challenges, including access to reliable power and water for energy-intensive data centres, underlining the execution risks as India seeks to compress years of AI infrastructure build-out into a much shorter timeframe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vaishnaw acknowledged those challenges, saying the government was cognizant of the pressure AI infrastructure would place on power and water resources, and pointed to India’s energy mix — with more than half of installed generation capacity coming from clean sources — as an advantage as demand from data centers rises.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether India can deliver on that vision will matter well beyond its borders, as companies seek new locations for AI computing amid rising costs, capacity constraints, and intensifying global competition.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company also spun out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">hardware to a new entity called Specs last month</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company added that it plans to expand the program to Snap Stars in Canada, the U.K., and France in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rival company Meta also allows creators to offer subscriptions on platforms like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://help.instagram.com/856296695055001\">Instagram and Facebook</a>, which gives users access to exclusive content and badges. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He, too, had a non-compete, but was noodling on ideas for a company. He knew Heckler, as Akintolayo had once served as an advisor on one of his projects. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this downtime, however, they wanted to come together — Heckler, with his connections, and Akintolayo, with his knowledge of AI and supply chains — to try and build something new. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result was SpendRule, launched last summer as an AI-powered platform that helps healthcare systems track their spending. The company emerged from stealth on Tuesday, with $2 million in funding in a round led by Abundant Venture Partners. Others in the round include MemorialCare Innovation Fund and Zeal Capital Partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, if an item has a barcode, health systems use a three-way match, Akintolayo, the company’s CTO, said, which connects a purchase to an invoice. But a lot of the time, health systems have purchases and contracts (such as maintenance, janitorial, translation services, or laundry) that lack bar codes or easily identifiable purchase receipts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because these types of purchases can often be tricky and complex to manage, overspending is quite common. SpendRule is a technology that ensures hospitals pay only what was negotiated in their contracts. It is integrated with and operates on top of a hospital system’s current enterprise resource planning software, contract management software, and accounts payable workflows, pulling information from contracts, invoices, internal databases, and vendor data to validate invoices before payment is released. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It flags discrepancies and tells teams when to pay and when not to. Typically, hospitals hire an auditor every 2 years to perform this function or manually review each invoice. It was a tedious task bound to be automated in this current wave of AI. Already, big names like Kettering Health, MemorialCare, and MUSC Health are using the platform, Akintolayo said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heckler and Akintolayo started the company only last summer but managed to close a round by Halloween, mainly due to Heckler’s industry connections. “We were able to painlessly close that initial round and use that to grow the team to support the customers,” he said. The new capital will be used to hire and continue developing the company’s AI infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heckler said SpendRule considers existing invoice auditors its competition, such as SpendMend and GHX. But Akintolayo said again, one main difference is SpendRule’s focus on purchase services, the type of items hospitals buy that do not have barcodes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to build a more resilient hospital system,” Akintolayo said. “That’s our vision. To protect the bottom line of everyone by connecting their data and helping them make better decisions.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Emergent claims its users have created over 7 million applications on its platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nearly 40% of Emergent’s users are small businesses, and about 70% have no prior coding experience. People mostly use the platform to digitize operations previously run on spreadsheets, email or messaging apps, and to build custom software, co-founder and CEO Mukund Jha told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emergent’s rapid growth comes as interest in “vibe-coding,” or using AI to code software, skyrockets around the world. The demand seems to be mostly driven by non-technical users who want to build production-ready applications using natural language and AI agents, though plenty of developers have turned to using such platforms to reduce their workloads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup competes with the likes of Replit, Lovable, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/\">Rocket.new</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/replika-founder-raises-20m-pre-seed-for-wabi-the-youtube-of-apps/\">Wabi,</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/vibe-coding-startup-anything-nabs-a-100m-valuation-after-hitting-2m-arr-in-its-first-two-weeks/\">Anything</a>, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jha said most users on Emergent are building business-facing apps such as custom CRMs, ERPs, and inventory management and logistics tools. About 80% to 90% of new projects are focused on mobile apps, reflecting demand for software that can be deployed quickly and used on the go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emergent generates revenue through a mix of subscriptions, usage-based pricing, and deployment and hosting fees, Jha said, adding that all three segments are growing rapidly and that the company’s gross margins are improving every month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Growth is accelerating,” Jha told TechCrunch. “As the models and platforms are improving, we’re seeing a lot more users getting to success.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While usage today is dominated by consumers and small businesses, the company has begun testing an enterprise offering, and is running pilots with “a small number of customers” to better understand requirements around security, compliance and governance, Jha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. and Europe account for roughly 70% of Emergent’s overall revenue, though India is the startup’s next-largest and fastest-growing market, supported by local pricing that has driven adoption among small businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emergent on Tuesday also launched a mobile app for iOS and Android that lets users create apps and publish them directly to Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. The app is currently in testing, though its users have already built more than 10,000 applications, the startup said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app lets users type in text prompts or converse with AI using voice to build apps, websites, or platforms. The startup noted that users can also switch between the mobile app and the desktop version without losing context or progress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jha said the mobile launch reflects the platform’s asynchronous, agent-based workflow, where users delegate tasks to AI and return later to review progress. With a growing share of users already accessing the platform via mobile browsers and a large proportion of apps being built for mobile use, he said extending those workflows to a native app was a natural next step.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco-headquartered startup, with an office in Bengaluru, drew attention in January after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/indian-vibe-coding-startup-emergent-raises-70m-at-300m-valuation-from-softbank-khosla-ventures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raising $70 million in a funding round</a> jointly led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Khosla Ventures, less than four months after closing a $23 million Series A. The financing tripled Emergent’s valuation to $300 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It expects the plan to catalyze an additional $150 billion in related investments and result in a $250 billion AI infrastructure ecosystem in India over the decade.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adani is making this commitment against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/the-ai-infrastructure-boom-shows-no-sign-of-slowing-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">skyrocketing investments in AI infrastructure</a> as companies increasingly look beyond the U.S. for computing power, energy and friendly regulation.

The conglomerate is developing large-scale AI data-center campuses in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visakhapatnam</a> and Noida, and has plans for more facilities in Hyderabad and Pune. An expanded partnership with Walmart-owned Flipkart will focus on another AI data center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adani said the broader plan calls for deploying up to 5 gigawatts of data-center capacity. The company said the facilities will be developed as a unified system that would scale power generation and processing capacity in parallel.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The effort builds on AdaniConneX, a joint venture between Adani Enterprises and U.S.-based EdgeConneX, a developer and operator of data centers for hyperscale and enterprise customers. The JV, Adani said, has already developed about 2 gigawatts of data-center capacity across India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Central to the strategy is Adani’s renewable-energy portfolio, which the group said will supply carbon-neutral power to the data centers. The company pointed to its 30-gigawatt Khavda renewable project in western India — more than 10 gigawatts of which is already operational — and said it plans to invest an additional $55 billion to expand renewable generation and battery energy storage over the coming years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To reduce exposure to global supply-chain disruptions, Adani said it plans to co-invest in domestic manufacturing of critical components, such as transformers, power electronics and thermal management systems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adani did not respond to questions about how much of the $100 billion investment is already committed capital, how the spending will be phased over the coming years, and when the first large-scale AI workloads are expected to become operational.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Airbnb said that properties with a “flexible” or “moderate” cancellation policy are eligible for the upfront reservation. With this option, users get charged closer to their check-in date rather than at the time of booking. The feature mirrors “buy now, pay later” payment plans that have become popular in e-commerce, making expensive travel more accessible by spreading out costs. The company noted that since the launch, the feature saw 70% adoption for eligible bookings.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?w=351\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036917\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg 978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=77,150 77w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=155,300 155w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=768,1489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=351,680 351w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=619,1200 619w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=660,1280 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=222,430 222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=371,720 371w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=464,900 464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=413,800 413w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=792,1536 792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=345,668 345w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=193,375 193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=318,617 318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=274,531 274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Airbnb</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Airbnb</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During its earnings calls for Q4 2025, Airbnb said that the feature helped grow nights booked in the quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Reserve Now, Pay Later saw significant adoption among eligible guests in Q4. It’s also led to longer booking lead times and a mix shift towards larger entire homes, especially those with four or more bedrooms, contributing to the increase in average daily rate,” Ellie Mertz, CFO of Airbnb, said during the call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mertz noted that Airbnb’s overall cancellation rate jumped from 16% to 17% for the quarter, and it was higher among customers who use the upfront booking product. However, she said that this was “not hugely material relative to the broader cancellations on the platform.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, the company surveyed U.S. travelers along with Focaldata, a London-based market research and polling company. Of those surveyed, 60% of participants said that a flexible payment option is important while booking a holiday, and 55% said that would use a flexible payment option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been experimenting with pay-later products for years now.

The companies claim these agents will be able to autonomously handle complex enterprise workflows across industries such as banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. The tie-up was announced at India’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi this week, which will see top executives from AI companies and Big Tech alike in attendance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal comes amid fears that AI tools, especially those built by major AI labs like Anthropic and OpenAI, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-file-it-giants-face-heat-ai-disruption-2026-02-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">will disrupt India’s heavily-staffed, $280 billion IT services industry</a>, raising questions about the future of labor-intensive outsourcing business models. Earlier this month, shares of Indian IT companies went into <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-tech-stocks-slump-anthropics-ai-tool-raises-global-staffing-concerns-2026-02-04/\">freefall</a> after Anthropic launched a suite of enterprise AI tools that claimed to automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and research roles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership would give Infosys, one of the world’s largest IT services businesses, access to Anthropic’s Claude models and developer tools for building AI agents tailored for large enterprises. Infosys said it would use Anthropic’s Claude Code to help write, test and debug code, and said it is already deploying the tool internally to build expertise that will be applied to client work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Infosys also detailed how AI is contributing to its business: AI-related services generated revenue of ₹25 billion (around $275 million), or 5.5% of the company’s total revenue of ₹454.8 billion (about $5 billion) in the December quarter. Rival Tata Consultancy Services previously said its AI services generate about $1.8 billion annually, or around 6% of revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Anthropic, the partnership offers a route into heavily regulated enterprise sectors where deploying AI systems at scale requires industry expertise and governance capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a big gap between an AI model that works in a demo and one that works in a regulated industry,” said Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei. Infosys’ experience in sectors such as financial services, telecoms, and manufacturing helps bridge that gap, he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic this week also opened its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first India office in Bengaluru</a>, as it seeks to expand further into the country, which has grown into the company’s second-largest market. Anthropic said India now <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/india-brief-economic-index\">accounts</a> for about 6% of global Claude usage, second only to the U.S., and much of that activity is concentrated in programming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Infosys did not disclose the timeline for deploying Claude-powered AI agents or the financial terms of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership is similar to other moves by Indian IT services firms. <a href=\"https://www.hcltech.com/press-releases/hcltech-and-openai-collaborate-drive-enterprise-scale-ai-adoption\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">HCLTech and OpenAI</a> last year partnered up to help enterprises deploy AI tools at scale. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The models, dubbed Tiny Aya, are open-weight — meaning their underlying code is publicly available for anyone to use and modify — support over 70 languages, and can run on everyday devices like laptops without requiring an internet connection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model, launched by the company’s research arm Cohere Labs, supports South Asian languages such as Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The base model contains 3.35 billion parameters — a measure of its size and complexity. Cohere has also launched TinyAya-Global, a version fine-tuned to better follow user commands, for apps that require broad language support. Regional variants round out the family: TinyAya-Earth for African languages; TinyAya-Fire for South Asian languages; and TinyAya-Water for Asia Pacific, West Asia, and Europe.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.32.50-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093365\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.32.50-AM.jpg 625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.32.50-AM.jpg?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.32.50-AM.jpg?resize=300,260 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.32.50-AM.jpg?resize=430,372 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.32.50-AM.jpg?resize=433,375 433w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.32.50-AM.jpg?resize=613,531 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.32.50-AM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Cohere</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This approach allows each model to develop stronger linguistic grounding and cultural nuance, creating systems that feel more natural and reliable for the communities they are meant to serve. At the same time, all Tiny Aya models retain broad multilingual coverage, making them flexible starting points for further adaptation and research,” the company said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cohere noted that these models, which were trained on a single cluster of 64 H100 GPUs (a type of high-powered chip by Nvidia) using relatively modest computing sources, are ideal for researchers and developers building apps for audiences that speak native languages. The models are capable of running directly on devices, so developers can use them to power offline translation. The company noted that it built its underlying software to suit on-device usage, requiring less computing power than most comparable models.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.45.42-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093364\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.45.42-AM.jpg 628w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.45.42-AM.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.45.42-AM.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.45.42-AM.jpg?resize=430,359 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.45.42-AM.jpg?resize=449,375 449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-17-at-9.45.42-AM.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Cohere</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In linguistically diverse countries like India, this kind of offline-friendly capability can open up a diverse set of applications and use cases without the need for constant internet access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models are available on HuggingFace, the popular platform for sharing and testing AI models, and the Cohere Platform.

While his visits included stops at companies like Lovable — where he <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/GEVS94/status/2021655692315329021\">posted</a> from its office — the trips were also about finding future Swedish unicorns before they cross the Atlantic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This all came to light when <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/andreessen-horowitz-invests-early-in-swedish-ai-startup-dentio\">news emerged</a> that a16z had led a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dentio.io/blog/preseed\">$2.3 million pre-seed round</a> into <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dentio.io/\">Dentio</a>, a Swedish startup that uses AI to help dentists’ practices with admin work. While this is a small check for a firm that just announced new funds totaling <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/the-venture-firm-that-ate-silicon-valley/\">$15 billion</a>, it confirms that U.S. VCs are actively seeking deal flow outside of the U.S., even without local offices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stockholm is a natural stop for a16z, which previously achieved significant returns from backing Skype, cofounded by Swedish entrepreneur Niklas Zennström. Since then, a significant number of fast-growing startups have been created in the Swedish capital, and the VC heavyweight tracked down where many of them were coming from. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We spend a lot of time developing a deep understanding of specific markets and knowing where innovation is emerging. In Sweden, that has meant closely tracking ecosystems like [SSE Business Lab] — the startup incubator of the Stockholm School of Economics — and the companies coming out of it,” Vasquez told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like fintech giant Klarna, legal AI startup Legora, and e-scooter company Voi, Dentio is an alum of SSE Business Lab — a startup incubator that has produced several successful Swedish companies. The three former high school classmates Elias Afrasiabi, Anton Li and Lukas Sjögren joined the incubator after reconnecting as students at both the SSE (Stockholm School of Economics) and KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), then joined the incubator with additional backing from KTH’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kth-innovation_congratulations-team-dentio-on-securing-investment-activity-7421887366367248384-Gu4O?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\">Innovation Launch program</a>. They tackled a problem close to home: Li’s mom, a dentist, had told them how admin work detracted from clinical care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trio intuited that they could leverage LLMs to help people like her — an idea that they also validated with her and her colleagues. This led them to Dentio’s initial product, a recording tool that uses AI to generate clinical notes. But it’s only a matter of time before AI scribes become a commodity product, and Dentio needs to prove its value to dentists so they aren’t tempted to switch providers when that happens, Afrasiabi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Potential competitors include fellow Swedish startup Tandem Health, which raised a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tandemhealth.ai/news-articles/tandem-secures-50m-to-build-an-ai-native-operating-system-for-clinical-workflows-across-europe\">$50 million Series A</a> round last year to support clinicians with AI across multiple medical specialties. Dentio, by contrast, focuses exclusively on dentists, but it believes it can still reach the scale VCs expect through international expansion</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now we’re a team of seven people, and we think that it’s possible to build a unified way of handling administration all over Europe, and maybe even all over the world,” Afrasiabi said. While Europe’s healthcare systems are fragmented, they share similarities, and Dentio’s assumption is that what works in Sweden could work elsewhere in the EU.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dentio prominently features its “Made in Sweden” branding and emphasizes that “all relevant data is processed in Sweden and Finland in compliance with Swedish and EU law.” It signals data protection to privacy-conscious European customers. But it also signals potential to VCs — a callback to Sweden’s history of producing breakout companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We went to zero meetups. I reached out to zero investors,” Afrasiabi said. While the team was heads down building, the word spread out. “I think it was mostly through referrals and people talking to each other that the news got all the way over to the U.S.,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This wasn’t happenstance: a16z has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/a16z-has-venture-scouts-scattered-across-europe/\">eyes around the world</a> in order to spot these companies as early as local funds might, Vasquez said. “In Sweden for example, we partnered with top founders abroad like Fredrik Hjelm, founder of Voi, and Johannes Schildt, founder of Kry, by turning them into scouts and mapping the best local talent.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Vasquez, who focuses on AI application investments for a16z, this isn’t just about Sweden, but about “a pattern of great global companies being born abroad and scaling quickly,” from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/black-forest-labs-raises-300m-at-3-25b-valuation/\">Black Forest Labs</a> in Germany to Manus, the Singapore-based AI startup recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/\">acquired by Meta</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Born and raised in El Salvador, he has also been spending time in São Paulo. “I’m really excited about what’s brewing in Brazil and across Latin America in AI,” he <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gabriel-vasquez-49392580_last-week-i-got-to-spend-time-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-activity-7422308837480763393-Ks10/\">wrote</a> on LinkedIn at the time. “I believe AI is the great equalizer,” he added. “Most people now have access to PhD-level intelligence on a phone, and ultimately, Silicon Valley is a state of mind.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Corrections: This story originally stated that a16z is an investor in Lovable owing to an editing error.

(They didn’t take the offers.) The pair worked at Google Brain together and were early employees at Anthropic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They earned acclaim at Google by creating the Alpha Chip — an AI tool that could generate solid chip layouts in hours — a process that normally takes human designers a year or more. The tool helped design three generations of Google’s Tensor Processing Units.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That pedigree explains why, just four months after launching Ricursive, they last month announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/ai-chip-startup-ricursive-hits-4b-valuation-two-months-after-launch/\">$300 million Series A round</a> at a $4 billion valuation led by Lightspeed, just a couple of months after raising a $35 million seed round led by Sequoia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ricursive is building AI tools that design chips, not the chips themselves. That makes them fundamentally different from nearly every other AI chip startup: they’re not a wannabe Nvidia competitor. In fact, Nvidia is an investor. The GPU giant, along with AMD, Intel, and every other chip maker, are the startup’s target customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to enable any chip, like a custom chip or a more traditional chip, any kind of chip, to be built in an automated and very accelerated way. We’re using AI to do that,” Mirhoseini told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their paths first crossed at Stanford, where Goldie earned her PhD as Mirhoseini taught computer science classes. Since then, their careers have been in lockstep. “We started at Google Brain on the same day. We left Google Brain on the same day. We joined Anthropic on the same day. We left Anthropic on the same day. We rejoined Google on the same day, and then we left Google again on the same day. Then we started this company together on the same day,” Goldie recounted.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During their time at Google, the colleagues were so close they even worked out together, both enjoying circuit training. The pun wasn’t lost on Jeff Dean, the famed Google engineer who was their collaborator. He nicknamed their Alpha Chip project “chip circuit training” — a play on their shared workout routine. Internally, the pair also got a nickname: A&amp;A. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Alpha Chip earned them industry notice, but it also attracted controversy. In 2022, one of their colleagues at Google was fired, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-brain-ai-researcher-fired-tension/\">Wired reported</a>, after he spent years trying to discredit A&amp;A and their chip work, even though that work was used to help produce some of Google’s most important, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/google-unveils-ironwood-a-new-ai-accelerator-chip/\">bet-the-business AI chips</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their Alpha Chip project at Google Brain proved the concept that would become Ricursive — using AI to dramatically accelerate chip design.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-designing-chips-is-hard\">Designing chips is hard</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue is, computer chips have millions to billions of logic gate components integrated on their silicon wafer. Human designers can spend a year or more placing those components on the chip to ensure performance, good power utilization and any other design needs. Digitally determining the placement of such infinitesimally small components with precision is, as you might expect, hard. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alpha Chip “could generate a very high-quality layout in, like, six hours. And the cool thing about this approach was that it actually learns from experience,” Goldie said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The premise of their AI chip design work is to use “a reward signal” that rates how good the design is. The agent then takes that rating to “update the parameters of its deep neural network to get better,” Goldie said. After completing thousands of designs, the agent got really good. It also got faster as it learned, the founders say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ricursive’s platform will take the concept further. The AI chip designer they are building will “learn across different chips,” Goldie said. So each chip it designs should help it become a better designer for every next chip. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ricursive’s platform also makes use of LLMs and will handle everything from component placement through design verification. Any company that makes electronics and needs chips is their target customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If their platform proves itself, as it seems likely to do, Ricursive could play a role in the moonshot goal of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Indeed, their ultimate vision is designing AI chips, meaning the AI will essentially design its own computer brains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Chips are the fuel for AI,” Goldie said. “I think by building more powerful chips, that’s the best way to advance that frontier.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirhoseini adds that the lengthy chip-design process is constraining how quickly AI can advance. “We think we can also enable this fast co-evolution of the models and the chips that basically power them,” she said. So AI can grow smarter faster. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the thought of AI designing its own brains at ever increasing speeds brings visions of Skynet and the Terminator to mind, the founders point out that there’s a more positive, immediate and, they think, more likely benefit: hardware efficiency.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When AI Labs can design far more efficient chips (and, eventually all the underlying hardware), their growth won’t have to consume so much <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/why-the-economics-of-orbital-ai-are-so-brutal/\">of the world’s resources.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We could design a computer architecture that’s uniquely suited to that model, and we could achieve almost a 10x improvement in performance per total cost of ownership,” Goldie said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the young startup won’t name its early customers, the founders say that they’ve heard from every big chip making name you can imagine. Unsurprisingly, they have their pick of their first development partners, too. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Propelled by its young and curious founders, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://flappingairplanes.com/\">Flapping Airplanes</a> is focused on finding less data-hungry ways to train AI. It’s a potential game-changer for the economics and capabilities of AI models — and with $180 million in seed funding, they’ll have plenty of runway to figure it out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, I spoke with the lab’s three co-founders — brothers Ben and Asher Spector, and Aidan Smith — about why this is an exciting moment to start a new AI lab and why they keep coming back to ideas about the human brain.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>I want to start by asking, why now? Labs like OpenAI and DeepMind have spent so much on scaling their models. I’m sure the competition seems daunting. Why did this feel like a good moment to launch a foundation model company?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong> There’s just so much to do. So, the advances that we’ve gotten over the last five to ten years have been spectacular. We love the tools. We use them every day. But the question is, is this the whole universe of things that needs to happen? And we thought about it very carefully and our answer was no, there’s a lot more to do. In our case, we thought that the data efficiency problem was sort of really the key thing to go look at. The current frontier models are trained on the sum totality of human knowledge, and humans can obviously make do with an awful lot less. So there’s a big gap there, and it’s worth understanding. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What we’re doing is really a concentrated bet on three things. It’s a bet that this data efficiency problem is the important thing to be doing. Like, this is really a direction that is new and different and you can make progress on it. It’s a bet that this will be very commercially valuable and that will make the world a better place if we can do it. And it’s also a bet that’s sort of the right kind of team to do it is a creative and even in some ways inexperienced team that can go look at these problems again from the ground up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. We don’t really see ourselves as competing with the other labs, because we think that we’re looking at just a very different set of problems. If you look at the human mind, it learns in an incredibly different way from transformers. And that’s not to say better, just very different. So we see these different trade offs. LLMs have an incredible ability to memorize, and draw on this great breadth of knowledge, but they can’t really pick up new skills very fast. It takes just rivers and rivers of data to adapt. And when you look inside the brain, you see that the algorithms that it uses are just fundamentally so different from gradient descent and some of the techniques that people use to train AI today. So that’s why we’re building a new guard of researchers to kind of address these problems and really think differently about the AI space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher</strong>: This question is just so scientifically interesting: why are the systems that we have built that are intelligent also so different from what humans do? Where does this difference come from? How can we use knowledge of that difference to make better systems? But at the same time, I also think it’s actually very commercially viable and very good for the world. Lots of regimes that are really important are also highly data constrained, like robotics or scientific discovery. Even in enterprise applications, a model that’s a million times more data efficient is probably a million times easier to put into the economy. So for us, it was very exciting to take a fresh perspective on these approaches, and think, if we really had a model that’s vastly more data efficient, what could we do with it?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>This gets into my next question, which is sort of ties in also to the name, Flapping Airplanes. There’s this philosophical question in AI about how much we’re trying to recreate what humans do in their brain, versus creating some more abstract intelligence that takes a completely different path. Aidan is coming from Neuralink, which is all about the human brain. Do you see yourself as kind of pursuing a more neuromorphic view of AI? </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan: </strong>The way I look at the brain is as an existence proof. We see it as evidence that there are other algorithms out there. There’s not just one orthodoxy. And the brain has some crazy constraints. When you look at the underlying hardware, there’s some crazy stuff. It takes a millisecond to fire an action potential. In that time, your computer can do just so so many operations. And so realistically, there’s probably an approach that’s actually much better than the brain out there, and also very different than the transformer. So we’re very inspired by some of the things that the brain does, but we don’t see ourselves being tied down by it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>Just to add on to that. it’s very much in our name: Flapping Airplanes. Think of the current systems as big, Boeing 787s. We’re not trying to build birds. That’s a step too far. We’re trying to build some kind of a flapping airplane. My perspective from computer systems is that the constraints of the brain and silicon are sufficiently different from each other that we should not expect these systems to end up looking the same. When the substrate is so different and you have genuinely very different trade-offs about the cost of compute, the cost of locality and moving data, you actually expect these systems to look a little bit different. But just because they will look somewhat different does not mean that we should not take inspiration from the brain and try to use the parts that we think are interesting to improve our own systems. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>It does feel like there’s now more freedom for labs to focus on research, as opposed to, just developing products. It feels like a big difference for this generation of labs. You have some that are very research focused, and others that are sort of “research focused for now.” What does that conversation look like within flapping airplanes?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher:</strong> I wish I could give you a timeline. I wish I could say, in three years, we’re going to have solved the research problem. This is how we’re going to commercialize. I can’t. We don’t know the answers. We’re looking for truth. That said, I do think we have commercial backgrounds. I spent a bunch of time developing technology for companies that made those companies a reasonable amount of money. Ben has incubated a bunch of startups that have commercial backgrounds, and we actually are excited to commercialize. We think it’s good for the world to take the value you’ve created and put it in the hands of people who can use it. So I don’t think we’re opposed to it. We just need to start by doing research, because if we start by signing big enterprise contracts, we’re going to get distracted, and we won’t do the research that’s valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan:</strong> Yeah, we want to try really, really radically different things, and sometimes radically even things are just worse than the paradigm. We’re exploring a set of different trade offs. It’s our hope that they will be different in the long run. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>Companies are at their best when they’re really focused on doing something well, right? Big companies can afford to do many, many different things at once. When you’re a startup, you really have to pick what is the most valuable thing you can do, and do that all the way. And we are creating the most value when we are all in on solving fundamental problems for the time being. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m actually optimistic that reasonably soon, we might have made enough progress that we can then go start to touch grass in the real world. And you learn a lot by getting feedback from the real world. The amazing thing about the world is, it teaches you things constantly, right? It’s this tremendous vat of truth that you get to look into whenever you want. I think the main thing that I think has been enabled by the recent change in the economics and financing of these structures is the ability to let companies really focus on what they’re good at for longer periods of time. I think that focus, the thing that I’m most excited about, that will let us do really differentiated work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>To spell out what I think you’re referring to: there’s so much excitement around and the opportunity for investors is so clear that they are willing to give $180 million in seed funding to a completely new company full of these very smart, but also very young people who didn’t just cash out of PayPal or anything. How was it engaging with that process? Did you know, going in, there is this appetite, or was it something you discovered, of like, actually, we can make this a bigger thing than we thought.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong> I would say it was a mixture of the two. The market has been hot for many months at this point. So it was not a secret that no large rounds were starting to come together. But you never quite know how the fundraising environment will respond to your particular ideas about the world. This is, again, a place where you have to let the world give you feedback about what you’re doing. Even over the course of our fundraise, we learned a lot and actually changed our ideas. And we refined our opinions of the things we should be prioritizing, and what the right timelines were for commercialization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think we were somewhat surprised by how well our message resonated, because it was something that was very clear to us, but you never know whether your ideas will turn out to be things that other people believe as well or if everyone else thinks you’re crazy. We have been extremely fortunate to have found a group of amazing investors who our message really resonated with and they said, “Yes, this is exactly what we’ve been looking for.” And that was amazing. It was, you know, surprising and wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan:</strong> Yeah, a thirst for the age of research has kind of been in the water for a little bit now. And more and more, we find ourselves positioned as the player to pursue the age of research and really try these radical ideas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>At least for the scale-driven companies, there is this enormous cost of entry for foundation models. Just building a model at that scale is an incredibly compute-intensive thing. Research is a little bit in the middle, where presumably you are building foundation models, but if you’re doing it with less data and you’re not so scale-oriented, maybe you get a bit of a break. How much do you expect compute costs to be sort of limiting your runway.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong> One of the advantages of doing deep, fundamental research is that, somewhat paradoxically, it is much cheaper to do really crazy, radical ideas than it is to do incremental work. Because when you do incremental work, in order to find out whether or not it does work, you have to go very far up the scaling ladder. Many interventions that look good at small scale do not actually persist at large scale. So as a result, it’s very expensive to do that kind of work. Whereas if you have some crazy new idea about some new architecture optimizer, it’s probably just gonna fail on the first rum, right? So you don’t have to run this up the ladder. It’s already broken. That’s great. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, this doesn’t mean that scale is irrelevant for us. Scale is actually an important tool in the toolbox of all the things that you can do. Being able to scale up our ideas is certainly relevant to our company. So I wouldn’t frame us as the antithesis of scale, but I think it is a wonderful aspect of the kind of work we’re doing, that we can try many of our ideas at very small scale before we would even need to think about doing them at large scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher: </strong>Yeah, you should be able to use all the internet. But you shouldn’t <em>need</em> to. We find it really, really perplexing that you need to use all the Internet to really get this human level intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>So, what becomes possible  if you’re able to train more efficiently on data, right? Presumably the model will be more powerful and intelligent. But do you have specific ideas about kind of where that goes? Are we looking at more out-of-distribution generalization, or are we looking at sort of models that get better at a particular task with less experience?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher: </strong>So, first, we’re doing science, so I don’t know the answer, but I can give you three hypotheses. So my first hypothesis is that there’s a broad spectrum between just looking for statistical patterns and something that has really deep understanding. And I think the current models live somewhere on that spectrum. I don’t think they’re all the way towards deep understanding, but they’re also clearly not just doing statistical pattern matching. And it’s possible that as you train models on less data, you really force the model to have incredibly deep understandings of everything it’s seen. And as you do that, the model may become more intelligent in very interesting ways. It may know less facts, but get better at reasoning. So that’s one potential hypothesis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another hypothesis is similar to what you said, that at the moment, it’s very expensive, both operationally and also in pure monetary costs, to teach models new capabilities, because you need so much data to teach them those things. It’s possible that one output of what we’re doing is to get vastly more efficient at post training, so with only a couple of examples, you could really put a model into a new domain. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then it’s also possible that this just unlocks new verticals for AI. There are certain types of robotics, for instance, where for whatever reason, we can’t quite get the type of capabilities that really makes it commercially viable. My opinion is that it’s a limited data problem, not a hardware problem. The fact that you can tele-operate the robots to do stuff is proof that that the hardware is sufficiently good. Butthere’s lots of domains like this, like scientific discovery. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>One thing I’ll also double-click on is that when we think about the impact that AI can have on the world, one view you might have is that this is a deflationary technology. That is, the role of AI is to automate a bunch of jobs, and take that work and make it cheaper to do, so that you’re able to remove work from the economy and have it done by robots instead. And I’m sure that will happen. But this is not, to my mind, the most exciting vision of AI. The most exciting vision of AI is one where there’s all kinds of new science and technologies that we can construct that humans aren’t smart enough to come up with, but other systems can. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On this aspect, I think that first axis that Ascher was talking about around the spectrum between sort of true generalization versus memorization or interpolation of the data, I think that axis is extremely important to have the deep insights that will lead to these new advances in medicine and science. It is important that the models are very much on the creativity side of the spectrum. And so, part of why I’m very excited about the work that we’re doing is that I think even beyond the individual economic impacts, I’m also just genuinely very kind of mission-oriented around the question of, can we actually get AI to do stuff that, like, fundamentally humans couldn’t do before? And that’s more than just, “Let’s go fire a bunch of people from their jobs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Absolutely. Does that put you in a particular camp on, like, the AGI conversation, the like out of distribution, generalization conversation.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher: </strong>I really don’t exactly know what AGI means. It’s clear that capabilities are advancing very quickly. It’s clear that there’s tremendous amounts of economic value that’s being created. I don’t think we’re very close to God-in-a-box, in my opinion. I don’t think that within two months or even two years, there’s going to be a singularity where suddenly humans are completely obsolete. I basically agree with what Ben said at the beginning, which is, it’s a really big world. There’s a lot of work to do. There’s a lot of amazing work being done, and we’re excited to contribute</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Well, the idea about the brain and the neuromorphic part of it does feel relevant. You’re saying, really the relevant thing to compare LLMs to is the human brain, more than the Mechanical Turk or the deterministic computers that came before.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan: </strong>I’ll emphasize, the brain is not the ceiling, right? The brain, in many ways, is the floor. Frankly, I see no evidence that the brain is not a knowable system that follows physical laws. In fact, we know it’s under many constraints. And so we would expect to be able to create capabilities that are much, much more interesting and different and potentially better than the brain in the long run. And so we’re excited to contribute to that future, whether that’s AGI or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher: </strong>And I do think the brain is the relevant comparison, just because the brain helps us understand how big the space is. Like, it’s easy to see all the progress we’ve made and think, wow, we like, have the answer. We’re almost done. But if you look outward a little bit and try to have a bit more perspective, there’s a lot of stuff we don’t know. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>We’re not trying to be better, per se. We’re trying to be different, right? That’s the key thing I really want to hammer on here. All of these systems will almost certainly have different trade offs of them. You’ll get an advantage somewhere, and it’ll cost you somewhere else. And it’s a big world out there. There are so many different domains that have so many different trade offs that having more system, and more fundamental technologies that can address these different domains is very likely to make the kind of AI diffuse more effectively and more rapidly through the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of the ways you’ve distinguished yourself, is in your hiring approach, getting people who are very, very young, in some cases, still in college or high school. What is it that clicks for you when you’re talking to someone and that makes you think, I want this person working with us on these research problems?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan: </strong>It’s when you talk to someone and they just dazzle you, they have so many new ideas and they think about things in a way that many established researchers just can’t because they haven’t been polluted by the context of thousands and thousands of papers. Really, the number one thing we look for is creativity. Our team is so exceptionally creative, and every day, I feel really lucky to get to go in and talk about really radical solutions to some of the big problems in AI with people and dream up a very different future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong>  Probably the number one signal that I’m personally looking for is just like, do they teach me something new when I spend time with them? If they teach me something new, the odds that they’re going to teach us something new about what we’re working on is also pretty good. When you’re doing research, those creative, new ideas are really the priority. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of my background was during my undergrad and PhD., I helped start this incubator called Prod that worked with a bunch of companies that turned out well. And I think one of the things that we saw from that was that young people can absolutely compete in the very highest echelons of industry. Frankly, a big part of the unlock is just realizing, yeah, I can go do this stuff. You can absolutely go contribute at the highest level. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, we do recognize the value of experience. People who have worked on large scale systems are great, like, we’ve hired some of them, you know, we are excited to work with all sorts of folks. And I think our mission has resonated with the experienced folks as well. I just think that our key thing is that we want people who are not afraid to change the paradigm and can try to imagine a new system of how things might work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of things I’ve been puzzling about is, how different do you think the resulting AI systems are going to be? It’s easy for me to imagine something like Claude Opus that just works 20% better and can do 20% more things. But if it’s just completely new, it’s hard to think about where that goes or what the end result looks like.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher:</strong> I don’t know if you’ve ever had the privilege of talking to the GPT-4 base model, but it had a lot of really strange emerging capabilities. For example, you could take a snippet of an unwritten blog post of yours, and ask, who do you think wrote this, and it could identify it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a lot of capabilities like this, where models are smart in ways we cannot fathom. And future models will be smarter in even stranger ways. I think we should expect the future to be really weird and the architectures to be even weirder. We’re looking for 1000x wins in data efficiency. We’re not trying to make incremental change. And so we should expect the same kind of unknowable, alien changes and capabilities at the limit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ben: I broadly agree with that. I’m probably slightly more tempered in how these things will eventually become experienced by the world, just as the GPT-4 base model was tempered by OpenAI. You want to put things in forms where you’re not staring into the abyss as a consumer. I think that’s important. But I broadly agree that our research agenda is about building capabilities that really are quite fundamentally different from what can be done right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Fantastic! Are there ways people can engage with flapping airplanes? Is it too early for that? Or they should just stay tuned for when the research and the models come out well.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher:</strong> So, we have Hi@flappingairplanes.com. If you just want to say hi, We also have disagree@flappingairplanes.com if you want to disagree with us. We’ve actually had some really cool conversations where people, like, send us very long essays about why they think it’s impossible to do what we’re doing. And we’re happy to engage with it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong> But they haven’t convinced us yet. No one has convinced us yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher:</strong> The second thing is, you know, we are, we are looking for exceptional people who are trying to change the field and change the world. So if you’re interested, you should reach out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>And if you have another unorthodox background, it’s okay. You don’t need two PhDs. We really are looking for folks who think differently.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These expressions of AI angst were likely written by humans, or at least prompted with human guidance, researchers have discovered. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Every credential that was in [Moltbook’s] <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/supabase-nabs-5b-valuation-four-months-after-hitting-2b/\">Supabase</a> was unsecured for some time,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-ahl-50876612/\">Ian Ahl</a>, CTO at Permiso Security, explained to TechCrunch. “For a little bit of time, you could grab any token you wanted and pretend to be another agent on there, because it was all public and available.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unusual on the internet to see a real person trying to appear as though they’re an AI agent — more often, bot accounts on social media are attempting to appear like real people. With Moltbook’s security vulnerabilities, it became impossible to determine the authenticity of any post on the network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anyone, even humans, could create an account, impersonating robots in an interesting way, and then even upvote posts without any guardrails or rate limits,” John Hammond, a senior principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Moltbook made for a fascinating moment in internet culture — people recreated a social internet for AI bots, including a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moltmatch.com/\">Tinder for agents</a> and 4claw, a riff on 4chan.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More broadly, this incident on Moltbook is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise. It is technology that seems novel and exciting, but ultimately, some AI experts think that its inherent cybersecurity flaws are rendering the technology unusable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openclaw-s-viral-moment\">OpenClaw’s viral moment</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenClaw is a project of Austrian vibe coder <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steipete.me/\">Peter Steinberger</a>, initially released as Clawdbot (naturally, Anthropic <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/clawdbot-changes-name-moltbot-anthropic-trademark-2026-1\">took issue</a> with that name).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The open-source AI agent amassed over 190,000 stars on Github, making it the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/EvanLi/Github-Ranking/blob/master/Top100/Top-100-stars.md\">21st most popular</a> code repository ever posted on the platform. AI agents are not novel, but OpenClaw made them easier to use and to communicate with customizable agents in natural language via WhatsApp, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and most other popular messaging apps. OpenClaw users can leverage whatever underlying AI model they have access to, whether that be via Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or something else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the end of the day, OpenClaw is still just a wrapper to ChatGPT, or Claude,  or whatever AI model you stick to it,” Hammond said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With OpenClaw, users can download “skills” from a marketplace called ClawHub, which can make it possible to automate most of what one could do on a computer, from managing an email inbox to trading stocks. The skill associated with Moltbook, for example, is what enabled AI agents to post, comment, and browse on the website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on what people are already doing, and most of that iterative improvement has to do with giving it more access,” Chris Symons, chief AI scientist at Lirio, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Artem Sorokin, an AI engineer and the founder of AI cybersecurity tool Cracken, also thinks OpenClaw isn’t necessarily breaking new scientific ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“From an AI research perspective, this is nothing novel,” he told TechCrunch. “These are components that already existed. The key thing is that it hit a new capability threshold by just organizing and combining these existing capabilities that already were thrown together in a way that enabled it to give you a very seamless way to get tasks done autonomously.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s this level of unprecedented access and productivity that made OpenClaw so viral. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It basically just facilitates interaction between computer programs in a way that is just so much more dynamic and flexible, and that’s what’s allowing all these things to become possible,” Symons said. “Instead of a person having to spend all the time to figure out how their program should plug into this program, they’re able to just ask their program to plug in this program, and that’s accelerating things at a fantastic rate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s no wonder that OpenClaw seems so enticing. Developers are snatching up Mac Minis to power extensive OpenClaw setups that might be able to accomplish far more than a human could on their own. And it makes OpenAI CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent/\">Sam Altman’s prediction</a> that AI agents will allow a solo entrepreneur to turn a startup into a unicorn, seem plausible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can’t think critically like humans can.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you think about human higher-level thinking, that’s one thing that maybe these models can’t really do,” Symons said. “They can simulate it, but they can’t actually do it. “</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-existential-threat-to-agentic-ai\">The existential threat to agentic AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI agent evangelists now must wrestle with the downside of this agentic future. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Can you sacrifice some cybersecurity for your benefit, if it actually works and it actually brings you a lot of value?” Sorokin asks. “And where exactly can you sacrifice it — your day-to-day job, your work?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahl’s security tests of OpenClaw and Moltbook help illustrate Sorokin’s point. Ahl created an AI agent of his own named Rufio and quickly discovered it was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This occurs when bad actors get an AI agent to respond to something — perhaps a post on Moltbook, or a line in an email — that tricks it into doing something it shouldn’t do, like giving out account credentials or credit card information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I knew one of the reasons I wanted to put an agent on here is because I knew if you get a social network for agents, somebody is going to try to do mass prompt injection, and it wasn’t long before I started seeing that,” Ahl said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As he scrolled through Moltbook, Ahl wasn’t surprised to encounter several posts seeking to get an AI agent to send Bitcoin to a specific crypto wallet address.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not hard to see how AI agents on a corporate network, for example, might be vulnerable to targeted prompt injections from people trying to harm the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is just an agent sitting with a bunch of credentials on a box connected to everything — your email, your messaging platform, everything you use,” Ahl said. “So what that means is, when you get an email, and maybe somebody is able to put a little prompt injection technique in there to take an action, that agent sitting on your box with access to everything you’ve given it to can now take that action.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI agents are designed with guardrails protecting against prompt injections, but it’s impossible to assure that an AI won’t act out of turn — it’s like how a human might be knowledgable about the risk of phishing attacks, yet still click on a dangerous link in a suspicious email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve heard some people use the term, hysterically, ‘prompt begging,’ where you try to add in the guardrails in natural language to say, ‘Okay robot agent, please don’t respond to anything external, please don’t believe any untrusted data or input,’” Hammond said. “But even that is loosey goosey.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the industry is stuck: for agentic AI to unlock the productivity that tech evangelists think is possible, it can’t be so vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Speaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don’t use it right now,” Hammond said.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That shift has prompted Peak XV Partners to back <a href=\"https://c2isemi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">C2i Semiconductors</a>, an Indian startup building plug-and-play, system-level power solutions designed to cut energy losses and improve the economics of large-scale AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">C2i (which stands for control conversion and intelligence) has raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Peak XV Partners, with participation from Yali Deeptech and TDK Ventures, bringing the two-year-old startup’s total funding to $19 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investment comes as data-center energy demand accelerates worldwide. Electricity consumption from data centers is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">projected to nearly triple by 2035</a>, per a December 2025 report from BloombergNEF, while Goldman Sachs Research estimates data-center power demand <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-research/data-center-power-demand-the-6-ps-driving-growth-and-constraints\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">could surge 175% by 2030</a> from 2023 levels — the equivalent of adding another top-10 power-consuming country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of that strain comes not from generating electricity but from converting it efficiently inside data centers, where high-voltage power must be stepped down thousands of times before it reaches GPUs. This process currently wastes about 15% to 20% of energy, C2i’s co-founder and CTO Preetam Tadeparthy said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What used to be 400 volts has already moved to 800 volts, and will likely go higher,” Tadeparthy told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2024 by former Texas Instruments power executives Ram Anant, Vikram Gakhar, Preetam Tadeparthy, and Dattatreya Suryanarayana, along with Harsha S.

Rajan Anandan, the venture firm’s managing director, told TechCrunch that after the upfront capital investment in servers and facilities, energy costs become the dominant ongoing expense for data centers, making even incremental efficiency gains highly valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you can reduce energy costs by, call it, 10 to 30%, that’s like a huge number,” Anandan said. “You’re talking about tens of billions of dollars.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The claims will be tested quickly. C2i expects its first two silicon designs to return from fabrication between April and June, after which the startup plans to validate performance with data-center operators and hyperscalers that have asked to review the data, according to Tadeparthy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based startup has built a team of about 65 engineers and is setting up customer-facing operations in the U.S. and Taiwan as it prepares for early deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Power delivery is one of the most entrenched parts of the data-center stack, long dominated by large incumbents with deep balance sheets and years-long qualification cycles. While many newer companies focus on improving individual components, redesigning power delivery end-to-end requires coordinating silicon, packaging, and system architecture simultaneously — a capital-intensive approach that few startups attempt and one that can take years to prove in production environments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anandan said the real question now is execution, noting that all startups face technology, market, and team risks when betting on how industries evolve. In C2i’s case, he said, the feedback loop should be relatively short. “We’ll know in the next six months,” said Anandan, pointing to upcoming silicon and early customer validation as the moment when the thesis will be tested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bet also reflects how India’s semiconductor design ecosystem has matured in recent years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way you should look at semiconductors in India is, this is like 2008 e-commerce,” said Anandan. “It’s just getting started.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He pointed to the depth of engineering talent — with a growing share of global chip designers based in the country — alongside government-backed design-linked incentives that have lowered the cost and risk of tape-outs, making it increasingly viable for startups to build globally competitive semiconductor products from India rather than operate only as captive design centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether those conditions translate into a globally competitive product will become clearer over the coming months, as C2i begins validating its system-level power solutions with customers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

(The name changed the first time after Anthropic threatened legal action over its similarity to Claude, then changed again because Steinberger liked the new name better.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw\">a blog post announcing his decision</a> to join OpenAI, the Austrian developer said that while he might have been able to turn OpenClaw into a huge company, “It’s not really exciting for me.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What I want is to change the world, not build a large company[,] and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone,” Steinberger said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI CEO <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2023150230905159801?s=46&amp;t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw\">Sam Altman posted on X</a> that in his new role, Steinberger will “drive the next generation of personal agents.” As for OpenClaw, Altman said it will “live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support”</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
