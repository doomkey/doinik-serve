The company is now working on an image and video model codenamed “Mango” along with a new text-based model internally known as “Avocado,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-developing-new-ai-image-and-video-model-code-named-mango-16e785c7?mod=hp_listc_pos2\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant plans to release the new models in the first half of 2026, the publication said, citing an internal Q&amp;A at Meta on Thursday, where Wang and chief product officer Chris Cox unveiled the new roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wang had said Meta aims to make the text-based model better at coding while also exploring new world models that understand visual information and can reason, plan, and act without needing to be trained on every possibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has more recently fallen behind its rivals, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, in the AI race. The company’s AI division saw <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-plans-fourth-restructuring-ai-efforts-six-months\">significant</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai.html\">restructurings</a> this year, which included <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/meta-restructures-its-ai-unit-under-superintelligence-labs/\">leadership</a> changes and the poaching of researchers from other top companies. However, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/michaelsayman/status/1998492683837620307\">several</a> of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/vitaliychiley/status/1998404366202736841\">researchers</a> who joined Meta SuperIntelligence Labs (MSL) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-leave-meta-superintelligence-labs-openai/\">have already left the company</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, the company’s chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_as-many-of-you-have-heard-through-rumors-activity-7397020300451749888-2lhA/\">also announced that he’s leaving</a> to create his own startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/\">doesn’t have a winning AI product as of yet</a>. Instead, Meta AI assistant’s numbers are buoyed by the company’s existing social networks spanning billions of users, since the company places the assistant in the search bar of its apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means the first projects and models coming out of MSL will have a lot riding on them. </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Naver’s capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton’s $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Krafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content and fintech spaces.

The company also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/03/krafton-india-gaming-incubator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched a gaming incubator</a> in India in 2023, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/krafton-acquires-controlling-stake-in-indian-gaming-studio-nautilus-mobile-for-14m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired a controlling stake</a> in Indian gaming studio Nautilus Mobile for $14 million earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Krafton’s expansion in India has not been without setbacks. New Delhi <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/29/google-bgmi-pubg-india-play-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">banned BGMI</a>, the company’s flagship local title, in 2022, before allowing it to return in 2023 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/krafton-to-relaunch-bgmi-mobile-game-in-india-a-year-after-ban/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">following a three-month trial approval</a>.

This year, the data breaches were like nothing we’ve seen before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s our look back at some of the biggest security incidents of 2025, starting with:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. government remained one of the biggest targets in cyberspace. The year started with a brazen cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the U.S. Treasury, followed by the breaching of several federal agencies, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/hundreds-of-organizations-breached-by-sharepoint-mass-hacks/\">agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. nuclear weapons</a>, thanks to a SharePoint security flaw. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All the while, the Russian hackers were stealing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/russian-government-hackers-said-to-be-behind-us-federal-court-filing-system-hack-report/\">sealed records from the U.S. Courts’ filing system</a>, sending alarm bells ringing across the federal judiciary.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But nothing quite came as close as DOGE ripping through federal government departments and databases in what became the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/doge-biggest-breach-of-united-states-government-data-under-way/\">biggest raid of U.S. government data in its history</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Tesla CEO Elon Musk, with a visible black eye, listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025\" class=\"wp-image-3077706\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg 1995w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 30: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, with a visible black eye, listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025 in Washington, DC.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE as it was widely known, led by Elon Musk and his band of private sector lackeys, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/doge-staffer-violated-treasury-rules-by-emailing-unencrypted-personal-data/\">violated federal protocols</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/doge-staffer-with-access-to-americans-personal-data-leaked-private-xai-api-key/\">defied common security practices</a>. They <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/doge-uploaded-live-copy-of-social-security-database-to-vulnerable-cloud-server-says-whistleblower/\">ransacked federal databases of citizens’ data</a>, despite warnings of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/01/senator-warns-of-national-security-risks-after-elon-musks-doge-granted-full-access-to-sensitive-treasury-systems/\">the national security risks</a> and conflicts of interests over Musk’s overseas business dealings. Legal experts say that DOGE staffers are “personally liable” under U.S. hacking laws, though a court would also have to agree.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s subsequent, very public falling out with President Trump saw the billionaire leave DOGE, and left staffers fearing that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/doge-days-are-over-as-trump-disbands-elon-musks-team-of-federal-cost-cutters/\">they could face federal charges</a> without his protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In late September, senior executives at American corporate giants <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/dozens-of-organizations-had-data-stolen-in-oracle-linked-hacks/\">began receiving threatening emails</a> from a prolific ransomware and extortion group called Clop. The emails included an attached copy of their personal information — and a ransom demand for several million dollars not to publish it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Months earlier, the Clop gang had quietly exploited a never-before-seen vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business software, a suite of applications used for hosting a company’s core business information, such as financial and human resources records, supply chain data, and customer databases. The vulnerability allowed Clop to steal reams of sensitive employee data, including data belonging to executives, from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/dozens-of-organizations-had-data-stolen-in-oracle-linked-hacks/\">dozens of organizations</a> that rely on Oracle’s software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oracle had no idea until it was caught out in October as it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/clop-hackers-caught-exploiting-oracle-zero-day-bug-to-steal-executives-personal-data/\">scrambling to patch the vulnerability</a>. It was too late, though: the hackers had already stolen gobs of data from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/university-pennsylvania-oracle-e-business-suite-clop-attacks/\">universities</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/news/cl0p-cyberattack-update-18178/\">hospitals and health systems</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/washington-post-oracle-clop-attacks/\">media organizations</a>, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was Clop’s most recent mass-hacking campaign. The group had previously exploited flaws in enterprise file-transfer services, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/fortra-goanywhere-clop-ransomware/\">GoAnywhere</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/microsoft-clop-moveit-hacks-victims/\">MOVEit</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/24/clop-ransomware-gang-takes-credit-for-latest-mass-hack-that-breached-dozens-of-companies/\">Cleo Software</a>, which tech giants use to share large amounts of information over the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce customers had a rough year after two separate data breaches at downstream tech companies allowed hackers to steal a billion records of customer data stored in Salesforce’s cloud. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers targeted at least two companies, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/salesloft-says-drift-customer-data-thefts-linked-to-march-github-account-hack/\">Salesloft</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/google-says-hackers-stole-data-from-200-companies-following-gainsight-breach/\">Gainsight</a>, both of which allow their customers to handle and analyze the data that they store in Salesforce. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By breaching these companies directly, the hackers gained access to all of the data through their customer connections to Salesforce. Some of the largest tech giants had data stolen in the breaches, including Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Docusign, GitLab, Linkedin, SonicWall and Verizon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, made up of members from different hacking groups, including ShinyHunters, published a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/hacking-group-claims-theft-of-1-billion-records-from-salesforce-customer-databases/\">data leak site advertising the stolen records</a> in exchange for a ransom paid by the victims. New victims are still rolling in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers tore through the U.K. retail sector earlier this year, stealing data from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/marks-spencer-confirms-customers-personal-data-was-stolen-in-hack/\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> and at least <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/uk-retail-giant-co-op-confirms-hackers-stole-all-6-5-million-customer-records/\">6.5 million customer records from the Co-op</a>.

The U.K. government ended up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/uk-government-bails-out-jaguar-land-rover-with-1-5b-loan-after-hack-disrupts-vehicle-production-for-weeks/\">guaranteeing a bailout to the tune of £1.5 billion</a> to ensure Jaguar Land Rover employees and suppliers got paid during the shutdown. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.K. security experts said the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9pdld4y81o\">breach was the most economically damaging cyberattack</a> to hit the United Kingdom in history, showing that disruption may be more valuable for financially motivated hackers than stolen data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea experienced a major data breach every month this year, and the personal data of millions of its citizens was compromised thanks to security lapses and shoddy data practices at the country’s biggest tech and phone providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The country’s largest phone company, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/a-timeline-of-south-korean-telco-giant-skts-data-breach/\">SK Telecom, was hacked and 23 million customer records</a> were exposed; several cyberattacks were attributed to its hostile North Korean neighbor; and a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.govtech.com/question-of-the-day/how-much-government-data-was-lost-in-a-data-center-fire-in-south-korea\">massive data center fire</a> wiped out years of Korean government data that wasn’t backed up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the cherry on data breach cake was the months-long theft of some 33 million customers’ personal information from Coupang, the country’s retail giant that some call Asia’s Amazon. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/koreas-coupang-says-data-breach-exposed-nearly-34m-customers-personal-information/\">data theft began in June</a>, but wasn’t detected until November, and ultimately led to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/ceo-of-south-korean-retail-giant-coupang-resigns-after-massive-data-breach/\">company’s chief executive</a> resigning.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">originally reported by Axios</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/trump-signs-executive-order-approving-tiktok-deal/\">an executive order</a> signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/oracle-silver-lake-mgx-tiktok.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported</a> that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/september-19?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">except to say that</a> it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok’s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">national security concerns</a> as the rationale.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/apple-opens-up-its-app-store-to-competition-in-japan/\">Japan</a>, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/apple-loses-appeals-court-ruling-in-app-store-fight-with-epic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">federal appeals court earlier this month</a> ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new developer agreement</a>, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will <a href=\"https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/apple-eu-dma-update-june-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">transition from the CTF to a new fee</a>, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=76371du6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introducing</a> sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s “free delivery” claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/12/instacart-pay-60-million-consumer-refunds-settle-ftc-lawsuit-over-allegations-it-engaged-deceptive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a statement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instacart acknowledged the settlement in a <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/how-instacart-goes-above-and-beyond-for-customers-simplicity-transparency-and-billions-in-savings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The settlement comes as Instacart is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/study-shows-instacart-may-be-charging-some-shoppers-20-more-for-the-same-product/\">currently under fire</a> over a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/money/questionable-business-practices/instacart-ai-pricing-experiment-inflating-grocery-bills-a1142182490/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent study</a> that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores.

Shortly thereafter, the crypto exchange Coinbase separately appointed Osborne to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/coinbase-appoints-uk-ex-finance-minister-george-osborne-run-advisory-council-2025-12-18/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lead its internal advisory council</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcements drew particular attention in the U.K., where commenters noted that Osborne joins a <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/openai_george_osborne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growing list</a> of former British politicians now working for major U.S. tech companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’re not familiar with him or this trend, here’s what you need to know.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-osborne-s-career-looked-like\">What has Osborne’s career looked like?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A former conservative Member of Parliament, George Osborne served as chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016 — a role equivalent to that of a finance minister or treasury secretary in other countries, and currently held by Rachel Reeves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Prime Minister David Cameron resigned following the 2016 Brexit vote, Osborne eventually left public office in 2017. Alongside multiple other engagements, including a part-time advisory role for the investment firm BlackRock, he served as editor of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Standard_(London_newspaper)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Evening Standard</a> from 2017 to 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During that period, he also co-founded a VC firm, <a href=\"https://www.9yardscapital.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">9yards Capital</a>, with his brother Theo and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1af594c-fef5-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Theo’s brother-in-law David Fisher</a> as co-founders and managing partners. Several companies in 9yards’ portfolio have gone public since then — including Robinhood, Toast, and Coinbase. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-his-new-role-at-openai\">What’s his new role at OpenAI?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Osborne <a href=\"https://x.com/George_Osborne/status/2000982429247365479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on X that he was joining OpenAI “as managing director and head of OpenAI for [C]ountries, based here in London.” He will help expand existing partnerships and build new ones, OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-lehane-2562535_ive-spent-enough-time-in-government-to-know-activity-7406755715211628546-NpvR/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Introduced in May 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/openai-wants-to-team-up-with-governments-to-grow-ai-infrastructure/\">OpenAI for Countries</a> is an initiative through which the AI company partners with governments looking to build in-country data center capacity and localize ChatGPT for their language and culture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI for Countries is an extension of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">Stargate project</a>, a $500 billion initiative through which OpenAI is currently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">building five new data centers</a> across the U.S. with Oracle and SoftBank. But beyond infrastructure, its stated goal is to “support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/ten-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turns 10</a>, it is only natural that it starts hiring the kind of talent that won’t get <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/y-combinator-sam-altman-kicked-out-of-the-ritz-for-violating-dress-code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turned down at the Ritz for wearing sport shoes</a>. An Oxford graduate and the son of a baronet, Osborne fits the bill — but his network and reach are even more valuable, and his podcast with former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls, called “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@polcurrency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Political Currency</a>,” underscores his extensive political connections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His track record and contacts could be even more directly relevant for Coinbase, which he was already advising and where he will now “play a much more active role in helping us with policymakers around the world,” the company’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/coinbase-appoints-uk-ex-finance-minister-george-osborne-run-advisory-council-2025-12-18/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staying on the right side of regulators is particularly important for crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which has been making efforts to influence governments in the U.S. and beyond. But this is also critical for OpenAI, which intends to weigh in as AI gains a foothold in governments’ agendas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Lehane’s LinkedIn post, Osborne’s decision to take the role “reflects a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure — and early decisions about how it’s built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pattern-to-watch\">The pattern to watch</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Osborne’s latest role immediately drew parallels with other high-profile British politicians who went on to join major U.S. tech companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These include former U.K. deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who served as Meta’s policy chief <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/02/meta-policy-chief-nick-clegg-steps-down/\">for over six years</a>, and, more recently, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak taking on advisory roles <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqe22pz81o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with Microsoft and AI firm Anthropic</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This trend raises different concerns depending on your perspective. Some critics worry about active Members of Parliament like Sunak potentially advocating for U.S. corporate interests while still serving in government. Others take issue with former officials like Osborne leveraging their government experience and connections to secure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/15/george-osborne-investment-management-lingotto-agnelli-exor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">highly lucrative</a> private sector positions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “revolving door” phenomenon between government and the private sector <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">isn’t new</a>. But the practice has attracted heightened scrutiny in Europe, especially when controversial foreign companies — whether tech firms or retailers<a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2025/06/11/macron-defends-former-minister-now-lobbying-for-shein_6742246_5.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> like Shein</a> — hire former <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/11/05/shein-why-french-authorities-struggle-to-regulate-fast-fashion-giant_6747133_7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">government officials</a> to help navigate regulations and influence policy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seen from the other side, this is simply a matter of leveraging skills and experience. In his bio on 9yards’ team page, the VC firm touts that “George devised many regulations that positioned the U.K. as a global fintech leader, including the open banking regime and the FCA ‘sandbox.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others, however, view Osborne’s career moves more critically. They point to his controversial austerity policies as chancellor, and note that he has a history of ethics concerns around the revolving door. For example, when he took the Evening Standard editor job in 2017, he failed to seek approval from the government’s ethics watchdog first — a move that led to the body being criticized as “toothless.” His attitude at the time was telling: “At the age of 45, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor,” Osborne declared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, that mindset — transitioning quickly from public service to high-paying private roles — is precisely what makes his OpenAI and Coinbase appointments part of a broader pattern that concerns ethics watchdogs today.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

India is emerging as the fastest-growing market for profile verification, highlighting the country’s expanding influence on how digital work networks operate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn members are adding around 30 million verifications to their profiles each year, with adoption up more than 38% year-over-year in 2025, according to Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn’s vice president of trust products. The increase follows the company’s announcement last week that <a href=\"https://news.linkedin.com/2025/verified--linkedin-crosses-100m-member-milestone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 100 million users</a> have added at least one verification.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-linkedin-profile-features-help-verify-identity-detect-rodriguez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">began rolling out</a> profile verification to provide clearer signals of authenticity on the platform. It initially focused on confirming members’ workplace or identity, including through company email addresses, before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/linkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expanding to government-issued ID checks</a>, and has since been extended to company pages and job listings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most LinkedIn members who have added a verification to their profile have done so by confirming their association with a workplace, typically using a company email address or similar credentials, rather than verifying their personal identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">About 60% of verified members have confirmed a workplace affiliation, typically using a company email address, while roughly 27% have verified their identity using a government-issued ID, Rodriguez said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pace-of-india-growth\">The pace of India growth</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geographically, the U.S. accounts for the largest share of verified users, representing about 40% of the more than 100 million members who have added at least one verification, the company said. India follows closely, alongside other major markets, including the U.K., Canada, Brazil, and France.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the U.S. continues to account for the largest overall share of verified users, India has emerged as LinkedIn’s fastest-growing market for profile verification, Rodriguez said, with adoption rising about 80% over the past 12 months.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is already one of LinkedIn’s largest and fastest-growing user markets globally, with <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology-india-emerges-as-linkedins-fastest-growing-market-with-16-crore-users-3969636/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 160 million users</a>, and the pace of verification adoption there is unfolding alongside broader growth in professional networking, hiring, and remote work on the platform. This underscores how shifts in India’s workforce are increasingly shaping LinkedIn’s global usage patterns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As verification adoption has grown, LinkedIn has also begun extending those signals beyond its own platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, the Microsoft-owned company launched its “Verified on LinkedIn” program, allowing partner platforms to display LinkedIn verification badges. Zoom is the most recent partner for this move, joining companies such as Adobe and G2. The company also recently introduced a self-serve API to make it easier for other organizations to integrate verification into their own services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn says profile verification is associated with higher engagement on the platform, with verified members seeing up to 60% more profile views and around 50% more interaction on their posts compared with unverified users. Verified company pages also tend to attract more attention, recording significantly higher views and follower growth, the company stated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Verifications provide a powerful signal of authenticity on LinkedIn, helping to support authenticity and trust,” said Rodriguez. “Members with verifications are far more likely to represent real people, and jobs with verifications of the page, and hirer maintain significantly higher integrity and safety standards.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The last decade is filled with examples of fintechs that have reshaped how U.S. businesses manage money. Brex simplified corporate cards. Ramp automated spend controls. Mercury rebuilt startup banking. But this wave of financial innovation has largely skipped one major part of the economy: nonprofits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://givefront.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Givefront</a>, a YC-backed startup founded by 21-year-old Harvard dropout <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-tengtrakool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Matt Tengtrakool</a> and UC Berkeley’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidan-sunbury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Aidan Sunbury</a>, aims to change that. The company is building a financial platform designed specifically for nonprofits, including food banks, animal rescues, non-governmental organizations, churches, and homeowner associations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonprofits generate <a href=\"https://healthysector.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">roughly 6% of the U.S. GDP and contribute trillions of dollars</a> each year, yet most still rely on outdated financial tools. Givefront believes that modern spend management, compliance, and reporting infrastructure — tailored to nonprofit realities — can unlock significant efficiency gains across the sector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before starting Givefront, Tengtrakool experimented with a microloan aggregation startup in Nigeria. He later worked inside several nonprofits while studying computer science and statistics at Harvard, including running a few organizations himself. At one nonprofit, he helped grow donations to nearly $500,000. Tengtrakool says these experiences revealed a clear gap that nonprofits face. They have strict regulatory and reporting requirements but lack the tools that modern businesses take for granted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve always been interested in financial systems, and this work fits naturally with that,” the chief executive told TechCrunch. “While helping run these nonprofits with a few other students, we realized most of them didn’t have adequate financial tools to ensure compliance or protect their tax-exempt status. The tools they relied on were completely out of sync with what’s considered modern in the startup world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tengtrakool initially built the first version of Givefront to solve those problems internally. What started as tooling for organizations he worked with soon expanded to local nonprofits across the country. Over time, the team narrowed its focus to a unified financial platform built exclusively for registered nonprofit organizations, <a href=\"https://healthysector.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about 1.9 million of them</a> in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Givefront entered Y Combinator Winter 2024 with a broad vision spanning banking and accounting. The team quickly learned, however, that convincing nonprofits to replace accountants or core banking relationships required a slow and painful sales process, ushering a pivot to cards and spend management.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s much easier to get an organization to switch the card they use than to replace their entire accounting stack,” Tengtrakool said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Givefront offers features similar to corporate spend platforms like Ramp and Brex, its exclusive focus on nonprofits sets it apart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonprofits operate under constraints most businesses never face. They manage restricted and unrestricted grants, report spending to donors and foundations, track volunteer expenses, and file IRS Form 990 disclosures. Many nonprofits manage dozens of grants at once, each with its own spending and reporting rules.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Legacy nonprofit systems such as Blackbaud, Sage, and MIP still dominate the market, but they often lack real-time spend controls, modern approval workflows, and seamless integrations with the tools nonprofits increasingly depend on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than replacing these systems outright, Givefront positions itself as a vertical layer that sits on top of them. The platform integrates with legacy accounting software while adding nonprofit-specific spend controls, receipt capture for audits, grant-based budgeting, and automated reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many of the workflows we’re building are deeply specific to how this part of the economy works,” Tengtrakool said. “Our workflows and integrations are a 10x improvement when compared to traditional corporate or spend management tools.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Givefront generates revenue from card interchange and subscriptions tied to its bill pay feature. Over time, Givefront plans to expand revenues by launching adjacent products, including payroll, banking, budgeting, and potentially investment and endowment management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching its cards roughly six months ago, Givefront has onboarded hundreds of organizations and reports more than 200% month-over-month growth in revenue and total payment volume. The company expects to serve about 1,000 nonprofits by the end of the year, with a longer-term goal of reaching 5,000 organizations by mid-next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tengtrakool says the team’s youth, which also includes a 17-year-old founding engineer, has served as both an advantage and a challenge so far. Some nonprofit leaders find the team’s age refreshing, while others hesitate to trust financial infrastructure to such a young group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Churches and religious organizations have driven the strongest adoption, he says. Many rely on volunteer treasurers instead of full-time finance staff, and Givefront’s automation significantly reduces their operational burden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recently closed a $2 million round, led by Script Capital with participation from Y Combinator, C3 Ventures, Phoenix Fund, and angels, including the CEOs of Chariot and Wealthfront. The seed investment will help the company scale distribution, grow its team, and expand its cards and bill pay offerings.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Last week, industry representatives <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/fusion-energy-industry-presses-us-government-billions-support-2025-12-09/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">met with Energy Department officials</a>, urging them to help direct billions of dollars toward fusion projects, and earlier this year, the DOE announced a <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-fusion-science-and-technology-roadmap-accelerate-commercial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new roadmap</a> to guide commercial efforts in the sector, though it didn’t commit any new funds alongside the announcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG is the parent company of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/\">Truth Social,</a> the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/\">launch</a>, the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG went public last year via a merger with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/\">special-purpose acquisition company</a> (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-25-040977.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">only one experimental device</a> has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</a> and Sam Altman-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">Helion</a>, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">in the race</a> to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/google-places-another-fusion-power-bet-on-tae-technologies/\">recent $150 million round</a> from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update 12:05 p.m. ET: Added comments from fusion industry insiders.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The funding comes more than a year after the startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/indias-etherealx-puts-5m-seed-toward-fully-reusable-launch-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised a $5 million seed round</a> in August 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TDK Ventures is co-leading the round with Vietnam-based venture capital firm BIG Capital, with Accel also participating, the sources said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding talks follow EtherealX securing $130 million worth of contracts from six customers, the sources told TechCrunch, underscoring early commercial demand for its launch services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair alongside former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar, who serves as chief operating officer, and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma, the chief technology officer, EtherealX is aiming to take on SpaceX with a medium-lift launch vehicle called Razor Crest Mk-1. The rocket, designed to be fully reusable, is expected to place up to eight tonnes into low Earth orbit and will also be capable of delivering payloads to geostationary transfer and trans-lunar injection orbits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based startup says its launch system will offer cost efficiencies to customers while helping to address a global shortage of launch capacity, with a first launch targeted for early 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Nair said EtherealX’s rocket could offer launch prices ranging from about $350 to $2,000 per kilogram.

Its growing space tech ecosystem is also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/indias-digantara-raises-50m-for-space-based-missile-defence-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">attracting global investors</a> seeking markets that can complement space development in the United States, Europe, and other key regions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EtherealX has secured 16 acres of land in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which it plans to make operational early next year. The startup has also been developing key components, including a liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump assembly for its upper-stage engine, known as Pegasus 2.0, according to a recent LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7404121855927836673/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> by Nair.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is aiming to dramatically expand its footprint in the global commercial space industry, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/india-targets-45-billion-space-economy-driven-by-private-firms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">targeting an 8% to 10% market share</a> over the next decade from less than 2% today, with much of that growth expected to be driven by private startups.

But with the new AI models and advances in computer vision, its founders are confident the technology is ready for the masses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The duo is using their experience with self-driving cars to apply concepts of robotics perception and 3D vision for the 3D reconstruction of video in sports. This system can reduce the camera requirement from over 100 to as few as 32, helping decrease cost and operational overhead, according to Cui and Khan. The startup aims to keep the hardware cost as minimal as possible for teams and broadcasters and sign multi-year contracts for its platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software platform will bring biomechanical data of players and stats for teams and leagues using its own sensor stack, which is similar to the sensors on self-driving cars that capture the scene with depth. It will enable new ways to control the viewing of the play for broadcasters and fans using photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology. For instance, if fans wanted to track only the player with the ball, they could do that. They can also freeze a moment in-game to see different angles for a foul or a critical moment in play.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we work with off-the-shelf cameras, the way we package it with our experience in robotics and ML is what gives us an edge both in terms of platforms and also scaling from small practice enclosures to big soccer and football stadiums,” Cui said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the software side, the platform said it can observe different joints, including finger movements of players, to measure flexion. For instance, in the video above of two people playing football (soccer), the system measures flexion of knees and ankles. This could give coaches more ideas about body positioning and the flexibility of a player, and help them improve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has raised a $3.6 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Daybreak Capital, Entrepreneurs First, and Transpose Platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joe Ros, a partner at Entrepreneurs First, noted the fund was surprised by how big a following the founders and their autonomous driving team have at the University of Toronto. He noted investors are often hesitant to invest in sports-related startups, but Peripheral Labs is also an entertainment play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Their ultimate viewer is the consumer, and their demand for sports content is evergreen, not cyclical. With Peripheral, the new standard for that consumption will be immersive, volumetric video. And the work they’re doing now in sports will give them the data, tech, and deployment moat to be the only person in the market able to enable this,” he told TechCrunch over email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peripheral Labs said the startup was selective about the VCs they were bringing in, who could help in different areas like product development and go-to-market advice. The company has 10 engineers on its staff and aims to increase headcount with a focus on platform and hardware development to reduce costs for the company, decrease the latency of the system, and also increase the resolution of 3D reconstruction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup hasn’t made any public announcements about the partners it is working with, but said it is in conversation with several teams and leagues in North America. The company competes with other startups like <a href=\"https://arcturus.studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arcturus Studios</a> in the volumetric capture for sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These evenings offer a chance to step back from the blur of headlines and hype cycles, to sit with the people actually driving change, and to understand what’s really happening behind the scenes. They’ve been designed from the start as cocktail parties with killer content — we’ve always wanted these to be intimate gatherings where the conversation flows freely, and speakers can let their guard down in ways they simply can’t at larger, more formal conferences.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-full-2025-strictlyvc-recap\">The full 2025 StrictlyVC recap</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking back, 2025 was truly a blur of both insights and amazing connections. It’s almost hard to believe now how many stimulating conversations we were able to facilitate — from heads of state to startup founders, from crypto evangelists to defense tech pioneers. And each evening brought its own energy and revelations.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-it-started-san-francisco\">Where it started: San Francisco</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We kicked off this past year in San Francisco’s Presidio, where Kirsten Green of Forerunner Ventures co-hosted an unforgettable night. Green herself — an early investor in Chime, Oura, and countless other household brands — shared her excitement about the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/forerunners-long-game-as-startups-stall-before-ipo-all-options-are-on-the-table/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">white space</a> emerging at the intersection of AI and consumer tech. But she was just the beginning. We heard from Ethan Thornton of Mach Industries about the wild ride of building a defense tech startup in your twenties, complete with all the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/how-a-hydrogen-explosion-led-a-teenage-founder-to-become-sequoias-first-defense-tech-investment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">missteps</a> that come with the territory. Tarek Mansour of Kalshi captivated the room, explaining in his entertainingly blasé way why regulators <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/kalshi-ceo-state-law-doesnt-really-apply-to-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">don’t keep him up at night</a>, even as CEO of the industry’s hottest prediction market. Ryan Petersen of Flexport had plenty to say about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/07/flexport-ceo-ryan-petersens-high-stakes-test-amid-tariff-turmoil-you-cant-be-freaking-out/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trump’s tariff plans</a>.

(Rivian says the software will re-engage if a driver uses their turn signal and handles the turn manually.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an important step forward for the company, which is aiming to make its vehicles capable of full autonomy over the next few years. But it also comes with risk: Rival automakers with similar systems like Tesla and Ford have dealt with multiple crashes and deaths, many related to drivers’ attention straying from the driver assistance systems. Those crashes have led to investigations and lawsuits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated software greatly expands the driver assistance capabilities that were previously available to Rivian owners. Before the update, Rivian’s hands-free driving system only worked on 135,000 miles of highways. Rivian detailed plans at last week’s event to eventually allow its vehicles to drive themselves from “point-to-point,” though that feature will not ship until 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is developing a new autonomy computer with custom silicon for its R2 SUV (which debuts in 2026) that, combined with a roof-mounted lidar sensor, will be capable of one day making the company’s vehicles fully autonomous, CEO RJ Scaringe said last week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software update released Thursday brings a few other features not related to Rivian’s driver assistance system. There’s a new version of its digital key that owners of second-generation R1 vehicles can add to digital wallets on iPhones, Apple Watches, Google Pixels, and Samsung phones. Owners of quad-motor variants of the Gen 2 R1 EVs are also getting the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/the-tech-behind-rivians-2026-quad-motor-truck-and-suv-and-that-kick-turn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">long-teased “Kick Turn” feature</a>, as well as the “RAD Tuner” customizable drive modes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
