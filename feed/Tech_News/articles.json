Trump <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/president-trump-repeals-bidens-ai-executive-order/\">repealed Biden’s order within days of his inauguration</a>, arguing that its requirements could be onerous for AI companies, and may hinder American innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its first six months, the Trump Administration has broadly encouraged efforts to accelerate the development and distribution of American AI technology. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">Trump helped OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announce their multi-billion dollar Stargate data center project</a>, and the President <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/\">peeled back restrictions on Nvidia</a> selling its AI chips around the globe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, Trump’s AI czar David Sacks has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/trumps-silicon-valley-advisers-have-ai-censorship-in-their-crosshairs/\">picked a fight with technology companies over “woke” AI</a>, claiming that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are supposedly instilling left-leaning values into their AI chatbots and censoring conservative viewpoints. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some are already pushing back on Trump’s AI Action plan for allegedly putting corporate interests ahead of the public. On Tuesday, a group of more than 90 organizations including labor, environmental justice, and consumer protection non-profits <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://peoplesaiaction.com/\">published an open letter called the People’s AI Action Plan</a>. This puts forth a series of AI policies that claim to put the interests of American citizens first, and counter what Trump is expected to announce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can’t let Big Tech and Big Oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families’ well-being,” the group said in a statement to TechCrunch that acknowledged the energy needs of Silicon Valley’s AI data centers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI Action Plan should advance his administration’s agenda more explicitly, but exactly how remains unclear. Trump is expected to share more details about the plan at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/president-donald-j-trump-to-deliver-keynote-address-at-winning-the-ai-race-summit-hosted-by-allin-podcast-and-hill--valley-forum-302505499.html\">the “Winning the AI Race” summit</a>, an event hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum and the All In podcast, which Sacks co-hosts when he’s not serving as a government official or venture capitalist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s what we know about the AI Action Plan so far.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-accelerating-american-ai\">Accelerating American AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI strategy is expected to focus on three pillars — infrastructure, innovation, and global influence — according to a report from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://time.com/7304389/trump-ai-action-plan/\">Time Magazine</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For infrastructure, the Trump administration is reportedly planning to overhaul permitting rules to speed up the development of AI data centers. This aims to help AI companies meet with the growing energy needs to train and serve their AI models. However, it’s widely expected that the rise of AI data centers — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\">which suck up immense amounts of energy and water from neighboring communities</a> — could <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works\">cause energy shortages by the end of the decade</a> unless there’s a rapid increase in energy production.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The president’s infrastructure pillar is also expected to include a plan to modernize America’s electrical grid and add new sources of energy to power these data centers, according to Time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the innovation front, Trump reportedly plans to use his AI Action Plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/\">revive the conversation around blocking state AI laws</a> (even though a federal proposition on the issue <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/us-senate-removes-controversial-ai-moratorium-from-budget-bill/\">overwhelmingly failed last month</a>). This is part of an effort to reduce barriers to innovation for American AI companies, but may ultimately block lawmakers from passing meaningful safety and security standards for AI companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the global influence pillar, Trump is expected to put forth a strategy to advance the adoption of American AI models and chips, not just in the U.S., but around the world. Federal officials were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape/\">spooked by the rise of the DeepSeek,</a> and other Chinese AI labs such as Qwen and Moonshot AI have since become worthy competitors to OpenAI. Trump wants America’s technology to be the global standard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To advance its goals, the Trump administration is also expected to sign a series of AI-related executive orders on Wednesday, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/22/tech-brief-trump-ai-action-plan/\">The Washington Post.</a> Some of these orders clear the path for faster data center buildouts, while others encourage the export of American technologies.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-combatting-woke-ai\">Combatting ‘woke’ AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the executive orders Trump is slated to sign Wednesday would crackdown on “woke” AI models, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24?mod=e2tw\">the Wall Street Journal</a> reported earlier this week. The order requires AI companies with federal contracts — which includes OpenAI, xAI, Google, and Anthropic — to ensure their AI models have neutral and unbiased language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The crackdown on “woke” AI marks the Republican party’s latest attack on Silicon Valley’s historically left-leaning crowd. In past years, Republican investigated social media companies for allegedly altering their algorithms to censor conservative voices. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently capitulated to these allegations, and overhauled <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/meta-drops-fact-checking-and-loosens-its-content-moderation-rules/\">Facebook and Instagram’s content moderation</a> to represent more voices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key question looming around this executive order is who defines whether AI models are neutral or biased, and how they determine it. Trump has long stated he’s an advocate of free speech, so an executive order setting rules around what an AI model can and can’t say may seem counterintuitive. That said, a Florida judge recently ruled that AI chatbots <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/florida-judge-rules-ai-chatbots-not-protected-by-first-amendment/\">are not protected by the First Amendment</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In light of this crack down, OpenAI and other AI labs have tried to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/16/openai-tries-to-uncensor-chatgpt/\">make their AI chatbots represent more viewpoints</a>. These companies are in the awkward position to generate AI responses that please everyone, while also not spreading extremist viewpoints or misinformation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elon Musk, once Trump’s greatest financial backer whose relationship with the president has recently soured, explicitly started xAI to develop an “anti-woke” AI chatbot, Grok, and combat ChatGPT. However, xAI’s effort to create such a chatbot hasn’t gone so well. In recent weeks, xAI was forced to apologize repeatedly when its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/grok-is-being-antisemitic-again-and-also-the-sky-is-blue/\">AI chatbot went on antisemitic rants</a> and<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-4-seems-to-consult-elon-musk-to-answer-controversial-questions/\"> consulted Musk’s personal opinions</a> on hot-button issues.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-silicon-valley-and-big-tech-want\">What Silicon Valley and Big Tech want</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The White House announced in April it had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/public-comments-to-white-house-on-ai-policy-touch-on-copyright-tariffs/\">received more than 10,000 public comments</a> from companies, local governments, and nonprofit organizations regarding Trump’s AI Action Plan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Amazon effectively took the opportunity to submit wishlists of friendly AI policies they’d like to see the Trump administration implement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of America’s leading AI model developers asked Trump to use his AI Action plan to guarantee that training large language models on copyrighted material would be fair use, and should therefore be allowed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such a protection could benefit these companies significantly, as many of them are involved in active lawsuits with copyright owners from the music, film, news, and book industries. These publishers have accused AI companies of illegally training on their copyrighted works to make AI models, potentially devaluing their media in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Meta asked Trump to protect open AI models — which are freely available to download online. By releasing its Llama models openly, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/metas-llamacon-was-all-about-undercutting-openai/\">Meta has been able to undercut OpenAI and Google’s closed offerings</a>. However, Anthropic has raised concerns over whether open AI models could leak powerful technology to bad actors, including China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other interest groups, including nonprofits such as The Future of Life Institute, used the commenting period to ask the Trump administration to increase investment into AI research efforts outside of commercial entities. The request comes at a time when the Trump administration and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/02/11/doge-musk-education-department-research/78411180007/\">DOGE have slashed funding for American universities</a>, many of which have been powerhouses for scientific breakthroughs in recent decades.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems unlikely that Trump’s AI action plan will feature the same safety and security reporting standards that the Biden administration sought to impose. However, polls show that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theaipi.org/april-voters-prefer-ai-regulation-over-self-regulation/\">most Americans want AI companies to be held to safety standards</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several state lawmakers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/new-york-passes-a-bill-to-prevent-ai-fueled-disasters/\">pushing bills that would create safety and security reporting mandates</a>, but they may face opposition from the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers should they contradict Trump’s AI Action Plan..</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Customers can choose to add protection for more devices for $5.99 per month each. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until now, people have had to enroll their Apple devices into separate AppleCare+ plans if they wanted additional coverage for their products beyond the standard warranty. Now, the company is offering bundled coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AppleCare One includes all of the benefits of AppleCare+, including unlimited repairs for accidents like drops or spills, 24/7 support from Apple experts, and battery coverage. AppleCare One adds theft and loss protection beyond iPhone to also cover iPad and Apple Watch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the first time ever, Apple is letting customers add AppleCare coverage to the Apple products they already own. With the new subscription plan, customers can add most products up to 4 years old if they are in good condition. To verify that a device is in “good condition,” it may be required to undergo a diagnostic check using a customer’s iPhone or iPad, or at an Apple Store, before being added to the plan.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?w=486\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030164\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg 2743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=857,1200 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=914,1280 914w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=307,430 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=514,720 514w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=643,900 643w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=571,800 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=1463,2048 1463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=477,668 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=268,375 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=441,617 441w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=379,531 379w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=36,50 36w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AppleCare One pricing is the same regardless of the products that are covered, meaning a customer can enroll their iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, and save up to $11 a month over enrolling in separate AppleCare+ plans for each device,” Apple explained in a press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means that if someone buys AppleCare One when they purchase a new MacBook Pro and add their iPhone to the plan, they will already be saving money by not having two separate AppleCare+ plans. Plus, they will get even more value if they include another device, like an Apple Watch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Only devices in the customer’s Apple Account can be covered under AppleCare One, Apple says.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For users who just want protection for one device, Apple says that they can continue to sign up for AppleCare+.

These accounts will automatically be placed into the app’s strictest message settings to prevent unwanted messages, and will have the platform’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/in-the-wake-of-recent-racist-attacks-instagram-rolls-out-more-anti-abuse-features/\">“Hidden Words” feature</a> enabled to filter offensive comments. The company is also rolling out new safety features for teen accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accounts that will be placed into the new, stricter message settings include ones run by adults who regularly share photos and videos of their children, along with accounts run by parents or talent managers that represent children.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While these accounts are overwhelmingly used in benign ways, unfortunately, there are people who may try to abuse them, leaving sexualized comments under their posts or asking for sexual images in DMs, in clear violation of our rules,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/07/sharing-latest-updates-metas-child-safety-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “Today we’re announcing steps to help prevent this abuse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it will attempt to prevent potentially suspicious adults, such as people who have already been blocked by teens, from finding accounts that primarily feature children. Meta will avoid recommending suspicious adults to these accounts on Instagram, and vice versa, and make it harder for them to find each other in Instagram Search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s announcement comes as Meta and Instagram have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/08/meta-introduces-restricted-teen-accounts-to-facebook-and-messenger/\">taken steps</a> over the past year to address mental health concerns tied to social media. These concerns have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/10/state-attorneys-endorse-social-media-warning-labels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised by the U.S. Surgeon General</a> and various states, some of which have even <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/to-protect-teens-on-social-media-new-york-targets-the-algorithms-8b5feaae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">gone so far as to require</a> parental consent for access to social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes will significantly impact the accounts of family vloggers/creators and parents running accounts for “kidfluencers,” both of which have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-dangers-of-parents-sharing-their-childrens-lives-on-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">faced criticism for the risks associated</a> with sharing children’s lives on social media.

Fertilizer runoff from farm fields has led to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)\">dead zones</a> in oceans around the world, where low oxygen levels have starved normally teeming coastal waters of life itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eliminating synthetic fertilizers is a tall order, but one startup thinks that its bacteria can eliminate up to half of it, all while undercutting fertilizer on cost.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nzn2.com/\">NetZeroNitrogen</a> has developed a suite of bacterial strains that is applied directly to the seed and allows the plant to get nitrogen from the atmosphere instead of chemicals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a precision sniper approach,” Justin Hughes, co-founder and CEO of NetZeroNitrogen, told TechCrunch. “In contrast to fertilizer, where you spread it all over the field and effectively hope some hits the target, a kind of shotgun approach.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup recently raised a $6.6 million seed round led by World Fund and Azolla Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NetZeroNitrogen’s bacteria are the product of over a decade of research on the part of Gary Devine, who has been studying naturally occurring nitrogen-fixing strains. Hughes pointed out that the company’s bacteria aren’t genetically modified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not on any particular moral high ground about that. It just means the regulatory pathway is a lot easier,” he said. “It opens you up to organic markets as well.” Once the plant dies, the bacteria dies with it.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to roll out its first product for rice. It’s partially a marriage of convenience: to apply the bacterial strains, it’s currently easiest to dunk seeds in water containing them. Rice just so happens to be soaked before planting. “You just mix it in at that point and you’re done,” Hughes said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the company can use large fermenters to grow its strains, it can make its bacterial amendment for less than an equivalent amount of synthetic fertilizer, Hughes said. “The costs of production of biomanufacturing are far, far lower than the Haber-Bosch process, especially once you start to scale up,” he said, referring to the process widely used to make fertilizer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal, Hughes added, is to sell NetZeroNitrogen’s bacteria to farmers for at least $50 per hectare less than they spend on synthetic fertilizers. In regions like Southeast Asia, that could mean a 30% to 40% discount, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, synthetic fertilizer won’t be disappearing. “Unfortunately, we can’t quite solve 100% of the problem yet,” Hughes said. “But of the proportion that we can solve, it’s effectively 100% efficiency.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These rounds — the startup’s first in roughly a decade — valued Gupshup at $1.4 billion. However, Fidelity, which led the round following its unicorn milestone, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/30/fidelity-deepens-valuation-cut-for-saas-startup-gupshup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slashed its internal valuation</a> of the startup at least three times between 2023 and 2024, bringing it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/30/gupshup-investor-cuts-value-of-its-stake-by-65-implying-new-valuation-of-486m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">down to as low as $486 million</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding round, which combines equity and debt financing from Globespan Capital Partners and EvolutionX Debt Capital, aims to help the San Francisco-headquartered startup expand its presence across its high-growth markets, including India, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup would not reveal the exact debt portion although its founder and CEO Beerud Seth told TechCrunch that the equity part is “a little more than half.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2004, Gupshup — derived from Indian slang meaning “conversations” — started as a platform to help businesses connect with their customers through text messages. It gained popularity as text messages were not free at the time, and people were seeking ways to send messages to their friends and community groups. However, as communication shifted from short messaging service (SMS) to WhatsApp and Rich Communication Services (RCS), the startup moved to these avenues with its chatbot services. Now, as AI has become a catchall term, and AI agents — software that can perform specific tasks on behalf of users — have emerged everywhere, Gupshup has started enabling businesses to deploy agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a lot of demand coming from enterprises. Everybody needs to build these AI agents, which work through messaging like RCS and WhatsApp or through voice. So, building out these agents, there’s huge demand, and we need to support it,” Seth said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Globally, AI agents are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/saas-is-in-the-past-the-future-belongs-to-agents-says-narada-ais-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gaining traction</a>, with startups building them drawing strong investor interest. Tech giants like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/aws-is-launching-an-ai-agent-marketplace-next-week-with-anthropic-as-a-partner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/googles-ai-agents-will-bring-you-the-web-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/microsoft-gives-its-ai-dev-tools-for-windows-a-fresh-coat-of-paint/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft</a> are also exploring how to bring more of these agents to users through their own platforms. The result: competition is heating up.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupshup does not view the rising competition as a threat. Seth pointed to the startup’s substantial install base — which exceeds 50,000 customers across more than 100 countries — and its track record of product innovation, driven by years of experience in business messaging, strategic acquisitions, and internal R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Businesses cannot use simple foundation models off the shelf and just put them in front of customers. They need a lot of customization to be done, and that’s where Gupshup comes in. That’s what we provide,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its last round in July 2021, the startup “tripled” its revenue and grew its profitability, Sheth said. However, it is unclear whether that resulted in an increased valuation, as, he said, this latest round was not priced.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a founder, you focus on value, and the valuation will follow,” Seth said when asked whether he still considers the startup a unicorn. “We operate ourselves like we are going to be a big company.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside expanding geographically, the startup aims to utilize its fresh funding to enhance its products, which are used in industries including automotive, banking, e-commerce, fintech, media, payments, retail, and travel. Its products also include click-to-chat ads, an AI campaign copilot, agent assist, and campaign manager.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupshup claims to power over 120 billion messages annually for thousands of enterprises. Looking ahead, the startup sees an IPO as its next major milestone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re talking to all our advisors, lawyers, bankers, accountants, and so on, to figure this out,” Seth said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has no specific timeline for its public listing, although Seth told TechCrunch that it could happen in 18–24 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupshup is exploring whether it should list on Indian stock exchanges — a move that makes strategic sense, as the startup views India, where WhatsApp dominates, as a more favorable market. Among the reasons: it’s easier to communicate its story to local retail investors, who are more familiar with WhatsApp and understand how Gupshup’s products, including its AI agents, operate within the platform. However, since Gupshup is domiciled in the U.S., a flip to India would trigger tax liabilities, which could require additional funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The IPO “is the one thing that we don’t control entirely. The calendar depends as much on external factors as it does on the company,” Seth said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The platform will allow users to pay others using their local wallets and payment systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said the launch partners include India’s NPCI International Payments Limited, which operates mobile payments framework UPI (Unified Payment Interface), China’s Tenpay Global (Tencent’s Payment arm), which operates Weixin (WeChat) payment ecosystem in the country, along with PayPal and Venmo.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also signed an memorandum of understanding with Latin America’s Mercado Pago, a fintech company that enables card and mobile payments, while the final details of the deals are being ironed out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With these partnerships, PayPal wants to cover more than two billion users across the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“PayPal World is a first-of-its-kind payments ecosystem that will bring together many of the world’s largest payment systems and digital wallets on a single platform,” Alex Chriss, President and CEO of PayPal said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The challenge of moving money across borders is incredibly complex, and yet this platform will make it so simple for nearly two billion consumers and businesses. We believe the changes we are announcing today have the potential to be a real game changer over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fintech company said that through PayPal World, PayPal and Venmo users will be able to send money to anyone in the world, even if they aren’t a PayPal user. For instance, when they are traveling in China, they can use PayPal on the Wexin payment network to pay to local businesses. On the flip side, if a customer from India is buying from a site in the U.S., they can use PayPal to check out and pay through their UPI wallet. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Total user base and transaction volume of these wallet systems are massive.

But at a $50 price point, Bee’s devices are more cost-accessible to a curious consumer who doesn’t want to make a big financial commitment. (The ill-fated Humane AI Pin was $499.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that Bee employees received offers to join Amazon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This acquisition signals Amazon’s interest in developing wearable AI devices, a different avenue from its voice-controlled home assistant products like its line of Echo speakers.

The app does store data that the AI learns about the user, however, which is how it can function as an assistant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee previously indicated that it planned to only record the voices of people who have verbally consented. Bee also says it’s working on a feature to allow users to define boundaries — both based on topic and location — that will automatically pause the device’s learning. The company noted that it plans to build on-device AI processing, which generally poses less of a privacy risk than processing data in the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if these policies will change as Bee is integrated into Amazon, however — and Amazon has a mixed record on the handling of user data from its customers’ devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, Amazon <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/ring-reveals-they-give-videos-police-without-user-consent-or-warrant\">shared footage</a> with law enforcement from people’s personal Ring security cameras, with neither the owner’s consent, nor a warrant.

Now, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has confirmed the details of the contract (but not the dollar amount) in <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1947640330318156074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an X post</a> on Tuesday and in <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/stargate-advances-with-partnership-with-oracle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a company blog post.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To recap, on June 30, Oracle disclosed in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001341439/000119312525152035/d136779d8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an SEC filing</a> that it had signed a cloud deal that would generate $30 billion a year in revenue. However, the company didn’t say who it was with or for what services. The news caused Oracle’s stock to hit an all-time high, making its founder and CTO, Larry Ellison, the second richest person in the world, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/who-is-larry-ellison-and-how-did-he-amass-a-251-billion-fortune\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Bloomberg.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speculation <a href=\"https://www.futuriom.com/articles/news/can-this-be-oracles-30-billion-customer/2025/07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on the identity</a> of the customer ensued as people wondered what company could possibly need a fresh $30 billion a year in data center services. For comparison, Oracle collectively sold $24.5 billion worth of cloud services in its fiscal 2025 to all customers combined, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001341439/000095017025087926/orcl-20250531.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it reported</a> in June.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has now explained that this Oracle deal is for 4.5 gigawatts of capacity as part of Stargate, the $500 billion data-center-building project OpenAI, Oracle, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">and SoftBank announced in January.</a> (Apparently, the $30 billion deal does not involve SoftBank.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The WSJ reports 4.5 gigawatts is the equivalent of two Hoover Dams, enough power for about four million homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t a straightforward win for Oracle. OpenAI and Oracle still have to build this monster data center, which will be a costly endeavor, both in cash and in energy. They are doing so at what OpenAI called the Stargate I site in Abilene, Texas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Oracle spent $21.2 billion on capital expenditures in its last fiscal year, CEO Safra Catz <a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/oracle-corporation-nyseorcl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript-1552014/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=msn-news#q-and-a-session\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported in June</a>, and it expects to spend another $25 billion this year, she said. So, nearly $50 billion, largely spent on data centers (and that doesn’t include land purchases, she said) in two years. Although, to be clear, that money also supports Oracle’s existing customers, in addition to OpenAI’s demands.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One final interesting part to note about all of this: Last month, Altman said that OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/openai-claims-to-have-hit-10b-in-annual-revenue/\">recently hit $10 billion</a> in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year.

The request, which was made in July, is a temporary stopgap while the company awaits federal clearance to dredge a permanent channel to the Wallops Island site.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab plans to launch its Neutron medium-lift rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia, a lower-traffic spaceport that’s surrounded by shallow channels and waterways. The company currently launches its Electron small rocket from this location. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab has a sizable checklist to tick off before Neutron can make its orbital debut, like mating the rocket stages, performing a “wet dress” rehearsal, and getting its launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before any of that can happen, the rocket hardware needs to make it onto the island. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab submitted an application for the dredging project to the Virginia Marine Resources Commission in March. In its application, the company touted the benefits of MARS, noting other launch facilities in Florida and elsewhere are highly congested, which could limit launch cadence. MARS, in contrast, “will allow both frequent launch cadence and the return-to-Earth capability of recovering boosters,” Rocket Lab said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite that upside, MARS is constrained in a crucial way: Existing maritime infrastructure is limited, and access to the channel — called Sloop Gut — depends on favorable tides. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Rocket Lab and its co-applicant, Virginia Port Authority, notes in its request, “there is no permanent existing means of providing safe and reliable access for large infrastructure deliveries to Wallops Island.” (Electron is substantially smaller and delivered via road.)  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab has poured millions into the MARS site to ensure it’s ready to support regular Neutron launches. The company is planning to spend more than $5 million to dredge the roughly mile-long Sloop Gut so barges can perform regular deliveries of large Neutron rocket components. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030163\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png 1668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1200,783 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1280,835 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=430,280 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=720,470 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=900,587 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=800,522 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1536,1002 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=668,436 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=575,375 575w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=946,617 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=708,462 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Rocket lab’s plans to dredge sloop gut.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Rocket Lab</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dredging project was approved by VMRC in May, but the company has yet to start digging because it’s still awaiting federal sign-off from the Army Corps of Engineers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the company waits for federal approval, Rocket Lab and VPA are seeking permission to use a temporary method called “kedging” to ensure the first five hardware deliveries can arrive on schedule starting in September.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has said it plans to launch Neutron’s maiden test mission in the second half of 2025. But the dredging application and Rocket Lab’s separate kedging request suggest that it’s not hardware delays but maritime access that could be a bottleneck for the first launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kedging, a little-known nautical method, is used to ensure the barges can safely navigate the existing shallow channel. Workers would use a series of anchors and lines to steer the barge through the shallow waters. The company is seeking permission to use this method through the end of June 2026 or until the dredging work is complete, whichever comes first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear how long the dredging project will take. In the case that the kedging request is not approved in a timely manner, Rocket Lab said in its application that it would be able to transport structures over the beach using ramps and cranes. The company received permission for up to three beach barge landing test events — but these cannot take place between March 15 and August 31, so it is far from a long-term solution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the dredging application, the company detailed several other alternative methods to get hardware on the island, like transporting it by road or public boat ramp. However, these methods were ultimately deemed infeasible for reasons such as cost, infrastructure limitations, and the weather. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Both filings highlight the importance of maritime access for Rocket Lab’s Virginia ambitions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sooner the company can start dropping kedge anchors in time to receive the hardware shipments, the sooner it can start knocking off the rest of its pre-flight checklist.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Because of consumer demand for early releases, Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/apple-launches-a-public-beta-program-for-ios/\">for years</a> has been offering public betas following its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. This allows iPhone owners to also get their hands on the updated software before its wider, global launch, but with fewer stability issues and bugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest developer beta (iOS 26 beta 4) largely reflects what users can expect in the coming public beta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">iOS 26 beta 4 introduces a new “Welcome” splash screen when you first update the software, plus introductory screens for various features, like Siri and its AI-powered notification summaries and prioritization options, as well as for iOS 26’s <a href=\"https://x.com/entropy7th/status/1947722644305989657\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revamped</a> Camera app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, Apple was forced to put its AI notification summaries on pause after complaints by the BBC, which said the feature <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">had misrepresented one of its headlines.</a> The AI-powered news summary claimed Luigi Mangione, the person charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died by suicide, which wasn’t true. As a result, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/following-complaints-apple-to-further-clarify-when-notification-summaries-use-ai/\">Apple said a software update</a> would be released to clarify when the text shows an AI summarization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The setup screen for this AI summarization feature, still in beta, includes a warning message under the “News &amp; Entertainment” section. Here, Apple notes that “Summarization may change the meaning of the original headlines” and advises users to “Verify information.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other early adopters of the new beta also found that Apple is continuing to refine its user interface redesign known as Liquid Glass. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/ios-26-beta-3-dials-back-liquid-glass/\">beta 3 pulled back</a> on some of the more transparent elements in some apps, beta 4 reverses things again. Testers have pointed to updates in apps like the <a href=\"https://x.com/MehranKhanIX/status/1947725338781618685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">App Store, Photos</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/zollotech/status/1947709872629260331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apple</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1947711322948276240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1m6l8r1/comment/n4kir6k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Weather</a>, and elsewhere, and noted that the Notification Center <a href=\"https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1947713386084483378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also adds a dynamic tint</a> as you scroll.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated software <a href=\"https://x.com/zollotech/status/1947718964273918264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">additionally</a> includes a new dynamic wallpaper, which changes colors, and <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1947729632737833436\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new CarPlay wallpapers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Release notes for beta 4 had not been published on Apple’s Developer website at the time of publication, so there is likely more to be spotted, especially in terms of minor bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside today’s release, Apple also launched new versions of its other betas, including iPadOS 26 beta 4, macOS 26 beta 4, watchOS 26 beta 4, tvOS 26 beta 4, visionOS 26 beta 4, and Xcode 26 beta 4.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A subset of Etsy buyers and sellers began a boycott of the online marketplace this month over its decision to allow “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded merchandise on its site.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, this sort of merchandise — including T-shirts, hats, mugs, stickers, patches, and other items — can be found across e-commerce platforms beyond Etsy, ranging from large retailers like Amazon to online marketplaces like eBay to seller storefront providers like Shopify and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Etsy users have taken particular issue with the company’s decision to allow the merchandise, which celebrates the controversial ICE detention center in Florida, where detainees are held in cages and subjected to reportedly horrible conditions, according to outlets like the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alligator-alcatraz-immigration-detainees-florida-cc2fb9e34e760a50e97f13fe59cbf075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/alligator-alcatraz-immigration-florida-everglades-conditions-2100823\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Newsweek</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/07/16/alligator-alcatraz-conditions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/venezuelan-detainee-inhumane-conditions-alligator-alcatraz-cbs-miami/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CBS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/the-chaotic-early-days-inside-floridas-alligator-alcatraz-detention-center.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The NYT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2025/07/18/alligator-alcatraz-detainees-desantis-florida-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tampa Bay Times</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etsy, its users argue, has a published <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/discrimination-and-hateful-content/123551108902\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Discrimination and Hateful Content Policy</a>, which lists “immigration status” as a protected class — meaning both behavior and merchandise cannot contain or display discriminatory behavior toward the listed protected classes. Boycotters believe that Etsy is in violation of its policy, as the company notes that prohibited behavior includes not only hate speech, but also “content which directly or indirectly contains violent or degrading commentary against protected classes listed above.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030030\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg 2324w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=768,597 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=680,528 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=1200,933 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=1280,995 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=430,334 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=720,560 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=900,699 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=800,622 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=1536,1194 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=2048,1592 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=668,519 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=483,375 483w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=794,617 794w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=683,531 683w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/etsy-alligator-merch1.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Etsy’s site has 20 pages of “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded merchandise</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Etsy screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Etsy boycott has been loosely organized on social media platforms like Meta’s <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/search?q=Boycott%20Etsy&amp;serp_type=tags&amp;tag_id=18370523275075527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Threads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=etsy+boycott&amp;cId=158e8864-1645-4da9-89a6-e583d6e20f20&amp;iId=1e096200-c3d2-4ba0-adb0-49ae10ed7396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reddit</a> so far, where there are thousands of posts and comments. For example, <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@sarahzsays\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one Threads post</a> that references the boycott received more than 26,500 likes and a<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1lrwuz4/what_are_they_thinking_over_at_etsy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> Reddit post exclaiming “What are they thinking over at Etsy?!”</a> has 69,000 upvotes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When searching for the term “<a href=\"https://www.threads.com/search?q=Boycott%20Etsy&amp;serp_type=tags&amp;tag_id=18370523275075527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Boycott Etsy</a>” on Threads, you’ll find a long stream of posts debating the boycott, many of which have hundreds of replies. Some Etsy sellers worry their online businesses will suffer as a result, even though they are not selling this type of merchandise. Others, including those who disagree with the Trump administration’s policies, believe the merchandise is protected free speech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Reddit’s Etsy Community and elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@alainndesigns/post/DLnBQ1vu9Oi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">boycotting</a> <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@aprilgracebaker/post/DLm8oWtpchr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sellers</a> are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsyCommunity/comments/1lweevw/ive_been_horrified_by_what_etsy_is_allowing_and/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">threatening to close their shops</a>, and buyers say they’re <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/chaoticgood/comments/1lwkkg7/boycott_evil_fucking_etsy_sellers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closing</a> their accounts. There are also references to the boycott across other social media sites like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.walmart.com/search?q=Alligator%20Alcatraz\">X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@yaptrapped/video/7522951152758033677?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-8yF7uTQvoJ5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=boycott%20etsy\">Facebook</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the effort is so far only loosely organized, it’s difficult to tell how many are participating. According to data from app intelligence provider Appfigures, Etsy’s iOS app in the U.S. hasn’t slipped in the ranks at this time — it’s been in the top 20 apps in the Shopping category throughout the month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etsy is not alone in profiting from this type of merchandise, as some sellers and buyers have also pointed out. Many major selling platforms have not banned “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded products at this time. Among those TechCrunch reached out to, only Amazon was willing to defend its choice to host this merchandise, pointing us to its <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/amazons-approach-to-controversial-products-and-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">policy around controversial products and content</a>. The company also said the “Alligator Alcatraz” merchandise was compliant with its <a href=\"https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200164670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etsy did not respond to multiple requests for comment. eBay responded to an email request, but never shared a comment.

Among the three key proposals is a reporting requirement, which would aid authorities in identifying and disrupting hacking operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mandatory reporting is also being developed, which would equip law enforcement with essential intelligence to hunt down perpetrators and disrupt their activities, allowing for better support for victims,” read the proposal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ransomware-proposals-to-increase-incident-reporting-and-reduce-payments-to-criminals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its proposal</a>, the U.K. government said the mandatory reporting requirement would allow the government to “engage in targeted disruptions in an evolving threat landscape.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other two key proposals include a ban on paying ransomware for public sector and critical infrastructure organizations, and a mandate to notify the government if other types of victim organizations intend to pay a hacker’s ransom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ransomware investigators applauded the proposals, in particular the efforts focusing on helping law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it is a tacit acknowledgment of what we’ve known for a while: Ransomware operators and their enablers are not confined to Russia and many of those involved are very catchable and, more importantly, prosecutable,” Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst and ransomware expert at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. “I think it’s super important.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arda Büyükkaya, a senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at EclecticIQ, applauded the proposals for making “things official.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While it’s unclear whether everything will unfold exactly as written, we’ll see through future developments,” Büyükkaya told TechCrunch. “Overall, banning ransom payments and actively pursuing perpetrators is a strong deterrent and helps impose real costs on threat actors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tuesday’s announcement is the latest in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uk-plans-to-ban-public-sector-organizations-from-paying-ransomware-hackers/\">a policy consultation process that began in January</a>, in which the Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-proposals-to-protect-businesses-from-cybercrime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">initially introduced</a> the three key policy changes. The U.K. government’s formal response to the consultation is another step toward amending the law, but it remains to be seen if the proposals will end up being enshrined in legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Banning ransomware payments <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/04/should-we-ban-ransom-payments/\">is a controversial idea</a>. For some, banning payments to hackers is an obvious way to stop criminal gangs profiting from cyberattacks and extorting victims. But some argue that, occasionally, paying a ransom may be the only viable option to recover critical systems and get back online, especially for certain critical industries, such as hospitals, which cannot afford the downtime and the very real risks to patients’ health. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://therecord.media/australia-ransomware-victims-must-report-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Australia enacted a law</a> to mandate ransomware victims to disclose if they paid the hackers, stopping short of banning payments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We have also observed that users are now receiving calls from bad AI agents, and we are training our AI agent to tackle that,” <a href=\"https://www.cloaked.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cloaked</a> CEO Arjun Bhatnagar said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bhatnagar acknowledged that Apple and Google’s features are based on a similar premise. He said people sign up to try out these features, but retention numbers are low because of a lack of personalization, and that’s why startups like Cloaked can come in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While handling inbound calls is the first step for Cloaked, the company wants to enable an outbound call facility that deploys AI-bots to hold the line while on a customer support call or booking appointments. Cloaked is also working on an eSIM product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the startup is releasing a dark web monitor for personal data. The company observes different sources such as data brokers, breach sites, compromised websites, dark web forums, Discord, and Telegram for leaked user data. The tool searches for names, addresses, Social Security numbers, emails, family members, passports, and driver licenses.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It shows users an alert when it finds such leaked data.

Once exploited, an attacker can use the bug to remotely plant malware and gain access to the files and data stored within, as well as gain access to other systems on the same network.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post on Tuesday</a>, Microsoft said it had observed at least two previously identified China-backed hacking groups it calls “Linen Typhoon” and “Violet Typhoon” exploiting the SharePoint zero-day. Microsoft says Linen Typhoon is focused on stealing intellectual property, while Violet Typhoon steals private information to be used for espionage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft also attributed the ongoing hacks to a third China-backed hacking group it named “Storm-2603,” representing a hacking group about which the company has less information. The company noted, however, that the hackers have been linked to ransomware attacks in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Microsoft, the three hacking groups were observed exploiting the zero-day vulnerability to break into vulnerable SharePoint servers as far back as July 7.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Charles Carmakal, the chief technology officer at Google’s incident response unit Mandiant, told TechCrunch in an email that “at least one of the actors responsible” was a China-nexus hacking group, but noted that “multiple actors are now actively exploiting this vulnerability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dozens of organizations have already been hacked, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/hackers-exploiting-sharepoint-zero-day-seen-targeting-government-agencies-say-researchers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">including across the government sector</a>. The bug is regarded as a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">zero-day</a> because the vendor — Microsoft, in this case — had no time to issue a patch before it was actively exploited. Microsoft has <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">since rolled out patches for all affected versions of SharePoint</a>, but security researchers have warned that customers running self-hosted versions of SharePoint should assume they have already been compromised.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Chinese government has long rebuffed allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks, though it has not always explicitly denied its involvement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement that China “firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and cyber crime — a position that is consistent and clear.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest hacking campaign linked to China in recent years. Hackers backed by China were accused of targeting self-hosted Microsoft Exchange email servers in 2021 as part of a mass-hacking campaign.

The app also lets users sync all photos with VSCO’s cloud through the VSCO app, which means you can’t directly upload photos from the Capture app.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"VSCO Capture Walkthrough\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3psHeonx28?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Freelance Photographer offers various courses, starting from $208 per month for the basic coaching plan, and a $625 per month that gives subscribers access to over 50 tools, several courses, and personal mentoring from the company’s founder, Paul Weaver. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition fits neatly into VSCO’s aim of catering more to professional photographers. Last year, the company launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/vsco-launches-a-new-hub-to-connect-creators-and-brands/\">VSCO Hub</a>, to enable brands to discover photographers for different projects, and <a href=\"https://vsco.co/vsco/journal/introducing-vsco-sites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">VSCO Sites</a>, which lets photographers create web pages to show off their work. In May, the company launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/vsco-is-launching-an-ai-powered-collaborative-moodboard/\">VSCO Canvas</a>, a collaborative whiteboard product that lets users create moodboards for different projects.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Their AI compliance startup, <a href=\"https://delve.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Delve</a>, which announced a $3 million seed round in January, was growing fast and signing customers at a steady clip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, inbound interest started rolling in, COO Kocalar told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Delve, which automates regulatory compliance with AI agents, ended up fielding multiple term sheets, eventually closing a $32 million Series A at a $300 million valuation. The round was led by Insight Partners, which took up most of the round, with participation from CISOs at Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insight has been “amazing to work with, and we felt they were the right long-term partner for us,” said the COO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Delve’s new valuation represents a roughly 10x jump from its previous round. Similarly, its customer base has grown from the 100 companies it reported back in January to over 500, many of them fast-growing AI startups like recently minted AI unicorn Lovable, Bland, and Wispr Flow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while the 2-year-old company, made up of AI researchers from MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley, has seemingly struck gold by using AI to eliminate hundreds of hours of manual processes, its story began much differently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kaushik and Kocalar met as classmates during their freshman year at MIT. Both had deep interests in AI and health tech. Kaushik had already scaled a COVID diagnostic system to thousands of users during the pandemic. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, they began working on an AI-powered medical scribe to help doctors handle patient documentation. However, handling sensitive healthcare information meant they quickly encountered the costly and time-consuming world of HIPAA compliance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of continuing with the medical scribe, they started building tools to help other companies get HIPAA-compliant faster and more affordably. That pivot <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/delve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">got the team into Y Combinator last year</a> and helped them raise their seed round from General Catalyst, FundersClub, Soma Capital, and others. The founders dropped out during their sophomore year in 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What started with HIPAA quickly expanded. “As our customer base grew, they started asking for support with other frameworks: SOC 2, PCI, GDPR, ISO, basically the whole alphabet soup of compliance,” Kocalar narrated.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Delve\" class=\"wp-image-3029945\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=430,295 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=720,494 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=800,549 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=668,458 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=546,375 546w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=708,486 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">L-R: Selin Kocalar (COO) and Karun Kaushik (CEO) </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Delve</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compliance paperwork can be necessary in everything from launching products to closing enterprise deals. But instead of driving growth, its manual work can become a bottleneck.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Compliance frameworks are standardized. Businesses aren’t,” says CEO Kaushik. “That mismatch is why traditional software breaks down and teams fall back to duct-taped workflows across email, Slack, and shared drives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Delve replaces that busywork with AI agents that run in the background (after integrating with customers’ tools) like internal team members. These agents collect evidence, write reports, update audit logs, and track configuration changes across fragmented systems, automating compliance workflows in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kocalar says compliance is just the wedge into broader back-office operations. Long-term, the AI startup wants to automate a billion hours of other work — eventually expanding into adjacent areas like cybersecurity, risk, and internal governance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insight Partners’ interest reflects this roadmap. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since compliance touches every part of how a business runs, from scaling operations to closing deals to building customer trust, modernizing this function will modernize the entire organization,” said Praveen Akkiraju, managing director at Insight. “That’s what makes Delve’s approach so important.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the startup won’t be without competition. Several AI companies are emerging with agents to automate business workflows. In addition, larger AI labs like OpenAI are releasing general-purpose agents capable of performing complex tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Kocalar says these developments are a validation, not a threat, to Delve’s business. She points to the company’s domain depth in contrast to more general-purpose agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re positioning ourselves to improve as AI advances and labs roll out more sophisticated agentic technologies. But what truly sets us apart is the deep, domain-specific knowledge we’re building into the platform,” she said. “Compliance is always shifting as new regulations emerge and existing ones evolve, with companies interpreting them in different ways. That’s where Delve stands out.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
