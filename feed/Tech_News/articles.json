For the past couple of years, most AI investment has focused on winning over enterprise customers, who provide fat checks, multi-year contracts, and quick paths to scale.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But one VC sees the consumer sector gearing up for a comeback in 2026. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is gonna be the year of the consumer,” said Vanessa Larco, partner at the venture firm Premise and a former partner at NEA, on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/investing-in-the-consumer-ai-products-openai-wont-want-to-kill/\">this week’s episode</a> of the Equity podcast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says that even though enterprises have big budgets and a frantic desire to implement AI solutions, adoption often stalls because “they don’t know where to start,” Larco says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fun thing about consumer and prosumer…is that people already have in mind what they want to use it for,” Larco continued. “And so they purchase it, and if it meets the need, they just keep using it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, adoption is quicker, and startups building AI products don’t have to guess whether they’ve actually achieved product-market fit or have just won a contract. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re selling to consumers, you’ll know very quickly if it’s fitting a need or not, and you’ll know quickly whether you need to pivot or make some changes to your product or totally scrap it and start something totally different,” Larco said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And in today’s anxiety-inducing economy, consumer tech products that manage to scale demonstrate an especially strong product-market fit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are early indications that consumer tech is having a moment. Late last year, OpenAI launched apps in ChatGPT, allowing users to shop with the Target app, scour the housing market with Zillow, book trips with Expedia, or make a Spotify playlist, all through the ChatGPT chatbot experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is gonna feel like concierge-like services, which will do everything for you that you have in mind,” Larco said. “The question is, which of it should be specialized, and which should be general purpose?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or put differently, as OpenAI works to make ChatGPT the new operating system of the consumer internet, which legacy companies – like Tripadvisor or WebMD – will continue to exist in their own right, and which will get eaten by OpenAI?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Larco does think 2026 is going to be a “gangbuster” year for M&amp;A, she’s interested in investing in startups that “OpenAI isn’t going to want to kill.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI doesn’t manage real-world assets,” she said. “I don’t think they’ll build an Airbnb competitor because I don’t think they’re gonna want to manage homes…I don’t think they’re going to build any of these marketplaces that require real humans because they don’t want to manage the humans.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from which startups can fill the gaps, Larco is watching out for what happens if OpenAI “decides to pull an Apple or Android where they take a 30% cut of all the traffic they send you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Is Airbnb gonna want to play ball with that?” she asked. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Larco predicts new monetization strategies and fresh business models will emerge from the evolved consumer experience online. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-social-has-to-change\"><strong>‘Social has to change’</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While doomscrolling on Instagram about Trump’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Larco noticed something. She had come to the platform to get news on the escalating crisis, but instead she was overwhelmingly flooded with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/technology/nicolas-maduro-ai-images-deepfakes.html\">AI-generated Maduro slop</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While deepfakes have been steadily becoming mainstream on social media, this was one of the first major news events where AI-generated slop muddied the waters of the truth. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At that point, I was like, if I’m just gonna be watching AI-generated videos and photos, I want it to be funny,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says she has been inundated with enough realistic-looking AI videos on social media that she just assumes it’s all AI at this point, and she’s not alone. If we all start to assume that nothing we see on Meta’s platforms or TikTok is real anymore, the question will be, where do you get the real stuff?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says others might fill in the gaps of where to find truthful, non-AI content as platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/reddit-will-tighten-verification-to-keep-out-human-like-ai-bots/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/digg-founder-kevin-rose-on-the-need-for-trusted-social-communities-in-the-ai-era/\">Digg</a> make moves to verify humanity. But for Meta? Maybe it just becomes an entertainment company, a platform for user-generated short films.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we should move on from getting your news from [Meta],” Larco said. “You are just getting funny videos from there. It’s not social media. It’s just gaming and entertainment media.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-some-things-are-better-with-voice-than-a-screen\"><strong>‘Some things are better with voice than a screen’</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047721\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Meta Ray-Ban display</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta / Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/\">Meta acquired AI agent startup Manus</a> last week, many saw it as an enterprise play. Larco thinks it could be a move geared at improving Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a product the VC is a huge fan of because they allow her to answer phone calls, respond to messages, take photos and videos, and ask Meta AI questions, all without having to pull out her phone and navigate a screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says she thinks truly useful voice AI assistants are finally “on the cusp of happening,” fueled by more advanced tech and more robust compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some things are better with voice than a screen,” she said. “And because voice sucked, we needed the screen as a crutch. But I would love to start separating out what things are really better on a screen and what things are just better with audio.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Getting answers to questions her kids ask about what the tallest building is? Definitely voice. Taking out her phone to type in the question now feels “archaic,” Larco said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it’ll be really fun for designers because they finally get to pick and choose what form factor is better for what use cases,” she said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Mobile keyboard maker <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.clicks.tech/\">Clicks Technology</a> last week announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/clicks-debuts-its-own-take-on-the-blackberry-smartphone-plus-a-79-snap-on-mobile-keyboard/\">debut phone</a>, the $499 Communicator, which sports a physical keyboard. The company is also offering a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that fits on any device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES, TechCrunch chatted with Clicks’ chief marketing officer and co-founder, Jeff Gadway, and went hands-on with the latest prototype of the upcoming smartphone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device offers a BlackBerry-like keyboard and messaging-focused touchscreen, and runs Android 16 under the hood, which means the Communicator can run any Android app. The company has partnered with the minimalist launcher, Niagara Launcher, to display apps on the homescreen. Other apps are within easy reach via a scrollable list.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg\" alt=\"a photo showing the Clicks Communicator device, with an orange shell and a red lit-up notification button on the side.\" class=\"wp-image-3081107\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg 5712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0678.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 5712px) 100vw, 5712px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reception for the new devices has been better than expected, Gadway told TechCrunch. Although he declined to share sales numbers, he said that over the past week, the company was making a sale every 6.5 seconds between both devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the prototype we tried was not a fully functional phone, it’s the same size and weight as the device that’s preparing to ship later this year, giving an initial feel for what it would be like to use the Communicator. Onboard storage lands at 256 gigabytes, with expandable microSD storage of up to 2 terabytes of data. The device will also sport a 4000mAh silicon-carbon battery and is currently weighing in around 170 grams (or 6 oz). Underneath the back is where your nano-SIM card will go. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phone also comes with interchangeable back covers that you can pop off to change its look. While not present on the prototype, the cover will have a small notch at the top and then a little finger pick at the bottom.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg\" alt=\"a photo showing TechCrunch holding a green Clicks Communicator device, featuring its red lit-up notification button on the side of the device.\" class=\"wp-image-3081106\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg 5076w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 5076px) 100vw, 5076px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where the device’s light-up side button can help. Called the “Signal Light,” the button can be configured to glow with different colors or patterns when you receive messages from certain people, groups or apps.

This is simply a new view you can toggle in and out of as you please to cut through the noise of your incoming mail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is rolling out the AI Inbox feature to trusted testers before making it more broadly available in the coming months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new AI Overviews in Gmail search, users can now search their inbox using natural language questions to get a quick answer instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080899\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says all of Gmail’s AI features are optional, that it doesn’t use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it’s designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080900\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png 2568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=1200,670 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=1280,715 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=430,240 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=720,402 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=900,503 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=800,447 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=1536,858 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=2048,1144 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=668,373 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=1105,617 1105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=708,395 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It’ll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It’s essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Proofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail’s “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users.

Madrona, DNX Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and strategic angel investors also participated, bringing total funding to $21 million, according to the startup.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Retailers are facing changes in how consumers discover products online, as AI tools, social platforms, and recommendation engines increasingly influence buying decisions before shoppers reach a brand’s website. Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traffic flowing through Spangle’s platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the core of Spangle’s approach is a simple idea: instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle’s AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080991\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spangle</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer’s catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spangle’s software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer’s vice president of performance marketing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one-click checkout company Bolt</a> and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle’s focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spangle’s approach also aligns with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/openai-and-perplexity-are-launching-ai-shopping-assistants-but-competing-startups-arent-sweating-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools</a> such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/openai-upgrades-chatgpt-search-with-shopping-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a> and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said, those changes made it possible to replace incremental fixes with an AI-native commerce system that can adapt instantly as shopping behavior evolves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Spangle has six full-time employees, underscoring how AI tools are allowing startups to scale enterprise software with relatively small teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the fresh funding, Kuruvilla said Spangle plans to invest further in research and development, expand its engineering team, and build out its sales organization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And now, before this robotaxi joins Waymo’s official commercial fleet, it’s getting a new name, the company told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Zeekr RT robotaxi will now be named Ojai (pronounced “oh-hi”) — after the village in the Topatopa Mountains above Los Angeles that is known for its arts community and focus on wellness. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s official explanation, per spokesperson Chris Bonelli, is that the company determined the U.S. public isn’t familiar with the Zeekr brand. That branding may even carry through to the rider experience. Apparently, when customers eventually get into the Ojai, the robotaxi will greet them with an “Oh hi” and their name. Cute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, in the U.S. it might not hurt to ditch the name of a Chinese automaker either. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those unfamiliar, Waymo first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/waymo-partners-with-geely-to-make-electric-avs-for-ride-hail-in-the-us/\">struck a partnership</a> with Geely Holding Group-owned Zeekr in 2021. Waymo showed off a concept of a purpose-built robotaxi the following year at a splashy event in Los Angeles. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/inside-the-waymo-zeekr-robotaxi-bird-spirals-and-layoffs-come-to-nuro/\">prototype</a> was based on a version of Zeekr’s  SEA-M architecture designed for “future mobility products” like robotaxis and logistics vehicles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the prototype didn’t have a steering wheel. But the Ojai one, which was shown off at CES 2026, does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Zeekr RT (now Ojai) has gone through some fine-tuning over the years as it has gone through development and testing in cities like Phoenix and San Francisco. Last year at CES, Waymo gave the robotaxi the now-retired name of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/zeekr-rt-the-robotaxi-built-for-waymo-has-the-tiniest-wipers/\">Zeekr RT</a> and showcased some of its hardware, including 13 cameras, four lidar, six radar, an array of external audio receivers, and the tiniest sensor wipers you’ve ever seen. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That hardware suite is the same. But the paint color has been tweaked, according to the company. Waymo told TechCrunch the paint color, which had a blueish tint, is now more silver. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of these final tweaks have happened ahead of Ojai’s imminent launch into commercial service. Waymo employees, and their family and friends, are now able to hail the Zeekr van in San Francisco and Phoenix — typically one of the last steps before it becomes available to the public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is in the midst of a rapid expansion. The company, which offers a commercial robotaxi service in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, plans to launch in a dozen more cities over the next year. Those cities include Denver, Las Vegas, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/waymo-plans-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-london-in-2026/\">London</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable — ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wednesday’s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn’t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called “Great Minds” that was meant to “explore the intersection of technology and humanity.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like “how many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?” But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is rolling the assistant out to its <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/support/category/ford-app/?srsltid=AfmBOopidMSYEhMEboUFbAYtkVT8RMBrMC3OW1Wf0fLVgvCZmyqYMGgM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">newly revamped Ford app</a> in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn’t specify which models it’s prioritizing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford didn’t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it’s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company’s low-cost “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford is promising more with this next-generation BlueCruise system, including eyes-off driving in 2028.

Indeed, many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young and include college dropouts like Mercor’s founder, Brendan Foody.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bonatsos is also interested in investing in founders who are launching consumer businesses, a sector he views as “underappreciated” in a market saturated with enterprise-focused AI startups.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although General Catalyst has transitioned into what it calls an “<a href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investment and transformation company</a>,” it is continuing to make seed-stage bets.

However, after working with LinkedIn over the past two weeks — and addressing the social network’s concerns — Artisan is now being reinstated. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “Every startup inevitably has some kind of thing that comes back to bite them [from things] that they do early on,” Carmichael-Jack said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Contrary to what the rumors in the viral posts said, LinkedIn did not ban the company because its AI agents were spamming users. LinkedIn did, however, object to the startup using LinkedIn’s name on its website and also alleged that the company was using data brokers who had scraped the site without permission, Carmichael-Jack said. Data scraping is a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#rights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">violation of LinkedIn’s terms of service</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Artisan AI is a graduate of startup accelerator Y Combinator and became one of San Francisco’s buzziest startups via <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its “Stop hiring humans” billboards posted</a> around town. Artisan offers an AI agent it calls Ava that does outbound sales by finding and contacting potential customers. LinkedIn is famously precious turf for outbound marketing salespeople — both human and, increasingly, AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a couple of LinkedIn users seemed to notice <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sidharthrajaram_they-actually-wont-be-coming-into-work-at-activity-7410780466460569601-oQlP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Artisan’s ban about a week ago</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-sdr-artisan-linkedin-ban-debate-what-likely-happened-jakub-mach-dgzwf/?trackingId=llmy04HWQOaxJJ6%2FFPkdgw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posts</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/systemsluke/status/2008887364568178736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tweets</a> about it really picked up steam this week. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Carmichael-Jack explained that LinkedIn’s “enforcement team reached out to us, and they basically restricted our accounts completely, so we disappeared from the platform whilst they were reviewing it, which was not ideal. But it was kind of funny, because once we were restricted, our lead flow suddenly started inching up every day. And I think it’s because, obviously, so many people were posting about it.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a founder who likes a good guerrilla marketing scheme, he joked, “I wish we’d done it on purpose.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The truth was he was shocked to get an email from LinkedIn on Friday evening, December 19, right before the Christmas holiday. Carmichael-Jack described the team handling the ban as helpful and responsive, even if they were also anonymous and only reachable by email. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To appease LinkedIn, Artisan removed all mentions of LinkedIn from its website. It was using the name to compare some of its data features to LinkedIn’s. The CEO also got a crash course in third-party vendor verification, ensuring that his data partners were operating in compliance with LinkedIn’s policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Carmichael-Jack is happy to be back on the Microsoft-owned social network, he downplayed how damaging being booted off would have been, saying very little of the data Artisan uses comes from the site. He’s also about to release a new version of the agent that is more autonomous and can use more channels for contacting prospects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can work around anything. We’re launching dialing as a channel in a few months — outbound calling,” so if the LinkedIn ban could not have been reversed, “it wouldn’t be the end of the world,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, LinkedIn isn’t a direct competitor. It did launch its first AI agent <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/ai/how-we-engineered-linkedins-hiring-assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last year called Hiring Assistant</a>, but it is focused on recruiting. Still, that LinkedIn went nuclear on Artisan could signal that a sales agent could one day be in its pipeline, too. LinkedIn did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In any case, Artisan’s very public banning can be seen as a warning for all agentic players looking for sources of data: Big Tech is watching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Launched last August, the $2.99 per month streaming service offers ad-free access to library content, at a time when rival streamers are raising their prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The opportunity for Howdy was — if you just look at what’s going on in the streaming world with streaming services, they’re getting more expensive. They keep raising prices, and they keep adding larger and larger ad loads,” Wood explained at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES. “And so, the part of the market where it actually started — low-cost and no ads — is gone now. There’s no streaming services that address that portion of the market.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec also suggested that Roku intends to bring Howdy to a broader market than just Roku customers, saying that while it started on Roku, the company “will take it off-platform as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked to clarify offstage if that meant mobile apps, the web, and elsewhere, Wood told TechCrunch the company has not yet said where, specifically, it plans to bring Howdy, but that “we want to distribute it everywhere.”  That seems to suggest that Howdy could be an app that you one day load on any device, large or small. Wood declined to share subscriber numbers with TechCrunch, but said onstage, “I think if I just look at the market, it’s going to be a big streaming service.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won’t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within Health, the AI might reference things you’ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you’re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in <a href=\"https://fidjisimo.substack.com/p/chatgpt-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a> that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the healthcare system has its drawbacks, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/psa-you-shouldnt-upload-your-medical-images-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using AI chatbots for medical advice</a> creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don’t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\">hallucinations</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is “not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And what better place to make a dark comedy than in that place that develops our society at this point?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The show will also star Sarah Goldberg, Zach Galifianakis, Simon Helberg, and Rob Corddry and will take place in a fictional universe where no real company names are involved, nor will high-profile tech figures make cameos. However, the show may still hit some familiar chords. For instance, Helberg’s character is a maladjusted genius, working on an AI therapy app for teenagers, when he himself is something of a recluse, with a teenage daughter he neglects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s loneliness, I think, at the heart of all the characters, and they’re all trying to connect, and they’re trying to connect through technology, which has some pitfalls,” Helberg says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two new clips from the shows were streamed at the event, but recording was not allowed. In one, an enthusiastic Magnussen pitches Galifianakis when encountering him eating at a restaurant. Galifianakis never responds but cuts him off eventually by stabbing him in the hand with his fork. Another clip showed Helberg completely missing an opportunity to relate to his daughter, and instead using her facial expression of annoyance to train his AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The show premieres Sunday, April 12 on AMC and AMC+. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Even if investors are gung-ho, it’s not clear yet whether 2026 will become a better market for IPOs. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/discord-is-discussing-an-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Discord was reportedly in early-stage talks about an IPO</a> back in March of last year. But then came chaos in the U.S. federal government — between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)-inspired budget cuts and the end-of-year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/navan-plows-ahead-with-ipo-during-shutdown-aims-for-6-45b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">federal shutdown</a> — scaring off <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/navan-ipo-tumbles-20-after-historic-debut-under-sec-shutdown-workaround/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IPO hopefuls</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the current stock market rally continues and encourages late-stage startups to go public, Discord’s IPO could be one of the biggest of the year. Discord was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/02/is-discord-really-worth-32-less-today-than-it-was-last-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last valued at $14.7 billion</a> in a 2021 funding round in which it raised $500 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The chat app, originally made popular by gamers, now claims more than <a href=\"https://discord.com/company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">200 million monthly active users</a>.

Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules at a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper, and the calendar updates with the new events.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080785\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sarah Perez</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also trying to address other pain points for families, such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery.
