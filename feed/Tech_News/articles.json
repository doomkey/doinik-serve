This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-ai-has-nearly-500-million-users/\">reported </a>nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/chatgpts-user-growth-has-slowed-report-finds/\">810 million MAUs</a> in late 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google recently rolled out a more affordable plan, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/googles-ai-plus-plan-rolls-out-to-all-markets-including-the-u-s/\">the Google AI Plus</a>, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/google-unveils-ironwood-a-new-ai-accelerator-chip/\">Ironwood</a>, to compete with Nvidia.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum. Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users. Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,” Pichai stated in today’s release.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This week, the platform announced a new tool designed to expand on that mission by helping the world’s WordPress users keep their articles in peak digital health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Archive’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/google-and-the-internet-archive-are-the-first-customers-to-pay-for-commercial-access-to-wikipedia-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wayback Machine</a>, which indexes the web through widespread snapshotting, has partnered with Automattic, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/wordpress-maker-automattic-lays-off-16-of-staff/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">company behind WordPress</a>. Together, the two organizations have launched a new WordPress plug-in — the Link Fixer — that is designed to combat the scourge of “link rot.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Link rot” is the unfortunate phenomenon whereby online articles become populated by broken links — URLs that once led to active pages but now result in error messages or dead ends. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pew Research study</a> from 2024 showed that nearly 40% of links that existed in 2013 were no longer active. Such “digital decay” occurs across a broad diversity of web pages, from news and government sites to Wikipedia pages to tweets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automattic <a href=\"https://automattic.com/2026/02/04/wayback-machine-wordpress-link-fixer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">says that</a> its new plug-in works by scanning your WordPress posts for outbound links, then cross-referencing the Wayback Machine for archived versions of those links. If there are none, it will automatically take new snapshots of the articles in question. Should a linked web page go offline, the new feature will then redirect readers to the archived versions, so that there is no drop in service. The tool also archives a user’s own posts, helping to ensure their longevity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool is designed to keep a site’s visitors reading the best available version of a web page. Indeed, Automattic’s plug-in perpetually checks a web page’s links, and if an original link that had gone offline is resurrected, the plug-in will start redirecting the user to that original page again instead of the archived version.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://github.com/a8cteam51/internet-archive-wayback-machine-link-fixer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">write-up on Github</a> shows that the plug-in’s controls are relatively easy to maneuver and offer convenient customization. For instance, users can specify how often they want the plug-in to scan a link for validity (the default offered by the program is every three days).</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The department will be run by a chief of police elected by the city’s commission, and is expected to hire eight officers, according to local news outlet <a href=\"https://www.valleycentral.com/news/local-news/starbase-takes-policing-into-its-own-hands-with-new-department/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Valley Central</a>. It could be up and running in a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is a lot of assets here with the operations of SpaceX,” Starbase city administrator Kent Myers told the outlet. “Those assets need to be protected, and so the police department will play a critical part in protecting those assets.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if Starbase has submitted its application to the TCOLE yet. The city and the TCOLE did not respond to requests for comment. Starbase reportedly hired security consulting firm Vision Quest Solutions to build out the department.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase is where SpaceX makes and tests its prototype Starship rocket. The city is small — it is currently home to just a few hundred residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees (or family of those workers). But it is geographically isolated. The closest neighboring town is Brownsville, which is about 10 miles away, though the drive can take 45 minutes or longer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A police department would be the latest addition to public services that have become available in Starbase since it was incorporated <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/04/residents-of-spacexs-starbase-launch-site-vote-to-incorporate-as-a-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as a city last year</a>. In October, a handful of SpaceX employees who live at Starbase <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/at-starbase-spacex-is-taking-firefighting-into-its-own-hands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">started a volunteer fire department</a>. The city also created a fire marshal position and took on its own building inspections and permitting around that same time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase initially tried to handle law enforcement within its city limits by contracting with the Cameron County sheriff’s office. The city <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/starbase-hires-cameron-county-to-police-its-streets-and-jail-its-offenders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">struck a $3.5 million, five-year contract</a> with the sheriff’s office that was supposed to see two deputies patrol the city at a time, with eight deputies overall assigned to the detail. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase also struck an agreement last year with the sheriff’s office to use the county’s jail. The company town agreed to pay $100 per day per inmate and to reimburse any additional expenses, like medical care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal apparently has not worked out, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We didn’t have a lot of success in finding deputies through the county, so we decided to change direction,” Myers told Valley Central. That was apparently due in part to the contract not having civil service protections, Sheriff Manuel Treviño told the outlet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The relatively new mobile app from the startup <a href=\"https://atmasciences.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Atma Sciences</a> lets anyone create experiences using text, photos, sound, and touch, which are then displayed in a vertical feed, similar to TikTok or Reels. But unlike traditional short-form video apps, you don’t just watch and scroll in Gizmo — you play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Depending on the type of “Gizmo” you encounter, you might poke the screen, swipe, tap, draw, drag, and more to interact with the mini app. These Gizmos aren’t just games but are more like digital toys — things that could include interactive puzzles, memes, art, animation, or anything else a creator can dream up.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089592\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg 2346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=680,363 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=1200,641 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=1280,684 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=430,230 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=720,385 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=900,481 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=800,428 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=1536,821 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=2048,1095 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=668,357 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=1154,617 1154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=708,378 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Gizmo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is an engaging, playful feed, where you can like and comment on the tiny creations and even remix existing Gizmos to create your own version, if you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, you don’t need to know how to code or even vibe code to get started. Instead, you can simply type out an AI prompt to explain your idea using natural language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app then leverages AI coding technology to turn your idea into an interactive experience by generating the code that makes it work. As part of this process, Gizmo will also render your idea visually to ensure that each app functions properly and runs smoothly. Apps are also vetted using AI and human moderation to ensure user safety, a company <a href=\"https://gizmo.party/support/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FAQ</a> notes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gizmo hails from a New York-based startup called <a href=\"https://atmasciences.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Atma Sciences</a>, co-founded by Rudd Fawcett and Brandon Francis, along with CEO Josh Siegel and CTO Daniel Amitay. The company last year raised a $5.49 million seed round from First Round Capital and others, according to data from <a href=\"http://pitchbook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PitchBook</a>. On the company’s website (which is also silly and interactive), the team explains their focus is on combining “powerful technology with simple, elegant foundations,” starting with their creativity app, Gizmo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of the company’s founders responded to requests for an interview when TechCrunch reached out through multiple emails, requests to investors, and via LinkedIn. We were told by one investor that the team isn’t yet ready to do press. (Sorry!)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch was drawn to Gizmo because of the app’s potential for growth and its unique approach to the vibe-coding space (and a rare recommendation from my teen). The company is envisioning a world where anyone can create apps for fun, not just for a purpose, as with other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/the-rise-of-micro-apps-non-developers-are-writing-apps-instead-of-buying-them/\">vibe-coding app platforms for micro apps</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/vibe-coding-startup-anything-nabs-a-100m-valuation-after-hitting-2m-arr-in-its-first-two-weeks/\">like Anything</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite being relatively new, Gizmo’s feed isn’t repetitive. It’s filled with creative mini apps, leading to an experience that feels somewhat like a mash-up between TikTok and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/rooms-an-interactive-3d-space-designer-and-cozy-game-arrives-on-the-app-store/\">interactive 3D-space designer</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/google-puts-1m-into-3d-design-app-rooms-after-more-than-1-million-rooms-created/\">Rooms</a>. But while Rooms introduced the programming language Lua to those who wanted more advanced controls over their creations, Gizmo keeps things prompt-based and simple.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app is incredibly easy to use. You simply type out your prompt and then see how it turns out, and then modify as needed. In one test, the AI quickly coded a mini quiz, but we had to instruct it to edit the title, which was cut off at the top of the screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The resulting creation can be shared to the app’s feed, messaged to a friend, or posted to social media using a unique URL.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to data from market intelligence firm Appfigures, Gizmo has roughly 600,000 installs, with around half coming from the U.S., after being <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/atmasciences_meet-gizmo-a-new-way-to-make-playful-personal-activity-7363303961639964672-NB9U?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAABfl0AB-pFcSfrJ_NE6Dz-ocSptWS4YoW4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced</a> with little fanfare less than six months ago. Around 235,000 of its downloads came in December alone, representing 39% of its total count.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gizmo’s growth from October to December was 312%, with December installs up 50% month-over-month and November installs up 180% from October. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app is available on both <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmo-make-gizmos/id6740640581\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atmasciences.gizmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Android</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Amazon will begin a closed beta program in March, inviting industry partners to try out its AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon said it anticipates sharing initial outcomes from the program by May. The company chose not to provide further details on the developments when approached by TechCrunch for a comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Studio is collaborating with notable producers like Robert Stromberg, known for “Maleficent,” Kunal Nayyar from “The Big Bang Theory,” and former animator Colin Brady from Pixar to learn the best way to implement these tools. Amazon is also tapping Amazon Web Services for support and intends to work with several LLM providers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Albert Cheng, who heads the AI Studios initiative, emphasized that the goal is to support creative teams, not to replace them. The focus is on improving efficiency and reducing costs while ensuring that intellectual property is protected and AI-generated content isn’t absorbed into other AI models. One example used is Amazon’s “House of David” series, which featured <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/house-of-david-season-2-showrunner-pro-ai-shots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">350 AI-generated shots</a> in season two. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​However, the rise of adoption of AI in Hollywood has stirred up plenty of debate. Many people in the industry worry about what it means for jobs, creativity, and the future of filmmaking. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conversations around AI are only getting louder as more companies experiment with these new tools. For instance, Netflix has also jumped on the AI bandwagon, with co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealing that its series “The Eternaut” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/netflix-starts-using-genai-in-its-shows-and-films/\">used generative AI </a>to create a building collapse scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In recent years, Amazon has cited its success with AI as a factor in layoffs. The company recently eliminated <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/amazon-says-it-is-laying-off-16000-employees/\">16,000 jobs</a> in January, following <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/amazon-to-cut-14000-corporate-jobs/\">14,000 layoffs</a> last October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Match said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity, and trust. To do so, the company said it is redesigning discovery to make it less repetitive and is using other features, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/tinder-will-require-new-users-in-the-us-to-verify-their-identity-with-a-selfie/\">Face Check </a>— a facial recognition verification system — to cut down on bad actors. On Tinder, the latter led to a more than 50% reduction in interactions with bad actors, Match noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder’s decision to start moving away from the swipe toward more targeted, AI-powered recommendations could have a significant impact on the dating app. Today, the swipe method, which was popularized by Tinder, encourages users to think that they’re choosing a match from an endless number of profiles. But in reality, the app presents the illusion of choice, since matches have to be two-way to connect, and even then, a spark is not guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company delivered an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/match-group-mtch-q4-2025-earnings-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings beat</a> in the fourth quarter, with revenue of $878 million and EPS of 83 cents per share, above Wall Street estimates. But weak guidance saw the stock decline on Tuesday, before <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/tinder-parent-match-group-s-stock-rises-7-premarket-what-s-making-traders-swipe-right/ar-AA1VDihR?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rising again</a> in premarket trading on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond AI, Match will also increase its product marketing to help boost Tinder engagement. The company is committing to $50 million in Tinder marketing spend, which will include creator campaigns on TikTok and Instagram, where users will make claims that “Tinder is cool again,” Rascoff noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The six-year-old company, which builds battery packs for homeowners in California, Georgia, and Washington, said Wednesday it has completed two large funding rounds.

The Series C was led by Activate Capital, while the Series D was led by B Capital and Prelude Ventures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup plans to use the funds to scale manufacturing to 20,000 units by the end of this year before ramping up to 100,000 by the end of 2028. In total, Lunar has raised more than $500 million from investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stationary storage has become a bright spot for battery manufacturers that have been subject to policy whiplash after the Trump administration and GOP-controlled Congress <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/final-gop-bill-kneecaps-renewables-and-hydrogen-but-lifts-nuclear-and-geothermal/\">gutted large parts of the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which had incentivized companies to build batteries in the U.S. to supply the automotive industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the grid strains under the weight of an increasingly electrified economy — along with the boom in data center demand — grid-connected batteries have become one of the most versatile ways to boost its resiliency. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lunar can call on its fleet of batteries, which come in 5 kilowatt-hour modules between 15 kilowatt-hours and 30 kilowatt-hours, to deliver juice to the grid when needed. Its virtual power plant (VPP) software can also control EV chargers and appliances, allowing it to both supply electrons while tamping down demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such VPPs are <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/turing-test-inspired-tool-compares-virtual-power-plants-to-gas-peakers/808162/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expected</a> to be able to replace costly and polluting peaking power plants in a matter of years.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Competition in the space has been heating up lately. In October, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/base-power-raises-1b-to-deploy-home-batteries-everywhere/\">Base Power raised $1 billion</a>, less than six months after raising a $200 million round for its residential battery-based VPP.

The company claims the tool, called Cube 3D, has so far helped users generate over 1.8 million 3D objects since it was rolled out last March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, the company <a href=\"https://about.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/02/accelerating-creation-powered-roblox-cube-foundation-model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched the open beta </a>for its anticipated 4D creation feature that lets creators make not just static 3D models, but fully functional and interactive objects. The feature has been in <a href=\"https://devforum.roblox.com/t/early-access-introducing-in-experience-4d-functional-objects-and-enhanced-3d-generation/4050893/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">early access</a> since November. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox says 4D creation adds an important new layer: interactivity. With this technology, users can design items that can move and react to players in the game.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Roblox-4D-Creations.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3088899\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​At launch, there are two types of object templates (called schemas) that creators can try out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first is the “Car-5” schema, which is used to create a car made of five separate parts: the main body and four wheels. Previously, cars were a single, solid 3D object that couldn’t move. The new system breaks down objects into parts and assigns behaviors to each so that they function individually within the virtual world. The AI therefore can generate cars with spinning wheels, making them more realistic and interactive. ​</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second is called “Body-1,” which can generate any object made from a single piece, like a simple box or sculpture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first experience with 4D generation is a game called <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/113627622022152/Wish-Master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wish Master</a>, where players can generate cars they can drive, planes they can fly, and even dragons.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​In the future, Roblox plans to let creators make their own schemas so they’ll have more freedom to define how objects behave. The company says it is also developing new technology that could use a reference image to create a detailed 3D model that matches the image’s style (example below).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3088898\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=768,330 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=680,292 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=430,185 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=720,310 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=900,387 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=800,344 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=668,287 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=708,304 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upsample-3D-Models.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says it is developing more ways to help people create games and experiences using AI, including a project it has dubbed “real-time dreaming.” Roblox CEO David Baszucki last month <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Rghjjk4h_kw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">explained</a> that this project would let creators build new worlds using “keyboard navigation and sharing real-time text prompts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The open beta comes on the heels of Roblox’s recent implementation of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/roblox-now-requires-all-users-globally-to-complete-age-checks-to-access-chat/\">mandatory facial verification</a> for users to access chat features in the game, following lawsuits and investigations related to child safety.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Sequoia partner Andrew Reed is joining the company’s board.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is now valued at $11 billion, more than three times its valuation in <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/announcing-an-employee-tender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its last round in January 2025</a>. Earlier in the year, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bb87485-7641-4577-8b64-144a1553d42e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Financial Times</a> reported that the startup was looking to raise at that valuation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that existing investor a16z quadrupled its investment amount, and Iconiq, which led the last round, tripled it. Some prior investors, like BroadLight, NFDG, Valor Capital, AMP Coalition, and Smash Capital, also joined the round. New investors for the funding included Lightspeed Venture Partners, Evantic<br>Capital, and Bond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ElevenLabs said that it will disclose some investors later in February, which might be strategic partners. The company has raised over $781 million to date. It said that it will use the funding for research and product development, along with expansion in international markets like India, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, and Mexico. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s co-founder, Mati Staniszewski, indicated that ElevenLabs might work on agents beyond voice and incorporate video. In January, the company announced <a href=\"https://ltx.studio/blog/ltx-audio-to-video-generation-with-elevenlabs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a partnership with LTX to produce audio-to-video content</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The intersection of models and products is critical – and our team has proven, time and again, how to translate research into real-world experiences. This funding helps us go beyond voice alone to transform how we interact with technology altogether. We plan to expand our Creative offering – helping creators combine our best-in-class audio with video and Agents – enabling businesses to build agents that can talk, type, and take action,” he said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has seen good growth momentum as it closed the year at $330 million ARR. In an interview with <a href=\"https://x.com/elevenlabsio/status/2010777303572242480?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> earlier this year, Staniszewski said that it took ElevenLabs five months to reach $200 million to $300 million in ARR.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Voice AI model providers are an attractive target for investors and big tech companies. In January, rival Deepgram raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/deepgram-raises-130m-at-1-3b-valuation-and-buys-a-yc-ai-startup/\">$130 million from AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation</a>. Meanwhile, Google hired <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/google-reportedly-snags-up-team-behind-ai-voice-startup-hume-ai/\">top talent from voice model company Hume AI</a>, including CEO Alan Cowen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This applies to individual, small business, and enterprise customers.  Maintenance mode means we will continue to support the application and provide ongoing security and bug fixes, but we are no longer adding new features. Animate will continue to be available for both new and existing users - we will not be discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate,” it said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One customer, <a href=\"https://x.com/TylerGlaiel/status/2018394595340771653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posting on X</a>, had asked Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things <a href=\"https://x.com/ThisIsWronchi/status/2018404802510630914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like</a>, “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” <a href=\"https://x.com/Ari4472/status/2018406974589722819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and</a>, “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, the company updated its support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing that Adobe Animate would be discontinued on March 1, 2026. Enterprise customers would continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition, the company said at the time. Other customers would have support through March of next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/animate/kb/end-of-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FAQ</a>, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reading between the lines, it seemed as if Adobe was saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s surprising is that Adobe couldn’t even recommend software that would fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it said customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, it suggested that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction when no mention was made of Animate at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before switching to “maintenance mode,” Abode had intended for the software to continue to work for those who have it downloaded. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. Now, the company says it will be available to new users, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some users have been recommending other animation programs to use as a replacement, including <a href=\"https://moho.lostmarble.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Moho Animation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.toonboom.com/products/harmony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Toon Boom Harmony.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated, February 4, 2026, to note that Adobe reversed its decision and announced the software would be placed in maintenance mode instead of discontinued. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He often posts about the company’s autonomous ride-hailing efforts, and has a board seat at AV company Waabi — so the appointment may be a signal of the company’s plans to expand its driverless investments and operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Krishnamurthy <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/407969754/files/doc_earnings/2025/q4/transcript/Uber-Q4-25-Prepared-Remarks.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> the company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With large and growing free cash flows, over the coming years we will invest with discipline across a multitude of opportunities, including positioning Uber to win in an AV future,” Krishnamurthy wrote in a <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/fcda6930-c9b5-4ab5-bb64-9b621c2ca8a5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a> detailing the company’s Q4 results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on the call that he was convinced autonomous vehicles would “unlock a multitrillion-dollar opportunity,” for the company, adding that autonomy “fundamentally amplifies” the strengths of the company’s platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By the end of 2026, we expect to be facilitating AV trips in as many as 15 cities globally, with a roughly even split of U.S. and international cities. And by 2029, we intend to be the largest facilitator of AV trips in the world,” Khosrowshahi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past two years, Uber has amassed partnerships with at least 20 autonomous vehicle companies across a variety of use cases, including sidewalk delivery robots, robotaxis, and trucking. Waymo is perhaps its highest profile partner with shared robotaxi operations in Atlanta and Austin.

The duo decided to break out on their own and, earlier this year, launched their firm to back digital marketplaces. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It felt like the timing was right and there was support within the firm to go do this,” Nagar said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vision is that there is still so much to digitize, like in supply chain and construction, and this is the moment to strike because even holdout industries are more comfortable adopting new technology as fintech architecture advances. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you look at the biggest venture wins over the last decade,” she said, pointing to the likes of Uber, Instacart, and Airbnb, “those are five of the top 10 outcomes in venture.” As in those companies that raised billions from investors, went on to IPO, and returned millions to them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of those wins were in consumer, which tends to be faster-moving than large enterprises,” Nagar continued. “We think there’s a ton of white space to double down and focus on B2B marketplaces.” Looking specifically for the categories that haven’t yet digitized. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm has already invested in six companies, including Big Rentals and Repackify, focused on equipment rental and packaging logistics, respectively. Nagar said the firm hopes to overall write seed checks into at least 20 companies, at $1 million to $2 million a pop. She said they hope to deploy the entire fund within the next 3 to 4 years. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though many new funds are struggling to raise capital (and capital remains concentrated at the top), Nagar said she and Koopersmith were able to lean on their backgrounds when wooing LPs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nagar previously helped launch Amazon apparel back in 2009, and was head of mobile at RetailMeNot. Koopersmith, meanwhile, spent 20 years at Pritzker Group and serves on the board of various marketplace companies. At the same time, Nagar said that without Pritzker’s support, it would have been quite hard to raise this fund, especially in last year’s environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other LPs in their fund include the State of Illinois Growth and Innovation Fund and executives from other marketplace companies, like Favor Delivery and RetailMeNot. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nagar said the firm is also location-agnostic, recognizing that the still-hidden marketplaces may not be found only in Silicon Valley and New York City. “We’re finding these overlooked founders in places where maybe other funds aren’t looking,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SNAK is itself based in Chicago, which she said some LPs have questioned. “People perceive that as a disadvantage; we view it as an advantage,” she continued. “We can get to everybody very fast.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said that the AI feature will be free to Prime members across devices. Meanwhile, anyone can use Alexa+ for free <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/alexa-without-an-echo-amazons-ai-chatbot-comes-to-the-web-and-a-revamped-alexa-app/\">via the Alexa website</a> or mobile app, with some limitations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have tens of millions of customers using Alexa+ now, and now we’re going to make it available to all Prime members…Prime members enjoy unlimited access — it’s basically a paid-tier level of access that we’re including in Prime now,” notes Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/amazon-unveils-a-new-and-improved-alexa-alexa/\">last year</a>, Alexa+ is model agnostic — meaning it runs on a combination of Amazon’s own foundation models and those from other companies, allowing the assistant to do more than the basic tasks of its predecessor using whatever AI technology is best for the job. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034655\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/alexa-devices.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an AI assistant, Alexa+ can carry on natural language conversations that include follow-up questions and back-and-forth chat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to performing smart home tasks, scheduling timers, or offering news and weather, as before, the new assistant can do most things that other AI chatbots can do — like planning an itinerary for a trip, updating a shared calendar, finding and saving recipes to a library, making movie recommendations, helping with homework, exploring a topic, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/amazons-ai-assistant-alexa-now-works-with-angi-expedia-square-and-yelp/\">integrations</a> with services like Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, Uber, Angi, Expedia, Square, Yelp, Fodor’s, OpenTable, and Suno will allow Alexa to perform more complex tasks, like scheduling a dinner reservation or requesting an Uber ride. Amazon has not yet shared user adoption numbers on this more “agentic” use case (where the AI acts autonomously to complete tasks) for the AI helper.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During its year-long beta testing period, Alexa customers had the option to try the AI feature or roll back to the prior version. The company tells TechCrunch the option to revert to the old Alexa will continue to be available, but couldn’t say for how long. Likely, Amazon wants a bit more time to improve the AI experience before making it a requirement for users. The percentage of those opting out is also a key metric to track, but Rausch notes that the figure is in the low single digits, suggesting that most customers are not so unhappy with Alexa+ that they’re giving up. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?w=680\" alt=\"Alexa.com\" class=\"wp-image-3079553\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Amazon has had to work to resolve bugs and address user feedback ahead of this launch. Some beta testers complained that Alexa+ was too chatty, or interrupted at the wrong times, for instance. Others complained about Alexa’s new voice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon has taken in this feedback and made changes over time. For instance, the company revised the onboarding experience to have Alexa explain how to change her voice, as some preferred Alexa’s “OG” voice. (That voice is still available as Alexa+ voice No. 2, but it now uses AI to add more inflection.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Eventually, we had her use her new version of her old voice, and then switch back again, just to show customers,” says Rausch, describing the changes the team made to onboarding. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another example, Amazon tried to make Alexa less prone to unwanted interruptions. Now, Alexa will ask, “Is that for me?” when the AI is unsure who is being addressed. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?w=335\" alt=\"Alexa app\" class=\"wp-image-3079554\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=768,1560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=591,1200 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=630,1280 630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=212,430 212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=354,720 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=443,900 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=394,800 394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=756,1536 756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=1008,2048 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=329,668 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=185,375 185w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=304,617 304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=261,531 261w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot of the new Alexa app</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rausch points out that the overall experience is configurable, too. If customers don’t want the follow-on mode, for instance — which allows Alexa to continue listening after responding — they can turn it off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked if users will be able to change the AI assistant’s personality, as in other AI chatbots, where the AI can be set to be personal, professional, quirky, nerdy, and more,  Rausch says simply, “Stay tuned.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the beta, Amazon reported positive adoption trends in terms of both usage and engagement, with few customers opting for rollbacks. Music streams increased by 25% after customers upgraded to Alexa+, and more customers are engaging deeply with recipes, a feature that has seen 5x growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, customers are having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+, compared with the original Alexa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Alexa+ will be free to U.S. Prime members, non-Prime customers could opt to pay $19.99/month for standalone access — a price that’s comparable to something like ChatGPT Plus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon notes the free experience on web and mobile will have some limits, but these are mainly in place to protect against abuse. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’ve got some great, generous limits. We’re not talking about exactly what they are today, but…there are some [limits],” Rausch says. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Alexa+ experience in the U.S. will be available across Alexa devices, including Echo products, Fire TV, Alexa.com, the Alexa mobile app, and Alexa-enabled devices from partners including Samsung, Bose, and others, with more to come. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We’ve gathered a large quantity of data on the oceans from satellites, but most of that is based on the top layer of water. Below that, the picture gets murkier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Buoys, ships, and some autonomous rovers have <a href=\"https://research.noaa.gov/noaa-collects-a-lot-of-data-on-the-ocean-here-are-4-ways-we-use-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently added</a> some detail, but it’s nothing like what we get from satellites today. It’s frustrating to everyone from fishermen to the Coast Guard, meteorologists to offshore wind developers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Getting data from the subsurface ocean has always been really hard,” Ravi Pappu, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.apeironlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apeiron Labs</a>, told TechCrunch. “It’s really slow. You need a ship that costs $100,000 a day, [and] steams out slowly. Everything’s an expedition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pappu hopes that his bobbing, autonomous underwater vehicle can change that. He founded Apeiron Labs in 2022 after a stint as CTO of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. There, the lack of data on the ocean was “a persistent problem” that kept coming up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To fill the gaps, Apeiron Labs is building low-cost vehicles that travel 400 meters up and down the water column (the vertical section of ocean from surface to seafloor), sampling temperature, salinity, and acoustics once or twice per day. Apeiron currently sells to both civilian and defense customers, Pappu said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To build and sell more of its autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), Apeiron Labs recently closed a $9.5 million Series A round led by Dyne Ventures, RA Capital Management Planetary Health, and S2G Investments, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Assembly Ventures, Bay Bridge Ventures, and TFX Capital participated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At three feet long, five inches in diameter, and just over 20 pounds, the startup’s AUVs can be deployed from boats or airplanes. Not coincidentally, they also fit into the U.S. Navy’s existing launch equipment. Once the AUV hits the water, it gets its bearings and connects to a cloud-based operating system, where it logs its data. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it dives, the operating system uses models of the ocean to predict where it will surface. When the AUV finally breaches and reconnects with the operating system, the cloud-based software incorporates the new data to refine its models. The AUVs are spaced about 10 km to 20 km apart (6.2 miles to 12.4 miles), forming a line or array that captures data in greater resolution than ship-based efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apeiron envisions deploying dozens or hundreds of its AUVs for a range of customers. The Pentagon might use them to listen for submarines off the coast of the U.S., while fisheries might want to receive more detailed temperature and salinity data about prime fishing waters. The goal is persistent monitoring in key parts of the ocean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pappu said that at Apeiron’s current scale, it has brought the cost of ocean data down by 100-fold. He wants to get it down by a factor of 1,000, and he thinks Apeiron can hit that target next year. Referencing a type of small, low-cost satellite, Pappu adds: “We think of ourselves as the CubeSat for the ocean.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update 10 a.m. ET: The headline has been updated to reflect that Apeiron raised $9.5 million, not $29 million.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The fresh funding also included participation from WillowTree Ventures and MVP Ventures, alongside Fortune 100 operators joining as angel investors and advisors, bringing the startup’s total funding to $7.5 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For large companies, the gap between increasingly personalized ads and largely generic website experiences has traditionally been filled by a mix of personalization software, engineering teams, and marketing agencies — a model that is slow, expensive, and difficult to scale. While ads can be tailored instantly for different audiences, changing what happens once a visitor lands on a site often requires weeks of coordination and limits teams to running only a handful of experiments each year. Fibr AI argues that this human-heavy operating model no longer works. Instead, the startup uses autonomous AI agents to infer intent, generate variations, and continuously optimize pages in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fibr AI replaces the agency- and engineering-heavy model with autonomous systems that operate continuously, Ankur Goyal (pictured above, right), the co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are [the] software, and the agency is the workforce of agents we are deploying,” Goyal told TechCrunch, adding that this allows Fibr AI to run thousands of experiments in parallel rather than a few dozen each year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adoption was initially slow. Founded in early 2023 by Goyal and Pritam Roy (pictured above, left), Fibr AI had just one or two customers for much of its first two years as enterprises took time to evaluate the approach. That began to change last year, Goyal said, with adoption picking up among large U.S. companies, including banks and healthcare providers, bringing the total number of customers to 12.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are an infra afterthought layer,” Goyal told TechCrunch. “Once it’s set up, nobody wants to think about it again.” That dynamic, he added, has led Fibr AI to sign three- to five-year contracts with large enterprises, which tend to treat website infrastructure as something to standardize rather than continuously revisit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At a technical level, Fibr AI operates as a layer on top of an existing website, connecting to a company’s advertising, analytics, and customer data systems to understand how visitors arrive and what they are likely looking for. Its AI agents then assemble and adjust page content, such as copy, imagery, and layout, treating each URL as a system that learns and optimizes continuously rather than a fixed page. Instead of relying on manually configured rules or sequential A/B tests, the platform runs large numbers of micro-experiments in parallel and updates experiences systematically as traffic flows in from different channels.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089322\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-personalization_b82c81.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Fibr AI personalizes webpages using AI agents</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Fibr AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift has direct cost implications for large enterprises. Traditional website personalization typically combines software licenses with agency retainers and engineering time, tying costs to people rather than outcomes. Goyal said enterprises are increasingly evaluating Fibr AI’s platform based on cost per experiment and conversion impact, rather than the number of tools or people involved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Accel, that operating model — rather than the AI buzz — was central to the decision to invest again. “Advertising today is one-to-one, but when users land on a website it becomes one-to-many,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel. “You can create hundreds of ads for different audiences, but they all still land on the same page.” Fibr’s ability to turn that dynamic into one-to-one personalization, he said, stood out because it removed the agency and engineering bottlenecks that typically limit how far enterprises can push experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop added that early enterprise adoption, particularly among banks and healthcare companies, helped validate the thesis. “These are regulated, conservative industries,” he said. “When they start saying, ‘We need this, and we’re willing to pay for it,’ that’s when we feel confident doubling down.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-future-proofing-for-the-agentic-commerce-era\">Future-proofing for the agentic-commerce era</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While most of Fibr AI’s business today is driven by personalizing experiences for human visitors, Accel and Fibr AI also see potential in how AI agents are beginning to mediate online discovery. As users increasingly research, compare, and shortlist products using large language models and AI chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, before visiting a website, Swaroop said, the ability for sites to adapt based on what a visitor — or an AI system acting on their behalf — already knows could become more important over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That part is still early,” Swaroop said, “but the companies building for today’s needs while being ready for that shift tomorrow are the ones we want to back.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089266\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg 1298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=768,582 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=680,516 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=1200,910 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=1280,970 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=430,326 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=720,546 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=900,682 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=800,606 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=668,506 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=495,375 495w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=814,617 814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=700,531 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fibr-ai-llm-optimization.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1298px) 100vw, 1298px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Fibr AI’s dynamic experience for discovery through LLMs and AI chatbots</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Fibr AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new funding, Fibr AI plans to focus on expanding its sales and customer-facing teams in the U.S., while continuing to build out its technical base in India. The San Francisco-headquartered startup maintains an office in Bengaluru, with 17 of its roughly 23 employees based in India and the remaining six in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Goyal said the startup targets about $5 million in annual recurring revenue by the end of this year and around 50 enterprise customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fibr AI is entering a space long dominated by incumbents such as Adobe and Optimizely, which offer experimentation and personalization tools to large enterprises. But both Goyal and Swaroop argued that those platforms are constrained by how they are built and sold, typically relying on marketing agencies and engineering teams to configure and operate them. That model, they said, makes it difficult to move quickly or scale experimentation, even as customer acquisition and messaging have become increasingly dynamic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Incumbents have been slow in bringing out products,” Swaroop said, adding that even when new features arrive, they often come years after demand has shifted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Spotify says it chose to move lyrics to this more prominent position after user tests suggested it increased engagement with the feature. (It’s still possible to share favorite lyrics snippets to social media from the Now Playing View, the company noted.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This feature, which Spotify called lyric previews, will roll out globally to both free and paid customers on the iOS and Android apps for smartphones and tablets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, lyrics translations, which were first introduced in 2022, will now be globally available. That’s an expansion from the 25 markets supported last year. When translations are available, you can tap the translate icon on the lyrics card to see the translation appear beneath the original lyrics. The translation will default to whatever your device’s language is set to, Spotify says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In past years, Spotify had been slow to roll out lyrics across its app, largely due to licensing issues. After years of consumer demand for the feature, the company finally rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/\">real-time lyrics to global users </a>in 2021 after a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/in-a-significant-expansion-spotify-to-launch-real-time-lyrics-in-26-markets/\">smaller launch</a> in a couple of dozen markets the year prior, and tests that spanned back to 2019. Before this, Spotify had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/12/spotify-teams-with-genius-to-annotate-music-tracks/\">partnered</a> with Genius for a “behind the lyrics” feature, which combined partial lyrics with song trivia.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The outfit plans to use the capital to speed up deployment of its high-speed memory chips, a critical component for the chips used for AI workloads, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round, which brought Positron to a $1 billion valuation, was co-led by Arena Private Wealth, Jump Trading, and Unless, with strategic investment from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which has been increasingly focused on building out AI infrastructure, the sources said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Reno-based startup’s Series B comes as hyperscalers and AI firms push to reduce their reliance on longstanding leader Nvidia. These firms include OpenAI, which, despite being one of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers, is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-is-unsatisfied-with-some-nvidia-chips-looking-alternatives-sources-say-2026-02-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> unsatisfied with some of the firm’s latest AI chips and has been seeking alternatives since last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Qatar, through QIA, has been accelerating a broader push into so-called “sovereign” AI infrastructure — a priority repeatedly underscored at Web Summit Qatar in Doha this week. Several sources told TechCrunch the country views compute capacity as critical to staying competitive on the global economic stage, and is positioning itself as a leading AI services hub in the Middle East, fueling interest in startups like Positron.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The strategy is already taking shape through major commitments, including a $20 billion AI infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.qia.qa/en/Newsroom/Pages/Brookfield-and-Qai-Form-$20-Billion-Strategic-Investment-Partnership-for-AI-Infrastructure.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">joint venture with Brookfield Asset Management</a> that was announced in December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Positron’s fundraise brings the three-year-old startup’s total capital raised to just over $300 million. The startup previously raised $75 million last year from investors including Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, DFJ Growth, Flume Ventures, and Resilience Reserve. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims its first-generation chip, Atlas, manufactured in Arizona, can match the performance of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for less than a third of the power. Positron is focused on inference — computing needed to run AI models for real-world applications — rather than training large language models, positioning the company well as demand surges for inference hardware as businesses increasingly shift focus from building large models to deploying them at scale.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the funding, Positron aims to accelerate its roadmap to ship its next-generation Asimov silicon chip, targeting production in early 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources tell TechCrunch that beyond its memory capabilities, Positron’s chips also perform strongly in high-frequency and video-processing workloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Positron for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to include updates from Positron about co-lead investors and valuation. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the date of QIA’s partnership with Brookfield. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
