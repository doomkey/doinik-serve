But before you ever write a line of code, you already have assets: your background, your experiences, your reputation, your network. Most founders simply forget to treat those as strategic tools. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the saying goes, “if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.” Be intentional about who you surround yourself with, build a focused network, and share your unique expertise boldly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=TCML1650088392\">Isabelle sits down with Kyle Rudolph and Jon Walburg</a>, co-founders of <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://alltroo.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=LD%7CBrand&amp;utm_term=alltroo&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=16827576454&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoiJrk-MVaPx7QpV5EqAk-FvOtGXz&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA_8TJBhDNARIsAPX5qxQinNr5titgDXsJ-zIf19o22HbnSkyL5olgAeQphdoCRzfkfCj7gwcaArgnEALw_wcB\">Alltroo</a></strong>, a fundraising platform that transforms celebrity access into once-in-a-lifetime charitable sweepstakes, from swimming with Michael Phelps to Oktoberfest at Arnold Schwarzenegger’s house. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kyle and Jon’s story shows that while celebrity status can open doors, it’s the execution, trust, and authenticity behind the company that keeps those doors open. Their credibility—rooted in Kyle’s career with the Minnesota Vikings, co-founder Jason Zucker’s career with the Buffalo Sabres, Jon’s operator background, and the early crowdfunding success that inspired their model—forms a powerful foundation of founder-market fit that’s hard to copy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their pivot from exclusive $10,000 golf events to accessible $10 sweepstakes demonstrates how democratizing access can actually elevate prestige when done with intention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while not every founder begins with celebrity reach, every founder <em>does</em> begin with a network and the ability to grow influence. The real differentiator is how you activate it: strategically, authentically, and in ways that create clear value. Thought leadership is one of the most effective levers: sharing insights publicly; showing up on social media with purpose; writing, speaking, and consistently putting your ideas into the world. That’s how you become a “celebrity” in your own right, through credibility and contribution. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This episode isn’t about chasing fame. It’s about how Kyle and Jon leverage their community and relationships to build trust, gain early traction, and open doors most founders never think to knock on and how any founder can use the same playbook to drive their go-to-market strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>New episodes of Build Mode drop every Thursday <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pod.link/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vWUZMNjEyNzkzNjQ5NA\">subscribe to the podcast </a>or watch on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TechCrunch/featured\">YouTube</a>.

The startup raised $160 million in the round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This latest capital infusion came just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/four-months-after-a-3b-valuation-harvey-ai-grows-to-5b/\">months after it raised $300 million in a Series E</a> round at a $5 billion valuation in June. And that was just months after raising a Sequoia-led <a href=\"https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harvey-raises-series-d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$300 million Series D</a> at a $3 billion valuation in February.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harvey’s investors include EQT, WndrCo, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Sarah Guo’s Conviction, and Elad Gil. In September, just before raising this latest mega round, Harvey <a href=\"https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harveys-momentum-in-q3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> some details about its business. While it declined to share any absolute numbers, just percentages of growth and retention (it later told TechCrunch that it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue back in August), it said that it counts 50 of the top AmLaw 100 firms as its customers. It also serves corporate legal teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an industry entirely based on words, it makes sense that legal functions would be a perfect use case for LLMs: searching, summarizing, and drafting, all based on domain-specific training. But Harvey is also one of the best examples of how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/vcs-deploy-kingmaking-strategy-to-crown-ai-winners-in-their-infancy/\">VCs are “kingmaking” these days</a>. That involves pouring vast sums of money into a startup to signal how solid it is, which encourages large enterprise customers, like law firms, to sign big contracts in a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that Harvey was founded in 2022, it may be far enough ahead of competitors — both in customer acquisition and the reinforced training from working with so many law firms — that it is the king of this market. At least, one of its long-time VCs, Elad Gil, thinks so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gil told TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/elad-gil-on-which-ai-markets-have-winners-and-which-are-still-wide-open/\">that Harvey is one of the AI market leaders</a> that is experiencing bona fide growth because its tech and market position are “just working.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harvey’s founder and CEO Winston Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/inside-harvey-how-a-first-year-legal-associate-built-one-of-silicon-valleys-hottest-startups/\">an incredible story of how it originally</a> claimed the hearts of Silicon Valley’s powerhouse VCs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all started with a proof of concept about landlord-tenant law and a cold email to Sam Altman. Harvey became one of OpenAI Startup Fund’s first investments. And it’s been a VC darling ever since.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

(Amnesty published screenshots taken from the video, but not the full video.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The nonprofit researchers wrote that the leaked video shows apparent “live” Predator infection attempts “against real targets,” based on detailed information “from at least one infection attempt against a target in Kazakhstan.” The video contained the infection URL, the target’s IP address, and the software versions of the target’s phone.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3072893\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=430,196 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=720,328 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=668,304 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=708,322 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A screenshot of the dashboard of an Intellexa customer surveillance system, which shows the types of sensitive personal data of hacked targets that customers and Intellexa support staff may have access to. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amnesty International</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies that sell spyware to government agencies, such as NSO Group and the now-defunct Hacking Team, have long maintained that they never have access to the data of their customers’ targets, nor their customers’ systems. There are several reasons why. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From the point of view of the spyware makers, they don’t want the potential legal liability if their customers use the spyware unlawfully. And spyware makers would rather say that once they sell their spyware, the customers are fully responsible for using it. From the government customers’ standpoint, they don’t want to expose details of their sensitive investigations, such as targets’ names, locations, and personal data, to a private company that may be based overseas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, this type of remote access is absolutely not “normal,” as Paolo Lezzi, the chief executive of spyware maker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/ceo-of-spyware-maker-memento-labs-confirms-one-of-its-government-customers-was-caught-using-its-malware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Memento Labs</a>, told TechCrunch when contacted for this story to ask from the perspective of a spyware maker. “No [government] agency would accept it,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Lezzi was skeptical that the leaked training video was showing access to an actual customer’s live surveillance system. Perhaps, he posited, this was training material showing a demo environment. The chief executive also said that some customers have asked Memento Labs to have access to their systems, but the company only accepts the offer if it’s necessary to solve technical issues. In any case, he said, “they enable us to have TeamViewer access for the necessary time and under their supervision we carry out the intervention and leave.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Intellexa?

Not only is their most sensitive data exposed to a government or other spyware customer, but their data risks being exposed to a foreign surveillance company, which has demonstrable issues in keeping their confidential data stored securely,” the nonprofit wrote in the report. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intellexa could not be reached for comment. A lawyer speaking on behalf of Intellexa’s founder, Tal Dilian, told Haaretz that Dilian has “not committed any crime nor operated any cyber system in Greece or anywhere else.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dilian is one of the more controversial people in the world of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#spyware-commercial-government\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">government spyware</a>. A veteran of the spyware industry previously told TechCrunch that Dilian “moves like an elephant in a crystal shop,” implying he made little effort to conceal his activities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In that particular space of spyware sellers you have to be extremely balanced and attentive … but he didn’t care,” said the person.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/us-sanctions-founder-of-spyware-maker-intellexa-for-targeting-americans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. government announced sanctions against Tal Dilian</a> and one of his business partner, Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou. In that case, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions based on allegations that Intellexa’s spyware was used against Americans, including U.S. government officials, journalists, and policy experts. The sanctions make it illegal for American companies and nationals to have any commercial relationship with Dilian and Hamou.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was the first time the U.S. government, which has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/\">taken actions against spyware NSO Group</a>, targeted a specific person involved in the industry.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his response to Haaretz, Dilian accused journalists of being “useful idiots” in an “orchestrated campaign” to hurt him and his company, which was “fed into the Biden administration.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Next year, users will be able to send their notes and documents to Alexa+ and have a more involved conversation about them.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3052266\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg 1206w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kindle</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the Colorsoft allows artists to create smooth gradients and subtle tones with a new shader tool.

And while robotaxis have become commonplace in the San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Los Angeles, autonomous trucks are absent because regulations ban any driverless vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds from testing on public roads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agency, which has considered lifting the ban for a couple of years now, released a draft of the proposed changes in 2024. The final proposed revisions were released Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revised regulations cover a few areas beyond self-driving trucks, including language that appears to give law enforcement the power to issue traffic tickets to driverless vehicles — an issue that has received more attention as Waymo has expanded its commercial robotaxi operation in the state. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The self-driving trucks component is by far the most contentious. The revisions reflect feedback received during the initial public comment period this spring, the agency said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proposal was met with enthusiasm by companies developing autonomous vehicle technology, many of which are based in California, but test on highways in other states like Texas. Companies like Aurora Innovation and Kodiak AI eventually want to use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/aurora-expands-self-driving-trucks-route-to-el-paso/\">self-driving trucks to carry freight</a> along commerce-heavy freeways across states. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The California DMV’s latest draft regulations show real progress toward creating a regulatory framework for driverless trucks in the state and unlocking coast-to-coast autonomous operations,” Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, said in an emailed statement. “These proposed regulations are a critical step towards bringing autonomous trucks to California freeways in 2026, a milestone that will enhance road safety and grow the economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Teamsters Union, which has fought to protect truck drivers, is unmoved. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our position remains the same, we are opposed to the deployment and testing of this technology on our roads,” Shane Gusman, the legislative director for Teamsters California, told TechCrunch. “The changes that are made don’t change our position.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gusman noted that the Teamsters will fight the proposed revisions. It’s also lobbying for <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">passage of AB 33</a>, a bill currently on the state Senate floor, which would require a human safety operator behind the wheel of any heavy duty autonomous truck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV’s revised rules would require self-driving truck companies to go through a phased permitting process, mirroring current regulations applied to light-duty autonomous vehicles like robotaxis. Companies would first receive a permit to test with a human safety operator behind the wheel. The DMV issues separate permits for driverless testing and deployment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Manufacturers would be required to conduct testing for a minimum number of miles prior to applying for a driverless testing permit and a deployment permit, under the DMV rules. For instance, self-driving truck companies would need to complete a minimum of 500,000 autonomous test miles — 100,000 of which must occur in the intended operational design domain in California — before it will receive a driverless permit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV also proposed revising rules that would affect light-duty autonomous vehicles. For instance, the regulations would expand the frequency and type of data reported to the department during testing and deployment and require companies to update plans on interacting with first responders on a more regular basis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before she was a VC, Masha Bucher worked in PR and marketing — an experience that has shaped the way she runs Day One Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After years of working in communications — including executive roles that gave her deep insight into how startups operate — Bucher realized she could either use her business acumen to become one of the most effective PR reps in the game, or evolve into something more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was seeing what was going on in business, and because I could understand the context, I understood business, and because I understood business, my PR pitches would be very business focused,” Bucher told TechCrunch on today’s episode of Equity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She founded Day One Ventures in 2018 after realizing she could create more impact — and make better returns — by investing in startups and providing them with integrated PR support. By combining these two functions, she could help portfolio companies more meaningfully while backing only the stories she truly believed in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The structure of PR services is very misaligned,” Bucher said, noting that PR firms working on a contract basis often lean toward working slower so they can stretch out client payments. “For startups, it’s really important to move fast.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond speed, there’s a cost barrier: “Early-stage companies shouldn’t be paying $10, $20, or $30 grand per month for six months to get one announcement in TechCrunch. I just don’t think that’s fair, and I don’t think it’s sustainable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Day One’s integrated model allows Bucher to work with startups at critical early stages when they need support most. Younger startups might pivot or experience founder shake-ups, and “you need to be trusted to advise and help them make decisions.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backing a company financially gives her something many traditional PR firms can’t offer: She’s literally invested in the story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have an ambition to be, ideally, the first investor in the most important and ambitious ideas and companies of our time,” Bucher said. “I think that starts with you understanding the field, understanding the business, getting a conviction on the business. And once you have this conviction — which you’ve proved by investing in the company — you have the right to introduce it to reporters with much higher integrity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Someone in PR who gets access to everything from investor decks to a startup’s data room has serious advantages in positioning the company and understanding what’s at stake. And for Bucher, it makes the work more compelling. Doing PR for whatever companies are big enough to pay might be good business, “but that doesn’t mean it’s a good story.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with any VC, Bucher answers to her investors — in Day One’s case, that’s more than 70 LPs, including institutions, individuals, and more than 15 of the firm’s own portfolio founders. That means her bets need to be carefully considered. When Bucher chooses companies, she’s not only asking whether she wants to see their vision become reality, but whether the founder has the ethics and moral compass to maintain their values as the company scales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She points to Valar Atomics, a startup developing advance nuclear reactors, as an example. Day One <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/10/nuclear-startup-valar-atomics-raises-130-million.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">co-led a $130 million round</a> into the startup last month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I can’t think of a better founder,” she said, referring to Valar’s CEO Isaiah Taylor, noting she trusts him with “literally life-and-death” decisions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That moral filter means there are companies she wouldn’t back, even if they’re getting hype. Bucher said she wasn’t swayed by AI startup Cluely’s rage-bait “cheat on everything” marketing strategy. Rather, she’s proud to have invested in some of the most innovative technologies in areas like reproductive tech (<a href=\"https://www.orchidhealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Orchid’s</a> embryo selection technology), accessible healthcare (<a href=\"https://superpower.com/?srsltid=AfmBOook08N1SgXG4iVTDvxlWKNNMJcRxLx4dMEiu8WjpSoSWpDSEmim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Superpower</a>), and law-enforcement software (<a href=\"https://abelpolice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Abel’s</a> AI-optimized report-writing tools).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Day One’s portfolio includes early bets on companies like Sam Altman’s World, the email app Superhuman, and the remote work platform Remote.com, with at least 12 unicorns under its belt and $115 billion-plus in portfolio value. Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/vc-queen-masha-bucher-largest-fund-150m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Day One closed its Fund III with $150 million</a>, targeting early-stage founders “solving humanity’s most pressing issues,” and has grown over the last six years from $11 million in assets under management to well over $450 million today, says Bucher.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to use comms to solve companies’ business goals, unlock new opportunities, and to help them, ultimately, to grow shareholder value,” Bucher said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The two sides have spent months negotiating what the next version of the contract would look like, but those negotiations have been complicated by President Trump’s push to privatize the USPS, the Post reports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the current agreement, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency’s revenue in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The USPS is a longstanding and trusted partner and we remain committed to working together,” Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in a statement, adding that the company is discussing “ways to extend our partnership.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Kelly said Amazon was “surprised to hear” the USPS wants to “run an auction” for some of its shipping capacity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[S]o we still have a lot to work through. Given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we’re evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon already operates a large transportation network that includes airplanes, Rivian electric vans, and a budding drone delivery service — though the drone program has faced a number of struggles this year, including most recently, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/25/amazon-faa-probe-delivery-drone-incident-texas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Federal Aviation Administration probe</a>.

The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/snowflake-anthropic-expanded-partnership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$200 million multi-year AI deal</a> that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform and, consequently, to its sizable customer base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in the blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It’s a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic in October signed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/deloitte-goes-all-in-on-ai-despite-having-to-issue-a-hefty-refund-for-use-of-ai/\">deal with Deloitte</a> to bring its Claude chatbot to the consulting giant’s employee base of more than 500,000 staff. That same week, Anthropic struck a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-and-ibm-announce-strategic-partnership/\">partnership with IBM</a> to bring some of its LLMs into the latter’s software products.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s enterprise success isn’t surprising as the company’s models have garnered strong and growing traction among enterprises.

The European Commission on Thursday <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2896\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp in October <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">changed its business API policy</a> to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Meta is found guilty of breaching EU’s antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp, for its part, called the EU’s claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies’ chatbots. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/07/indias-nexus-venture-partners-announces-new-450m-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">operated as a single fund</a> and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abhishek Sharma, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars or around $1 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus, which operates with an eight-member investment team, began with a $100 million fund and has kept its fund size at $700 million since <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/tech/funding/nexus-venture-partners-closes-its-largest-ever-fund-at-700-million/articleshow/98329133.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launching Fund VII in 2023</a>. It typically raises every 2.5 to 3 years. Bhattacharjee said the reason for keeping the eighth fund the same size was the firm believes $700 million is the right amount for its early-stage strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though India’s AI journey is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not as advanced as the U.S.’s</a> in many areas, Nexus believes India could leapfrog in several parts of the AI ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bhattacharjee underlined the country’s large talent pool, rising digital infrastructure, and demand for localized models that support India’s many languages and service needs. These dynamics, he said, are pushing Indian startups to build AI applications and agents faster, often atop open source tools and emerging domestic AI infrastructure companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partners pointed to companies backed by Nexus, such as Zepto and Neysa, to illustrate how AI is taking shape in India. They said Zepto, the quick-commerce platform, uses AI extensively across its operations — from customer support to routing and fulfillment — demonstrating how consumer businesses are becoming deeply AI-native. Besides, infrastructure players like Neysa are emerging to address India-specific needs, including sovereign AI workloads, localized data handling, and support for the country’s many languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus did not share fund metrics. The partners said its funds have been realizing significant enough returns over the years to largely fill this fund from returning limited partners. The firm’s LP base spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

The second and third trending news queries were “Iran” and “US Government Shutdown,” respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for recipes and food, the top spot went to the sweet-and-spicy condiment hot honey, while Marry Me Chicken and chimichurri rounded out the top three.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For movies, the top trending search was “Anora” followed by “Superman” and the “Minecraft Movie.” The top trending search for actors went to “Anora” star Mikey Madison.

The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as HubSpot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Formerly known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/frances-sendinblue-an-all-in-one-digital-marketing-platform-raises-160m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sendinblue</a>, Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a <a href=\"https://www.brevo.com/blog/becoming-brevo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new name</a> reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&amp;M.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After joining the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/the-age-of-the-centaur-100m-arr-is-the-new-cloud-valuation-milestone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">centaur club</a> in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting <a href=\"https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Delivers-Record-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results-Driven-by-Agentforce--Data-360/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$41.55 billion</a> in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured. (Brevo claims “double-digit EBITDA margin.”)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These coffers have already supported Brevo’s plans to <a href=\"https://www.maddyness.com/uk/2025/02/17/brevo-to-invest-e50m-in-ai-over-five-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invest €50 million in AI</a> over five years and to use <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/11/2793572/0/en/Brevo-Acquires-WonderPush-and-Octolis.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquisitions</a> (11 to date) as one of its growth levers. The 1,000-employee company now intends to use its new funding to support these two endeavors, alongside its push in the U.S., on which it plans to spend over €100 million, according to a press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brevo didn’t disclose the exact valuation resulting from its latest round. It did give more details on its updated cap table. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rumors had described the deal <a href=\"https://pe-insights.com/general-atlantic-and-oakley-capital-near-e1bn-acquisition-of-crm-software-firm-brevo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as Brevo getting acquired</a>, but Thiberge said Brevo’s management and employees still hold the largest share (26%) while new entrants General Atlantic and Oakley Capital each bought 25%; existing investors Bpifrance and Bridgepoint collectively retained 24%, while <a href=\"https://it.sendinblue.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/06/SendinBlue_Release_Funding-091217-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Series A lead Partech</a> completed its exit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This makes for a global cap table that mirrors Brevo’s stated ambition to “build a global European CRM leader capable of competing with U.S. players through product excellence.” In other words, not through playing the European sovereignty card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Thiberge, “whoever has the best product wins, and it’s a race to see who can make the product that is both the most complete and the easiest to use.” There’s an inherent tension to doing this, and to catering both to mid-market companies and very small businesses. “I’m not saying it’s easy every day … but for us, this combination has been incredibly successful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To serve this diverse audience, Brevo has significantly expanded beyond its email marketing roots. While it still competes with Mailchimp in that space, the company now offers an all-in-one platform with marketing automation, CRM, customer data management, and communication across email, SMS, WhatsApp, live chat, push notifications, and even integrated sales calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These functionalities are also increasingly boosted by AI, either through integrations or in-house. Expanding this feature set is one driver of Brevo’s M&amp;A strategy, but inorganic growth from buying competitors in key markets is the other. With acquisitions expected to contribute 45% of its €1 billion revenue target for 2030, the company’s shopping list should be extensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated to correct cap table details.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This year it’s all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AWS re:Invent 2025</a>, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. <br><br>“We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent. Be sure to check back.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-doubling-down-on-llms\">Doubling down on LLMs</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced more tools for enterprise customers to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/aws-doubles-down-on-custom-llms-with-features-meant-to-simplify-model-creation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create their own models</a>. Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier. <br><br>For instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure. The serverless model customization can be accessed through either a self-guided path or by prompting an AI agent.<br><br>AWS also announced Reinforcement Fine Tuning in Bedrock, which allows developers to choose a preset workflow or reward system and have Bedrock run their customization process automatically from start to finish.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-andy-jassy-shares-some-numbers\">Andy Jassy shares some numbers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took to social media platform X to expound on AWS chief Matt Garman’s keynote speech. The message: The current generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip Trainium2 is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/andy-jassy-says-amazons-nvidia-competitor-chip-is-already-a-multi-billion-dollar-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">already bringing in loads of cash</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His comments were tied to the reveal of its next-generation chip, Trainium3, and meant to forecast a promising revenue future for the product.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-database-savings-arrives\">Database savings arrives</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tucked among the dozens of announcements is one item that is already getting cheers: Discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specifically, AWS said it was launching Database Savings Plans, which help customers reduce database costs by up to 35% when they commit to a consistent amount of usage ($/hour) over a one-year term. The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.duckbillhq.com/blog/aws-database-savings-plans-six-years-of-complaining-finally-pays-off/\">in his blog post</a>, “Six years of complaining finally pays off.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-t-get-a-better-deal-than-free-amazon-hopes\">Can’t get a better deal than free, Amazon hopes  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Is there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year’s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/amazon-hopes-to-jump-start-its-ai-coding-tool-kiro-by-giving-it-away-to-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+</a> to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-training-chip-and-nvidia-compatibility\">An AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS introduced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new version of its AI training chip</a> called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expanded-agentcore-capabilities\">Expanded AgentCore capabilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-announces-new-capabilities-for-its-ai-agent-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform</a>. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-nonstop-ai-agent-worker-bee\">A nonstop AI agent worker bee</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-nova-models-and-services\">New Nova models and services</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-launches-new-nova-ai-models-and-a-service-that-gives-customers-more-control/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">four new AI models</a> within its Nova AI model family — three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS’s big pitch is flexibility and customization.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lyft-s-argument-for-ai-agents\">Lyft’s argument for AI agents</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/aws-and-lyft-bringing-agentic-ai-to-life-for-riders-and-drivers\">piped up during the event</a> to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-factory-for-the-private-data-center\">An AI Factory for the private data center</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced “AI Factories”</a> that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.
