EQT is a large Swedish multi-asset investor, and its venture fund EQT Ventures, is one of 1X’s backers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal involves shipping up to 10,000 1X Neo humanoid robots between 2026 and 2030 to EQT’s more than 300 portfolio companies with a concentration on manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, and other industrial use cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">1X will sign individual deals with each of EQT’s interested portfolio companies, 1X confirmed to TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This partnership is particularly interesting because 1X’s Neo has been marketed as a humanoid for personal use and tagged as the “first consumer-ready humanoid robot designed to transform life at home.” Unlike some of 1X’s peers, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/12/face-to-face-with-figures-new-humanoid-robot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Figure</a>, it has not been marketed as a bot for commercial purposes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">1X does have a robot designed for industrial purposes, Eve Industrial, but this deal specifically involves the Neo humanoid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the company <a href=\"https://www.1x.tech/neo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opened up preorders</a> for the $20,000 robot in October, the announcement was focused on how the robot would operate in someone’s home from descriptions of the different chores that the robot is able to perform and how it interacts with people.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal is quite a different use case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s likely because humanoids for the home will remain a hard sell for quite some time while industrial use cases are an easier sell. The $20,000 price tag automatically limits the potential pool of consumer customers too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Neo specifically also comes with a privacy element that would be hard to swallow for many people — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/i-tried-the-robot-thats-coming-to-live-with-you-its-still-part-human-68515d44?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdD1hZ8nNTH85OJ6pCEoSHR7hBC8ZeyuTwSas6HVo-5RVip4oGMyv3wZfpX1bI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693af506&amp;gaa_sig=H31v4w64kgyXt1bZRWvBB3yNyYp9Jfz_-DAQrg2Y1xbNLiEPnHsnF7VAXQ86jVkVXrplVVfCbcxfoCbCpsEAcA%3D%3D\">human operators from 1X are able to look through the robots eyes</a> into someone’s home.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humanoids also come with potential safety issues around pets and small children due to their size and instability. Multiple VCs and scientists in the robotics field told TechCrunch this summer that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-world-is-just-not-quite-ready-for-humanoids-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">humanoid adoption wouldn’t be for multiple years</a>, if not a decade away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company declined to share how many preorders it received for its Neo bot but a spokesperson said preorders “far exceeded” the company’s goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2014, 1x has since raised more than $130 million in venture capital from firms, including EQT Ventures, Tiger Global, and the OpenAI Startup Fund, among others.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It was raised almost entirely from individuals. We ended up with 105 LPs,” she said. “If you don’t have a track record, then what they’re investing in is you. Like it is basically, like, raising a gigantic angel round with no lead.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that outsider perspective, she’s been able to position herself as the call founders make before they meet with their board to practice and discuss strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Fubini encourages the leadership teams he works with to carefully consider who they are entering into partnership with. His rubric follows three core tenets: person, firm, terms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You work with this person for forever. So it’s everything from like, are they fun? Do you trust them? Do they have the juice to get the deal done? It’s everything around this human,” he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both VCs noted the change from the most recent 2022-23 bear market — where VCs held all the cards  — to the current eager dealmaking atmosphere where founders have a bit more power. This makes choosing the right VCs that much more important, they say. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fubini called this shift “thrilling” because, even though both sides still need to do their diligence and ensure they are good fit together, “you can move so quickly” compared to  cautious bear markets. “I think that’s fun and joyful,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both Feinzaig and Fubini are full of tactical advice for both VCs seeking creative ways to capture founder attention and founders seeking smartest choices for their cap tables. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pitch deck and cold emails may not have the power they once did but creating authentic relationships and proving on execution remains the best strategies to attract the kind of people you want to work with — from both perspectives.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>New episodes of Build Mode drop every Thursday. </em><a href=\"https://pod.link/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vWUZMNjEyNzkzNjQ5NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Subscribe to the podcast </em></a><em>or watch on </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TechCrunch/featured\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>.

However, the company lost a little ground on its related lawsuit against Apple, which was also over in-app purchase restrictions and commission structure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Epic Games launched a version of its Fortnite game that routed around the existing in-app payment systems on iOS and Android devices in 2020, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/fortnite-app-store-removed-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google</a> removed the game from their respective app stores. Epic Games used that move to then file antitrust lawsuits against both companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Apple’s case, the court ruled the iPhone maker was not a monopolist but said Apple needed to allow developers to point to other payment mechanisms if they chose. Apple has been fighting the specific terms of that agreement, which were today <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-appeals-court-partly-reverses-sanctions-against-apple-epic-games-antitrust-2025-12-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partially overturned</a> by an appeals court that called some of the restrictions “overbroad.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of note, the new filing states Apple can tell developers not to make their links to payments bigger or more prominent than Apple’s own. It also says Apple is allowed to charge a fee on purchases made outside its App Store. The latter is a significant blow to developers, who had finally been able to skirt Apple’s commission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Epic Games has reason to celebrate by returning to the Google Play Store after Google lost its court battle with the game developer, where it was ruled to have engaged in anticompetitive behavior. Under the new agreement, Google allows app developers to point to alternative payment mechanisms and caps the fees Google could charge.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/epic-games-ceo-calls-googles-antitrust-settlement-a-win-for-androids-vision-as-an-open-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">called it a “comprehensive solution”</a> that doubled down on Android as an open platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Apple ruling is below: </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"View Epic v Apple - 9th Circuit Order - 20251211 on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/964701553/Epic-v-Apple-9th-Circuit-Order-20251211#from_embed\"> Epic v Apple – 9th Circuit Order – 20251211 </a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"View TechCrunch's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/publisher/17551504/TechCrunch#from_embed\"> TechCrunch </a> </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The code red called for a shift in priorities, including stalling on commitments like introducing ads and instead focusing on creating a better ChatGPT experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5.2 is OpenAI’s push to reclaim leadership, even as some employees <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/client/auth?state=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fai%2Fopenai-sam-altman-google-code-red-c3a312ad%3Fst%3DYvoLtR%26reflink%3Darticle_copyURL_share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> asked for the model release to be pushed back so the company could have more time to improve it. And despite indications that OpenAI would focus its attention on consumer use cases by adding more personalization and customization to ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-5.2 looks to beef up its enterprise opportunities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is specifically targeting developers and the tooling ecosystem, aiming to become the default foundation for building AI-powered applications. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/openai-boasts-enterprise-win-days-after-internal-code-red-on-google-threat/?_thumbnail_id=3073655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI released new data</a> showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This comes as Gemini 3 has become tightly integrated into Google’s product and cloud ecosystem for multimodal and agentic workflows. Google this week launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-going-all-in-on-mcp-servers-agent-ready-by-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">managed MCP servers</a> that make its Google and Cloud services like Maps and BigQuery easier for agents to plug into. (MCPs are the connectors between AI systems and data and tools.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says GPT-5.2 sets new benchmark scores in coding, math, science, vision, long-context reasoning, and tool use, which the company claims could lead to “more reliable agentic workflows, production-grade code, and complex systems that operate across large contexts and real-world data.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those capabilities put it in direct competition with Gemini 3’s Deep Think mode, which has been touted as a major reasoning advancement targeting math, logic, and science. On OpenAI’s own benchmark chart, GPT-5.2 Thinking edges out Gemini 3 and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 in nearly every listed reasoning test, from real-world software engineering tasks (SWE-Bench Pro) and doctoral-level science knowledge (GPQA Diamond) to abstract reasoning and pattern discovery (ARC-AGI suites). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Research lead Aidan Clark said that stronger math scores aren’t just about solving equations. Mathematical reasoning, he explained, is a proxy for whether a model can follow multi-step logic, keep numbers consistent over time, and avoid subtle errors that could compound over time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are all properties that really matter across a wide range of different workloads,” Clark said. “Things like financial modeling, forecasting, doing an analysis of data.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the briefing, OpenAI product lead Max Schwarzer said GPT-5.2 “makes substantial improvements to code generation and debugging” and can walk through complex math and logic step by step. Coding startups like Windsurf and CharlieCode, he added, report “state-of-the-art agent coding performance” and measurable gains on complex multi-step workflows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond coding, Schwarzer said that GPT-5.2 Thinking responses contain 38% fewer errors than its predecessor, making the model more dependable for day-to-day decision-making, research, and writing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5.2 appears to be less a reinvention and more of a consolidation of OpenAI’s last two upgrades. GPT-5, which dropped in August, was a reset that laid the groundwork for a unified system with a router to toggle the model between a fast default model and a deeper “Thinking” mode. November’s GPT-5.1 focused on making that system warmer, more conversational, and better suited to agentic and coding tasks. The latest model, GPT-5.2, seems to turn up the dial on all of those advancements, making it a more reliable foundation for production use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For OpenAI, the stakes have never been higher. The company has made commitments to the tune of $1.4 trillion for AI infrastructure buildouts over the next few years to support its growth — commitments it made when it still had the first-mover advantage among AI companies. But now that Google, which lagged behind at the start, is pushing ahead, that bet might be what’s driving Altman’s “code red.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s renewed focus on reasoning models is also a risky flex. The systems behind its Thinking and Deep Research modes are more expensive to run than standard chatbots because they chew through more compute. By doubling down on that kind of model with GPT-5.2, OpenAI may be setting up a vicious cycle: spend more on compute to win the leaderboard, then spend even more to keep those high-cost models running at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is already reportedly spending more on compute than it had previously let on. As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/leaked-documents-shed-light-into-how-much-openai-pays-microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch reported</a> recently, most of OpenAI’s inference spend — the money it spends on compute to run a trained AI model — is being paid in cash rather than through cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the call, Simo suggested that as OpenAI scales, it is able to offer more products and services to generate more revenue to pay for additional compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But I think it’s important to place that in the grand arc of efficiency,” Simo said. “You are getting, today, a lot more intelligence for the same amount of compute and the same amount of dollars as you were a year ago.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For all its focus on reasoning, one thing that’s absent from today’s launch is a new image generator. Altman reportedly said in his code red memo that image generation would be a key priority moving forward, particularly after Google’s Nano Banana (the nickname for Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model) had a viral moment following its August release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, Google launched Nano Banana Pro (aka Gemini 3 Pro Image), an upgraded version with even better text rendering, world knowledge, and an<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/googles-nano-banana-pro-makes-ultrarealistic-ai-images-it-scares-the-hell-out-of-me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> eerie, real-life, unedited vibe</a> to its photos. It also integrates better across Google’s products, as demonstrated over the past week as it pops up in tools and workflows like Google Labs Mixboard for automated presentation generation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI reportedly plans to release another new model in January with better images, improved speed, and better personality, though the company didn’t confirm these plans Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI also said Thursday it’s rolling out new safety measures around mental health use and age verification for teens, but didn’t spend much of the launch pitching those changes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated with more information about OpenAI’s compute efficiency status. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

Beyond the AI assistant, the company detailed how it has developed a software and new hardware, including a custom 5nm processor built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC, that will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expand its hands-free driving assistance system</a> and eventually let drivers take their eyes off the road.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This vertical integration work has been underway for years. In 2024, the EV maker completely reworked the guts of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/06/rivian-refresh-r1t-r1s-second-generation-speed-range-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV</a>, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, sensor stack, and software user interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s software team led by Bensaid has continued to work on building out the software stack. A smaller group — the size of which Rivian won’t disclose — focused on the AI assistant, which is designed to be model and platform agnostic, according to Bensaid.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To power this AI assistant, Rivian developed what it has described as a model- and platform-agnostic architecture that uses custom large language models and is branded as Rivian Unified Intelligence, or RUI. This hybrid software stack includes its own custom models and the “orchestration layer,” the conductor that makes sure the various AI models work together. Rivian said it has used other companies for specific agentic AI functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Riven Unified Intelligence is the connective tissue that runs through the very heart of Rivian’s digital ecosystem,” Bensaid said at the event. “This platform enables targeted agent solutions that drive value across our entire operation and our entire vehicle life cycle.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, RUI will be used for more than just providing an AI assistant, according to the company. It will also be used to improve vehicle diagnostics, which Rivian describes as “an expert assistant for technicians, scanning telemetry and history to pinpointing complex issues.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>The article was updated to clarify that the AI assistant will be augmented by frontier large language mode</em>ls.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rivian says it will charge a one-time fee of $2,500 or $49.99 per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What that means is you can get into the vehicle at your house, plug in the address to where you’re going, and the vehicle will completely drive you there,” Scaringe said Thursday, describing a point-to-point navigation feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After that, Rivian plans to allow drivers to take their eyes off the road. “This gives you your time back. You can be on your phone, or reading a book, no longer needing to be actively involved in the operation of vehicle.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s driver assistance software won’t stop there; the EV maker laid out plans on Thursday to enhance its capabilities all the way up to what it’s calling “personal L4,” a nod to the level set by the Society of Automotive Engineers that means a car can operate in a particular area with no human intervention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After that, Scaringe hinted that Rivian will be looking at competing with the likes of Waymo. “While our initial focus will be on personally owned vehicles, which today represent a vast majority of the miles driven in the United States, this also enables us to pursue opportunities in the ride-share space,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To help accomplish these lofty goals, Rivian has been building a “large driving model” (think: an LLM but for real-world driving), part of a move away from a rules-based framework for developing autonomous vehicles that has been led by Tesla. The company also showed off its own custom 5nm processor, which it says will be built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That custom chip powers what Rivian is referring to as its third-generation “autonomy computer,” or ACM3. The new computer can process 5 billion pixels per second and will start showing up on Rivian’s upcoming mass-market R2 SUV in late 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian will couple the ACM3 with a lidar sensor at the top of the windshield (from an undisclosed supplier) to provide “three-dimensional spatial data and redundant sensing,” which it says will help with “real-time detection for the edge cases of driving.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect that at launch in late 2026 this will be the most powerful combination of sensors and inference compute in consumer vehicles in North America,” senior vice president of electrical hardware Vidya Rajagopalan said at the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The R2 is set to start shipping in the first half of 2026, meaning the launch versions of the SUV will not have ACM3 or the lidar sensor. But the company said in a press release that it aims to “continuously improve the autonomy capabilities” of its “Gen 2 R1 and future R2 vehicles, with a clear trajectory including point-to-point, eyes off and personal L4.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company believes it can reach an advanced state of autonomy in many of its current vehicles without the new hardware — but Scaringe said Thursday that the new hardware suite will “enable a much higher ceiling than we have in our vehicles today.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Adding lidar creates the ultimate sensing combination. It gives the most comprehensive 3D model of the space the vehicle is traveling through,” vice president of autonomy and AI James Philbin said Thursday. “The goal for our onboard sensing stack isn’t just human level, it’s superhuman level.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company mentioned that the simulation runs at 24 fps and 720p resolution. Runway said that while Worlds could be useful for gaming, it’s also well-positioned to teach agents how to navigate and behave in the physical world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With GWM-Robotics, the company aims to use synthetic data enriched with new parameters like changing  weather conditions or obstacles. Runway says this method could also reveal when and how robots might violate policies and instructions in different scenarios.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Runway is also building realistic avatars under GWM-Avatars to simulate human behavior.

The new update brings native audio and long-form, multi-shot generation capabilities to the model. The company said that with this model, users can generate one-minute videos with character consistency, native dialogue, background audio, and complex shots from various angles. The company said that you can also edit existing audio and add dialogues. Plus, you can edit multi-shot videos of any length.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Gen 4.5 update nudges Runway closer to competitor Kling’s all-in-one video suite, which <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kling-ai-launches-video-2-6-model-with-simultaneous-audio-visual-generation-capability-redefining-ai-video-creation-workflow-302634067.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also launched earlier this month</a>, particularly around native audio and multi-shot storytelling.

TechCrunch then alerted Freedom Chat founder Tanner Haas to the security flaws by email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Haas confirmed to TechCrunch that the app has now reset user PINs and released a new version. Haas added that the company is removing instances where users’ phone numbers were occasionally visible, and has notched up rate-limiting on its servers to prevent mass-guess attempts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daigle, who published his findings <a href=\"https://ericdaigle.ca/posts/super-secure-maga-messaging-app-leaks-everyones-phone-number/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a blog post</a>, told TechCrunch it was possible to enumerate the phone numbers of close to 2,000 users who had signed up to use Freedom Chat since it launched. Daigle said Freedom Chat’s servers allowed anyone to flood it with millions of phone number guesses to determine if a user’s phone number was stored on the servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per Daigle, this technique is identical to one <a href=\"https://www.univie.ac.at/en/news/detail/forscherinnen-entdecken-grosse-sicherheitsluecke-in-whatsapp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described by the University of Vienna</a> in research last month, where <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/a-simple-whatsapp-security-flaw-exposed-billions-phone-numbers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">academics scraped</a> data on some 3.5 billion user accounts who signed up to WhatsApp by matching billions of phone numbers against WhatsApp’s servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daigle also found Freedom Chat was leaking users’ PIN codes. Using an open source network traffic inspection tool to analyze the data going in and out of the app, Daigle saw that the app would respond with the PIN codes of every other user in the same public channel — even if the PINs weren’t visible to users within the app itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Daigle, anyone who was in the default Freedom Chat channel, which users are automatically subscribed to when they first sign up, had their PIN broadcast to everyone else in the channel. Daigle told TechCrunch that knowledge of a person’s PIN could allow someone to open the app from a user’s stolen device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an app store update published Sunday, Freedom Chat noted: “A critical reset: A recent backend update inadvertently exposed user PINs in a system response. No messages were ever at risk, and because Freedom Chat does not support linked devices, your conversations were never accessible; however, we’ve reset all user PINs to ensure your account stays secure. Your privacy remains our top priority.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Freedom Chat is Haas’ second messaging app, after Converso, which was delisted from app stores following the disclosure of <a href=\"https://crnkovic.dev/testing-converso/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">security flaws</a> that exposed users’ private messages and content.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now the startup has proven its technology works and is seeing demand from wind farms and beyond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oslo, Norway-based Spoor has built software that uses computer vision to track and identify bird populations and migration patterns. The software can detect birds within a 2.5-kilometer radius (about 1.5 miles) and can work with any off-the-shelf high-resolution camera.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wind farm operators can use this information to better plan where wind farms should be located and to help them better navigate migration patterns. For example, a wind farm could slow down its turbines, or even stop them entirely, during heavy periods of local migration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ask Helseth (pictured above left), the co-founder and CEO of Spoor, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/spoor-uses-ai-to-save-birds-from-wind-turbines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told TechCrunch</a> last year that he got interested in this space after learning that wind farms lacked effective tracking methods, despite many countries having strict rules around where wind farms can be built and how they can operate due to local bird populations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The expectations from the regulators are growing but the industry doesn’t have a great tool,” Helseth said at the time. “A lot of people [go out] in the field with binoculars and trained dogs to find out how many birds are colliding with the turbines.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helseth told TechCrunch last week that since then, the company has proven the need for this technology and worked to make it better.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074781\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png 4250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=1200,763 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=1280,814 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=430,273 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=720,458 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=900,572 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=800,509 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=2048,1302 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=668,425 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=590,375 590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=970,617 970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=708,450 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spoor</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of its seed raise in 2024, Spoor was able to track birds in a 1-kilometer range, which has since doubled. As the company has collected more data to feed into its AI model, it has been able to improve its bird identification accuracy to about 96%.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Identifying the species of the bird for some of the clients, you add another layer,” Helseth said. “Is it a bird or not a bird? We have an in-house ornithologist to help train the model to train the new types of birds or a new type of species. Having deployment in other countries [means] having rare species in the database.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spoor now works across three continents and with more than 20 of the world’s largest energy companies. It has also started to see interest from other industries such as airports and aquaculture farms. Spoor has a partnership with Rio Tinto, a London-based mining giant, to track bats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also received interest in using its tech to track other objects of similar size — but Helseth said they aren’t thinking of pivoting into those areas quite yet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Drones are of course a plastic bird in our mind,” Helseth joked. “They move in a different way and have a different shape and size. Currently we are discarding that data but we are getting interest in it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spoor recently raised an €8 million ($9.3 million) Series A round led by SET Ventures with participation from Ørsted Ventures and Superorganism in addition to strategic investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helseth predicts that interest in this type of technology will only grow as regulators continue to crack down on wind farms. For example, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/french-energy-giant-ordered-switch-212220642.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">French regulators shut down a wind farm</a> in April due to its impact on the local bird population and imposed hundreds of millions of fines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our mission is to enable industry and nature to coexist,” Helseth said. “We have started on that journey, but we are still a small startup with a lot to prove. In the coming years, we want to really cement our position in the wind industry and become a global leader to tackle these challenges. At the same time, we want to build some proof points that this technology has value beyond that main category.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rather than pump harder or inject something to force oil to the surface, Eclipse sends down microbes to munch on the oil molecules and liberate their hydrogen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of viscous oil, companies only have to deal with hydrogen gas. “Hydrogen flows a lot easier,” Sekhon said, making it easier to extract it from the well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Houston-based startup, which was spun out of Cemvita, demonstrated the technology at an oilfield in California’s San Joaquin Basin last summer. Now, it’s partnering with oilfield services company Weatherford International to deploy the technology around the world, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. The first projects will begin in January.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re an extension of our team,” Sekhon said to characterize the relationship with Weatherford. “They’ll be our operational arm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eclipse, which was previously known as Gold H2, has been developing the technology over the last several years. It has been sampling microbes that naturally occur in oil wells, which live at the interface between oil and water held in aquifers, to find those that are best suited to the job.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the microbes consume the oil, they break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Both then flow to the surface, where Eclipse and its partners will eventually separate the two. About half of the carbon dioxide is likely to stay in the reservoir, while the other half could be captured using specialized equipment and either sequestered or used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal, Sekhon said, is to produce low-carbon hydrogen for around 50 cents per kilogram, or the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-hydrogen-review-2021/executive-summary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">same price</a> as hydrogen obtained by breaking down natural gas in an industrial plant, a process that releases more carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The resulting hydrogen could be used in petrochemical plants or burned for energy. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s taking a liability and turning it into a clean energy asset,” Sekhon said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But like many open source projects, Backstage is a build-it-yourself option.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Israeli startup Port has been gaining big-name customers like GitHub, British Telecom, and LG with a proprietary Backstage competitor: a dev tool portal that’s also now been geared to manage AI agents.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Port, founded in 2022, said it raised a fresh $100 million Series C round led by General Atlantic, with participation from Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Team8. The round values Port at $800 million and brings its total funding to date to $158 million. This Series C follows the company’s $35 million Series B led by Accel and Bessemer, <a href=\"https://www.port.io/blog/port-raises-35m-for-its-end-to-end-internal-developer-portal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> in May. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of all the industries that LLM-based tech has infiltrated, coding is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">where it has the deepest roots</a>. So, not surprisingly, developers are also on the cutting edge of building and adopting agents that can automate entire repeated processes — work far beyond asking AI to write some code. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the problem here, according to Port co-founder and CEO Zohar Einy, it’s the Wild West right now for such dev tool agents at companies: finding them, sharing them, ensuring their work follows company standards, and so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developers “want to take AI beyond just coding. They want it to resolve incidents, resolve security issues. They want it to take care of the release management,” Einy told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if agents are connected to all kinds of different tools and data sources, if the data is scattered among them, if they have no way to collaborate, and have no corporate standards and guardrails, “it creates chaos,” his product pitch goes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Port therefore offers more than just a catalog of dev and agent tools (although it does offer those). It supplies a layer of orchestration with features that measure agent performance and add a human in the loop, as desired, to approval processes.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A feature called “context lake” defines the data sources, context memory, and guardrails for agents. “It’s where you manage what agents ‘need to know’ to do their job safely and correctly,” Einy explained. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to using Port to catalog agents devs have already created using other tools, they can use Port to create new agents. Plus, Port also offers a few of its own ready-made agents, which can do things like resolving help desk tickets and dealing with provisioning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einy describes his product as handling the other 90% of what software programmers do that isn’t writing code. “It gives the engineers a user interface to control the agent, to iterate with the agent, to approve what it does that is not coding, that is all the 90%.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its giant new war chest of cash, big name customers and tier-one VCs, Port looks like an agentic management startup to watch. But to say it faces competition is an understatement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entire category of agentic management and orchestration is flooded with hopefuls, from Big Tech companies to startups, and they’re all coming at the various new problems in the space from different angles. A few of these include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/open-source-agentic-startup-langchain-hits-1-25b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LangChain</a>, UiPath, Cortex, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

So Radulescu teamed up with Ioana Hreninciuc and launched Runware as a dev tool platform that specializes in generating images, videos, and audio in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has seen much growth since it first launched. It has powered more than 10 billion creations for more than 200,000 developers, the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The product lets developers integrate Runware’s API into their apps and then generate media assets through one interface, so they don’t have to set up any new infrastructure or maintain separate integrations. It has a custom AI inference infrastructure for open source models and provides day-zero access (meaning as soon as a model is released, it can run on Runware) and competitive pricing, Hreninciuc, who focuses on operations and GTM, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, the company announced a $50 million Series A in a round led by Dawn Capital. Dawn Capital partner <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/dawn-capitals-shamillah-bankiya-breaks-down-the-state-of-the-euro-venture-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shamillah Bankiya</a> is joining the board. Others in the round include Comcast Ventures, Speedinvest, Insight Partners, and a16z Speedrun. Runware has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/runware-uses-custom-hardware-and-advanced-orchestration-for-fast-ai-inference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $66 million in funding to date</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hreninciuc said the company remains competitive through its pricing, which is “more-cost effective,” in addition to having a fully unified API. She said the company does this with its Sonic Inference Engine, which runs on custom AI hardware. It also partners with third-party AI cloud providers so that it can reroute workloads automatically in case more memory is needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On the software side, we heavily optimize model loading and offloading, which lets us support over 400,000 models and make any of them available for inference in real time,” she continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups that focus on dev tools for image and video have been a particularly hot market for VC interest lately. Fal.ai, for instance, just raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/fal-nabs-140m-in-fresh-funding-led-by-sequoia-tripling-valuation-to-4-5b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$140 million at a $4.5 billion valuation</a>, its second giant raise in a matter of months. Fal.ai focuses on the breadth of model offerings versus customizing for speed. So, Hreninciuc considers her competitors to be Fal.ai and Replicate, a startup that runs open source models in apps with just a few lines of code.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies, as Radulescu previously told TechCrunch, sell based on GPU compute time. Runware instead leans toward the model of Stable Diffusion and Flux, offering a more cost-per-image generated so that people can pay for what they need rather than buying a block of compute time. <strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hreninciuc said the fresh capital will be used to keep expanding the company’s infrastructure and it hopes to use its Sonic Inference Engine to power over 2 million models. The big goal is to be the API for all AI — so that any generative AI model can and does run on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re also expanding rapidly into new modalities,” she said, adding that the company is going to expand the current team of around 25 to help make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Hreninciuc hopes Runware continues to “make it possible for applications to scale to millions of users while actually keeping their margins,” she said, adding that it helps make the market more affordable. That “benefits everyone,” she continued. “From the app builders to the end users, and puts powerful AI into more people’s hands globally.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to correct the spelling of Radulescu</em>‘s<em> name</em> <em>and to update what the competitors are</em>, <em>and who else participated in the round. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
