This tech, much of it created in Silicon Valley, sits on your wrist, is carried in your pocket, is integrated in the movies you watch, and maybe in the music you listen to. And it is certainly the means by which that Amazon package was ordered, sorted, and delivered to your doorstep. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has turned their founders, executives, and middle managers into king-like figures, whose wealth and political influence mirrors the Gilded Age. Seven of the top 10 richest people in the world can tie their wealth directly to tech. Amazon co-founder, chairman, and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is third, behind just Meta co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\">according to Forbes</a>, which tracks wealth and the people who have it. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer round out the list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, in this moment, the Bezos-owned Washington Post has gutted its coverage of them and the tech industry at large as part of a sweeping set of layoffs that affected more than 300 people. The team that includes tech, science, health and business was cut by more than half — from 80 to 33 people — according to Post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/drewharwell/status/2019155688140812777\">tech reporter Drew Harwell</a>. The tech desk alone cut 14 people. Its San Francisco bureau is a shell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among those affected include reporters covering Amazon, artificial intelligence, internet culture, and investigations. The newspaper also laid off staff covering the media industry (which had previously reported on Bezos’ ownership over their own paper). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post cut its entire sports bureau and nearly annihilated its foreign reporting teams, including its Middle East desk, and reporters and their editors covering Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and others. It closed its Books section, decimated coverage of culture and the Washington, D.C., metro area, and laid off all reporters and editors covering race and ethnicity issues nationally. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The coverage of tech isn’t more important than social, economic, and geopolitical issues. But never before have the people exerting outsized influence on the world’s geopolitics and economy also been so directly responsible for stemming the global flow of information about it. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet even as the world centers on tech and is tied to the GDP growth — or retreat — of its superpowers, tech’s most powerful executives are asking the public to place their attention elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post’s executive editor Matt Murray couched the layoffs as a reboot of sorts aimed at reaching readers and eventually profitability, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html\">according to the New York Times</a>, which included comments he made to staff. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If anything, today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people’s lives in what is becoming a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,” he reportedly said during a Zoom meeting with staff.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s no secret The Post has lost money and subscribers in recent years, in some cases due to policies crafted or backed by Bezos. For instance, his directive to end presidential endorsements by The Post’s editorial board, axing a drafted piece backing Kamala Harris, reportedly led to “hundreds of thousands” of canceled subscriptions, per the New York Times. It reportedly suffered $100 million in losses in 2024, in part because of the cancellations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its web traffic has also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-sad-and-self-inflicted-decline\">declined</a>. Semafor <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/01/12/2025/letter-from-la\">reported</a> that daily visits were down to around 3 million by the middle of 2024, from 22.5 million in January 2021.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post cut its staff from 1,000 to under 800 last spring, with CEO Will Lewis calling out the $100 million loss from the previous year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The layoffs at The Post, of course, don’t exist in a vacuum. The media industry, and not just legacy players, has been plagued by a fragmented audience and changes to Google Search algorithms that have directed readers away from news outlets and toward its own AI generated answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The size, scope, and location of those cuts merit scrutiny, however — particularly considering the shift in media ownership over the past 15 years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bezos’ acquisition of the Post in 2013 for $250 million was met with a mix of skepticism and hope from weary journalists who had experienced consolidation, layoffs, and the growing pains of moving from a print-only to digital-dominant media industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His acquisition became part of a broader trend at the time in which billionaires, many with backgrounds in tech, snapped up beleaguered media organizations well worn from the previous go public-private equity cycle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few years after Bezos bought The Post, Laurene Powell Jobs purchased The Atlantic, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time Inc., and pharmaceutical executive Patrick Soon-Shiong acquired the Los Angeles Times. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bezos, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-apologizes-for-saying-national-guard-troops-needed-in-san-francisco/\">Benioff</a> and Soon-Shiong (who also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/media/la-times-editor-quits-patrick-soon-shiong-endorsement.html\">blocked</a> his paper’s endorsement of Harris), moved closer to Trump after he won the 2024 election. His spaceflight company Blue Origin relies on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-ula-expected-clinch-multibillion-dollar-contract-key-pentagon-launch-2025-04-04/\">federal contracts</a>, and Amazon had faced increased scrutiny under previous administrations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lewis was reportedly not present to oversee the staff cuts and changes at The Post (Murray <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/jeremymbarr/status/2019204813574271228\">told Fox News</a> that the CEO “had a lot of things to tend to today”). Nor was Bezos. As his newspaper prepared to cut one-third of its staff, Bezos <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/hegseth-sees-plenty-of-winning-for-bezos-s-blue-origin\">spent Monday with</a> Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in Florida, leading him on a tour of Blue Origin’s facilities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Less than 48 hours later, The Washington Post would lay off the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aaron-gregg-766bb125_i-was-laid-off-from-the-washington-post-today-activity-7424941320009601025-qoZv/\">journalist</a> who <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/13/blue-origin-layoffs/\">reported</a> on Blue Origin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The darkness, it seems, is creeping in. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But one aspect of it is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-5IsqFgrZM\">completely unique to these times</a>: startups rocketing from $0 to as much as $100 million in annual recurring revenue, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/as-lovable-hits-200m-arr-its-ceo-credits-staying-in-europe-for-its-success/\">sometimes in a matter of months.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Word on the street is that many a VC won’t even look at a startup that’s not on the ARR superhighway, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregoiregambatto_if-you-planned-to-be-at-2m-arr-and-raise-activity-7380932640482414592-O0Pm/\">aiming for $100 million in ARR before their Series A</a> funding round.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Andreessen Horowitz general partner Jennifer Li⁠, who helps oversee many of the firm’s most important AI companies, warns that some of the ARR mania is based on myths. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not all ARR is created equal, and not all growth is equal either,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/\">Li said on an episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast</a>. She said to be especially skeptical of a founder announcing spectacular ARR numbers or growth in a tweet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, there is a legit, well-recognized term in accounting called annual recurring revenue, which refers to the annualized value of contracted, recurring subscription revenue. Essentially, that’s a guaranteed level of revenue because it comes from customers on a contract. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what many of these founders are tweeting about is really “revenue run rate” —  taking whatever money was paid in a period of time and annualizing it. That’s not the same.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a lot of missing nuances of the business quality, retention, and durability that’s missing in that conversation,” Li warned.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A founder may have just had a killer month of sales, but not every month will necessarily repeat it. Or a startup may have a lot of short-term customers doing pilot programs, so revenue isn’t guaranteed to stick around after the pilot period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Normally, such boasts about growth via tweets should be treated for what they are: don’t believe everything you read on the internet at face value. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But because fast-growth is a hallmark of AI startups, such claims are “introducing a lot of anxiety” to inexperienced founders who are now asking how they can also instantly go from zero to $100 million, she said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li’s answer: “You don’t. Sure, it’s a great aspiration, but you don’t have to build a business that way, to only optimize for the top-line growth.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She said a better way to think of it is: how to grow sustainably, where once customers sign up, they stick around and expand their spend with your company. This can lead to “growing 5x or 10x year-over-year,” said Li, meaning growth from $1 million to between $5 million and $10 million in the first year, to between $25 million to $50 million in year two, and so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li pointed out is that this is still “unheard of” levels of growth. If it’s coupled with happy customers — aka high retention rates — those startups will find investors willing to back them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, some of the portfolio companies in Li’s a16z group (the infrastructure team) have hit those kinds of racing ARR numbers: Cursor, ElevenLabs, and Fal.ai. But that growth is tied to “durable businesses,” said Li, adding, “There’s real reasons behind each of them.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li also said that kind of growth comes with its own set of operational problems like hiring. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How do we hire, not fast, but the right people who can really jump into this type of speed and culture,” she said. And the answer is: not easily. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means those first 100 people wear a lot of hats and missteps are bound to happen. Last year, Cursor, for instance, angered its customer base <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/\">with a poorly rolled out pricing change.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li pointed out that other fast-growth startups deal with legal and compliance issues before they have systems in place to, or face new AI-age issues like countering deepfakes. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So while lightning-fast growth can be a good problem to have, it’s also a little bit like: be careful what you wish for. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Listen to the full episode here:</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But a week later, it is clear that he is dead serious. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most obvious step, of course, is the formal merger between SpaceX and xAI that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">went forward on Monday</a>, officially drawing together Musk’s space and AI ventures in a way that makes a lot more sense if there’s some kind of joint infrastructure project planned. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even beyond the merger, we’re starting to see the idea of orbital AI data clusters — essentially, networks of computers operating in space — cohere into an actual plan. On Wednesday, the FCC accepted the filing and set a schedule seeking public comment. It’s a pro forma step normally, but FCC chairman Brendan Carr took the unusual step of <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/2019139559330836506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sharing the filing on X</a>. Throughout his tenure as chairman, Carr has shown himself <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/612069/fcc-brendan-carr-elon-musk-donald-trump-first-amendment-free-speech-censorship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eager to help Trump’s friends and punish his enemies</a> — so as long as Musk stays on Trump’s good side, the proposal is likely to sail through without issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, Elon Musk has started to flesh out the argument for orbital data centers in public. On a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cheekypint.transistor.fm/21\">new episode</a> of Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison’s podcast “Cheeky Pint,” which also featured guest Dwarkesh Patel, Musk laid out the basic case for moving most of our AI computing power into space. Essentially, solar panels produce more power in space, so you can cut down on one of the main operating expenses for data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space,” Musk said in the podcast. “Any given solar panel is going to give you about five times more power in space than on the ground, so it’s actually much cheaper to do in space.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Close listeners will note that there is a bit of a gap in the logic here! It’s true that solar panels produce more power in space, but since power isn’t the only cost in operating a data center and solar panels aren’t the only way to power a data center, it doesn’t follow that it’s cheaper to do the whole thing in orbit, as Patel noted in the podcast. Patel also raised concerns about servicing GPUs that fail during AI model training, but you’ll have to listen to the full episode for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Musk was undeterred, marking 2028 as a tipping point year for orbital data centers. “You can mark my words, in 36 months but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,” Musk said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He didn’t stop there. “Five years from now, my prediction is we will launch and be operating every year more AI in space than the cumulative total on Earth,” Musk continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For context, as of 2030, global data center capacity will be <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.jll.com/en-us/insights/market-outlook/data-center-outlook\">an estimated 200 GW</a>, which is roughly a trillion dollars’ worth of infrastructure when you’re just putting it on the ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, SpaceX makes its money by launching things into orbit, so all this is pretty convenient for Musk — particularly now that SpaceX has an AI company attached to it. And with the new SpaceX-xAI conglomerate headed for an IPO in just a few months, you can expect to hear a lot more about orbital data centers in the months ahead. With tech companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">still pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into data center spending each year</a>, there’s a real chance that not all the money will remain earthbound.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For those working in government bureaucracy, it’s equally exciting, apparently, that NASA approved this rule change pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” Isaacman wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It makes sense that it would be hard to approve new technology to go into space — if one small thing goes astray, a spaceflight can go terribly wrong.

It’s an open platform, which means users can manage agents built outside of OpenAI too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Frontier users can program AI agents to connect to external data and applications, which allows them to execute tasks far outside of the OpenAI platform. Users can also limit and manage what these agents have access to, and what they can do, of course.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said Frontier was designed to work the same way companies manage human employees. Frontier offers an onboarding process for agents and a feedback loop that is meant to help them improve over time the same way a review might help an employee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI touted enterprises, including HP, Oracle, State Farm, and Uber as customers, but Frontier is currently only available to a limited number of users with plans to roll out more generally in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company would not disclose pricing details in a press briefing earlier this week, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/874258/openai-frontier-ai-agent-platform-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting from The Verge</a>. OpenAI declined to comment on pricing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agent-management products become table stakes since AI agents rose to prominence in 2024. Salesforce has arguably the best-known such product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/salesforce-ai-chatbot-agentforce-hits-general-availability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Agentforce</a>, which the company launched in the fall of 2024.

Opus 4.5 was only released <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last November</a>, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">currently offers</a>. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">White told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software development — into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Coming just months after its Series B, Clay’s offer of liquidity was a rarity in a market where tender offers, as these types of secondary transactions are known, were still uncommon for relatively young companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, several other newer, fast-growing startups have allowed their staff to convert some of their stock into cash. Linear, a six-year-old AI-powered Atlassian rival, completed <a href=\"https://linear.app/now/giving-our-team-liquidity-through-linear-s-first-tender-offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a tender offer</a> at the same valuation as the company’s $1.25 billion Series C. More recently, the three-year-old ElevenLabs authorized a $100 million secondary sale for staff, at a valuation of <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/announcing-an-employee-tender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$6.6 billion</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elevenlabs-raises-180-million-in-series-c-funding-at-3-3-billion-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">double</a> its previous value.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And just last week, Clay, which has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $100 million in one year, decided it was again time for its employees to cash in on the company’s fast growth. The eight-year-old startup announced that its staff can sell stock at a valuation of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/dealbook/clay-start-up-tender-offers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$5 billion</a>, a more than 60% increase from its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/clay-confirms-it-closed-100m-round-at-3-1b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$3.1 billion</a> valuation announced in August.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These secondary sales at increasingly higher valuations for young, perhaps still-unproven companies may initially appear to be a premature “cash-out” reminiscent of the 2021 bubble. The most infamous example of that time was Hopin, whose founder, Johnny Boufarhat, reportedly sold $195 million worth of his company’s stock just two years before the company’s assets were sold for a <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/networking/ringcentral-to-pay-50m-for-startup-hopin-s-events-management-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tiny fraction</a> of its peak <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/hopin-ringcentral/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$7.7 billion</a> valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there is a critical distinction between the 2021 boom and today’s market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the ZIRP era, a large portion of the secondary deals provided liquidity almost exclusively to founders of buzzy companies like Hopin. In contrast, the recent transactions from Clay, Linear, and ElevenLabs are structured as tender offers that also benefit employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While investors these days largely frown upon the outsized founder payouts of the 2021 boom, the current shift toward employee-wide tender offers is viewed far more favorably.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve done a lot of tenders, and I haven’t seen any drawbacks yet,” Nick Bunick, a partner at the secondary-focused VC firm NewView Capital, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As companies stay private longer and talent competition intensifies, allowing employees to turn some of their paper gains into cash can be a powerful tool for recruiting, morale, and retention, he said. “A little liquidity is healthy, and we’ve certainly seen that across the ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of Clay’s first tender offer, co-founder Kareem Amin <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/clay-authorizes-employee-tender-at-a-1-5b-valuation-led-by-sequoia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told TechCrunch</a> that the main reason for giving employees a chance to cash out some of their otherwise-illiquid stock was to ensure that “the gains don’t just accumulate to a few people.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some fast-growing AI startups are realizing that without offering early liquidity, they risk losing their best talent to public companies or more mature startups like OpenAI and SpaceX, which regularly offer tender sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s hard not to see the positive aspects of allowing startup employees to reap cash rewards from their hard work, Ken Sawyer, co-founder and managing partner at secondary firm Saints Capital, pointed to unintended second-order effects of employee tenders. “It is very positive for employees, of course,” he said. “But it enables companies to stay private longer, reducing liquidity for venture investors, which is a challenge for LPs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, relying on tenders as a long-term substitute for IPOs could create a vicious cycle for the venture ecosystem. If limited partners don’t see cash returns, they will be more reluctant to back the very VC firms that invest in startups.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Launched last September, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/meta-launches-vibes-a-short-form-video-feed-of-ai-slop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vibes</a> lets you create and share short-form AI-generated videos and access a dedicated feed that displays AI videos from others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Think TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every video you come across is AI generated. Until now, the feed has lived in the Meta AI app. By making Vibes available outside of the Meta AI app, the company is positioning it as a more direct competitor to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/openais-sora-app-is-struggling-after-its-stellar-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sora, OpenAI’s AI-generated video and social app</a> that launched shortly after Vibes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, is confident enough that it’s building a massive reactor that costs several hundred million dollars. But the device won’t be turned on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/commonwealth-fusion-systems-installs-reactor-magnet-lands-deal-with-nvidia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">until next year</a>, leaving the question unanswered for now.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies that were founded more recently think they have a shot at building a fusion power plant for less, including <a href=\"https://www.pacificfusion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pacific Fusion</a>. Today the company announced the results of a series of experiments it performed at Sandia National Laboratories that it says will eliminate some costly parts of its approach. The company exclusively shared the results with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion power promises to generate large amounts of electricity 24/7 and deliver it in a way that’s familiar to today’s grid operators. Most fusion startups are targeting the early to mid-2030s to switch on their first commercial fusion power plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pacific Fusion is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/heres-how-pacific-fusion-plans-to-build-a-fusion-power-plant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">chasing an approach</a> known as pulser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF). At its core, it’s similar to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">experiments</a> carried out at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The company compresses small fuel pellets in rapid succession, and that compression causes atoms inside the fuel to fuse and release energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But where NIF uses lasers to kick off the compression, Pacific Fusion wants to use massive pulses of electricity. Those pulses will create a magnetic field that encircles the fuel pellet — about the size of a pencil eraser — causing it to compress in less than 100 billionths of a second.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The faster you can implode it, the hotter it’ll get,” Keith LeChien, co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the challenges with pulser-driven ICF is that the process has typically needed a bit of a kick-start to work properly. To create conditions in the fuel pellet hot enough for fusion, researchers have been using both lasers and magnets to warm it up beforehand. “It’s just a little bit of energy just to give it a little bit of a boost before you compress it,” LeChien said, on the order of 5% to 10% of the total energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the added lasers and magnets add upfront complexity, cost, and maintenance requirements to the machine, making it that much harder to sell power at competitive prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So in the experiments at Sandia, Pacific Fusion tweaked the design of the cylinder encasing the fuel pellet and adjusted the electrical current delivered to it. Before the big pulse of electricity that ignites the fusion reaction, the company allowed a bit of the magnetic field to leak through to the fuel before compressing it, warming it in the process. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can make very subtle changes to how this cylinder is manufactured that allow the magnetic field to leak or to seep into the fuel before it’s compressed,” LeChien said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pacific Fusion’s fuel is loaded in a plastic target that’s wrapped in aluminum. By varying the thickness of the aluminum, the company can adjust how much of the magnetic field makes its way to the fuel. The casing needs to be manufactured with some precision, but nothing crazy, LeChien said — something on the order of what’s required for a .22 caliber bullet casing. “That’s a process that’s been honed and manufactured and perfected over 100-plus years,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tweaks don’t significantly change how much energy Pacific Fusion needs to deliver to the target. “It doesn’t take much energy to actually allow that magnetic field into the center of the fuel,” he said. “It’s a tiny fraction, much less than 1%. It’s a very, very, very small fraction of the overall energy in the system, so it’s effectively unnoticeable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eliminating the magnetic system would simplify the system and its maintenance requirements, which would have a modest effect on overall cost, he said. But getting rid of the laser would cut costs significantly. “The scale of laser [needed] to preheat these types of systems at high gain is north of $100 million.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeChien said experiments like this also help refine the company’s simulations to ensure they’re in agreement with what happens in the real world. “A lot of people have simulated things and said, ‘Oh, this will work or that will work,’” he said. “It’s a very different game to simulate something, build it, test it, and have it work. Closing that loop is hard.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s the headline; the subtext is more intriguing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stockpile initiative, branded as Project Vault, is the administration’s latest attempt to secure supplies of critical minerals for U.S. manufacturers and what President Donald Trump says will ensure “American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It follows recent investments from the administration into rare earth producers, including equity stakes in miners <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/usa-rare-earth-enters-pact-for-1-6-billion-of-federal-funds-22626027?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqeDeoStXNGzrT5S2o8Q5DS-WzddeezvmvKR4t4iGSfvIlJBcqsZEz7w&amp;gaa_ts=69823f54&amp;gaa_sig=JmZjyUCHLkSNVbGQ-wYz-q4uA3NBd_wWS5WOeEMFQKCBqbzlg9BvEpzFBIkE0YNhKnfVfCoO5oFBWSs4c0iG_A==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">USA Rare Earth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MP Materials</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Individually, they can be interpreted as an administration taking steps to calm a part of the market that has been roiled by its own trade wars. Collectively, they’re an admission, however tacit or subconscious, that the future relies on electric technologies, including electric vehicles and wind turbines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his announcement, Trump alluded to the world’s dependence on China for a slew of critical minerals. Over the last year-plus, China has wielded its dominance to counter tariff threats from the Trump administration, restricting exports of rare earth metals and lithium battery materials to the United States. Eventually, China relented, but the episode made clear who held the trump card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spat also revealed just how integral critical minerals are to modern economies. Trump likened the new stockpile to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintained by the Department of Energy, which was set up in the wake of the oil embargo in the early 1970s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defense, we’re now creating this reserve for American industry, so we don’t have any problems,” Trump said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The oil reserve isn’t going away, but it’s not as important as it once was, diminished by productive U.S. oil wells and the increasing share of the energy market taken by solar, wind, and batteries. (Solar and wind <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2025/setting-the-scene#abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">continue to dominate</a> new electric-generating capacity, while <a href=\"https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-ev-leapfrog-how-emerging-markets-are-driving-a-global-ev-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 25% of new cars</a> sold worldwide are EVs or plug-in hybrids.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear exactly which minerals will go into the reserve; Bloomberg reported that gallium and cobalt will be included. It’s possible that others like copper and nickel might get thrown in as well, though they weren’t mentioned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The size of the investment is notable. The U.S. Export-Import Bank is providing a $10 billion loan, with private capital rounding out the rest. That’s about half the value of the oil currently in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve going toward a market that’s 1% the size of the global oil market, as Bloomberg columnist David Fickling <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2026-02-03/a-12-billion-critical-minerals-reserve-promises-a-glut?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pointed out</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The mismatch is either typical Trump bluster or an acknowledgment that the market for critical minerals is going to expand significantly in the coming years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is possible it’s both, with a greater chance it is the latter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the growth in critical minerals comes from clean energy technologies and EVs; without them, the market won’t be as constrained as experts have predicted. Demand for electronics, including data centers, will play a role, but more than half of global growth in rare earth element demand is expected to come from electric vehicles and wind turbines, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/critical-minerals-data-explorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to the IEA. For cobalt and lithium, the figures are even more skewed, with EVs representing the vast majority of growth through 2050.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration hasn’t been quiet about its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/trump-doe-confirms-its-canceling-over-700m-in-manufacturing-grants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disdain</a> for clean energy technologies, preferring to bet on the status quo with fossil fuels. But the rest of the world is continuing to move toward solar, wind, and batteries, driving up demand for critical minerals. The new stockpile shows that markets can be hard to ignore.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don’t work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Called a large tabular model (LTM) rather than a large language model (LLM), Fundamental’s Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn’t rely on <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the transformer architecture</a> that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that’s within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Fraenkel sees it, that’s a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to big data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The result, he argued, is a shift in how people interact with technology. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the years ahead, he said, “hopefully all our phones will go back in our pockets, and we can immerse ourselves in the real world around us, with voice as the mechanism that controls technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That vision fueled ElevenLabs’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/elevenlabs-raises-500m-from-sequioia-at-a-11-billion-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$500 million raise</a> this week at an $11 billion valuation, and it is increasingly shared across the AI industry. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/openai-bets-big-on-audio-as-silicon-valley-declares-war-on-screens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/googles-ai-mode-can-now-have-back-and-forth-voice-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a> have both made voice a central focus of their next-generation models, while Apple appears to be quietly building voice-adjacent, always-on technologies through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/apple-buys-israeli-startup-q-ai-as-the-ai-race-heats-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquisitions like Q.ai.</a> As AI spreads into wearables, cars, and other new hardware, control is becoming less about tapping screens and more about speaking, making voice a key battleground for the next phase of AI development. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iconiq Capital general partner Seth Pierrepont echoed that view onstage at Web Summit, arguing that while screens will continue to matter for gaming and entertainment, traditional input methods like keyboards are starting to feel “outdated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And as AI systems become more agentic, Pierrepont said, the interaction itself will also change, with models gaining guardrails, integrations, and context needed to respond with less explicit prompting from users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staniszewski pointed to that agentic shift as one of the biggest changes underway. Rather than spelling out every instruction, he said future voice systems will increasingly rely on persistent memory and context built up over time, making interactions feel more natural and requiring less effort from users. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That evolution, he added, will influence how voice models are deployed. While high-quality audio models have largely lived in the cloud, Staniszewski said ElevenLabs is working toward a hybrid approach that blends cloud and on-device processing — a move aimed at supporting new hardware, including headphones and other wearables, where voice becomes a constant companion rather than a feature you decide when to engage with. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ElevenLabs is already partnering with Meta to bring its voice technology to products, including Instagram and Horizon Worlds, the company’s virtual-reality platform. Staniszewski said he would also be open to working with Meta on its Ray-Ban smart glasses as voice-driven interfaces expand into new form factors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as voice becomes more persistent and embedded in everyday hardware, it opens the door to serious concerns around privacy, surveillance, and how much personal data voice-based systems will store as they move closer to users’ daily lives — something <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/google-pays-68-million-to-settle-claims-its-voice-assistant-spied-on-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">companies like Google</a> have already been accused of abusing.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify has partnered with <a href=\"http://bookshop.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bookshop.org</a> on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities. Spotify then earns an affiliate fee on sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop’s website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089631\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=720,360 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=900,450 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=800,400 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=668,334 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=708,354 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February.

The tool analyzes the page content and directs users to the exact spot in the audiobook. It’s powered by a combination of Spotify’s in-house and third-party computer vision and image-scanning technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When users want to switch to the audiobook, they can select the “Scan to Listen” button and click the “Scan to Read” button to return to the physical book, making it easy for users to pick up where they left off, whether they’re reading at home or switching to audio while on the go.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Page Match is currently available for most English-language titles, with plans for future expansion.

The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQRu7DdTTVA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Another commercial</a> features a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack. After offering his height, age, and weight, the bot serves him an ad for height-boosting insoles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Anthropic commercials are cleverly aimed at OpenAI’s users, after that company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/\">recent announcement </a>that ads will be coming to ChatGPT’s free tier. And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/anthropic-super-bowl-ad-mocks-chatgpt-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“mocks,”</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-super-bowl-openai-chatgpt-ads-claude-2026-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“skewers,”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/873685/anthropics-first-super-bowl-ad-dunks-on-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“dunks on”</a> OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They are funny enough that even Sam Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">admitted on X</a> that he laughed at them. But he clearly didn’t really find them funny. They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users. ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/chatgpts-user-growth-has-slowed-report-finds/\">is still the most popular chatbot by a large margin</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the OpenAI CEO insisted the ads were “dishonest” in implying that ChatGPT will twist a conversation to insert an ad (and possibly for an off-color product, to boot).”We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote in the social media post. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, OpenAI has promised ads will be separate, labeled, and will never influence a chat. But the company has also said it is planning on making them conversation-specific — which is the central allegation of Anthropic’s ads. As OpenAI explained on <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its blog,</a> “We plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman then went on to fling some equally questionable assertions at his rival. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,” he wrote. “We also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Claude has a free chat tier, too, with subscriptions at $0, $17, $100, and $200. ChatGPT’s tiers are $0, $8, $20, and $200. One could argue the subscription tiers are fairly equivalent.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman also alleged in his post that “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI.” He argues it blocks usage of Claude Code from “companies they don’t like,” like OpenAI, and said Anthropic tells people what they can and can’t use AI for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">True, Anthropic’s whole marketing deal since day one has been <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-achieves-iso-42001-certification-for-responsible-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“responsible AI.”</a> The company was founded by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/26/the-openai-mafia-15-of-the-most-notable-startups-founded-by-alumni/\">two former OpenAI alums, after all</a>, who claimed they grew alarmed about AI safety when they worked there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, both chatbot companies have <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">usage policies</a>, AI guardrails, and <a href=\"https://openai.com/safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">talk about AI safety.</a> And while OpenAI allows ChatGPT to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotica-for-adult-users/\">be used for erotica</a> while Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">does not</a>, OpenAI, like Anthropic, has determined that <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some content should be blocked</a>, particularly in regards to mental health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet Altman took this Anthropic-tells-you-what-to-do argument to an extreme level when he accused Anthropic of being “authoritarian.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using “authoritarian” in a rant over a cheeky Super Bowl ad is misplaced, at best. It’s particularly tactless when considering the current geopolitical environment in which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/02/03/iran-protests-deaths-crackdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">protesters around the world</a> have been killed by agents of their own government. While business rivals have been duking it out in ads since the beginning of time, clearly Anthropic hit a nerve.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How can I communicate better with my mom?\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBSam25u8O4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Q4, Snap’s revenue <a href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Snap-Inc-Q4-25-Earnings-Slides.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was $1.7 billion</a>, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month/\">launched back in 2022</a>. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter — dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/snap-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-below-estimates-ad-competition-hurts-2026-02-04/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters also reports</a> that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/nation-world/snapchat-charge-users-storing-memories/507-73964864-5cb6-4dfb-b380-123b66626619\">charge users for Memories</a> storage — a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps — and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">announced the creation</a> of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,” said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a “strong standalone brand” for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal “to a different audience segment” than the “core Snapchat audience.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: “We’re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
