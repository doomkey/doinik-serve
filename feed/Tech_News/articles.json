The company is now adding more AI tools to Acrobat, including the ability to generate podcast summaries of files, create presentations, and a way for users to edit files using prompts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company launched <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/08/acrobat-studio-delivers-new-ai-powered-home-for-productivity-creativity\">Adobe Spaces</a> last year, which is a collection of files and notes that multiple users can access. Now, Adobe is allowing users to use the information stored in these files and notes to create a presentation using text prompts. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if a user has financial details, product plans, and competitor analysis available in a Space, they can build a pitch deck for clients that focuses on why their product can solve problems better than rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Acrobat’s AI assistant first generates an editable presentation with points that the deck would cover. You can then use Adobe Express’s theme library, stock photos, or use your own images to build the presentation. Plus, you can easily apply your brand’s theme or edit individual slides using Express.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084393\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Adobe</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tools like Canva and NotebookLM already offer the ability to convert documents into presentations.

I would play my word. She would play hers. We would play back and forth over a few days, and the entire time, neither of us would have to see any overwhelming technicolor ads with deceptive skip buttons that blast us with even more pop-ups. It’s a simple life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You would think such an app already existed. You would be wrong. Until now. (Zynga, I will never forgive you for what you’ve done to Words with Friends).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At last, New York Times Games has brought my humble dreams to life with a Scrabble-like multiplayer app called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/nyt-crossplay-play-and-spell/id6615086509\">Crossplay</a>, available now on iOS and Android. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crossplay is not a Scrabble clone exactly, but unless you are the type of Scrabble lover that goes to tournaments or memorizes the Scrabble dictionary, it’s basically Scrabble. The game board and tile distribution are a bit different, and there’s a slight rule change around what happens once the bag runs out of tiles. Those differences may have been done for legal reasons. As a casual player, I barely noticed them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other social word games, Crossplay allows you to invite friends to play, or you can get matched with strangers near your skill level. For New York Times Games subscribers, the game will have no ads at all, but free users might see some banner ads. Still, it beats paying <em>$10 a month</em> to remove ads from Words With Friends, yet still have to deal with a cartoon-like interface among other features that annoy me.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083192\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=768,393 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=680,348 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1200,613 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1280,654 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=430,220 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=720,368 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=900,460 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=800,409 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1536,785 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=2048,1047 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=668,341 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1207,617 1207w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=708,362 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Behold: one game that looks normal, and one that looks like Cocomelon for adults.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Crossplay (left), Words With Friends (right)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Scrabble purists may quibble about the slight rule changes, they may find delight in a feature of the game called CrossBot. Like the WordleBot and ConnectionsBot, CrossBot analyzes each move of your game to determine where you may have made a better move. It ranks your gameplay in terms of both luck and strategy, then highlights both your best moves, and those where you faltered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York Times has been publishing its Crossword puzzle since 1942, but its digital gaming business kicked into high gear in 2022 when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/\">bought Wordle</a> after it went viral. According to data from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351069/000119312524062156/d809296dpx14a6g.htm?utm_campaign=hollywood-s-cheap-ai-fix-won-t-work&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email\">ValueAct Capital</a>, a hedge fund that invests in the Times, users spent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895\">more time in the Games app</a> than the actual News app by the end of 2023.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m not the only one who was craving a multi-player word game without egregious distractions — Jonathan Knight, Head of Games at the New York Times, thinks this is what makes its Games vertical so successful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Games like Spelling Bee and Wordle found a way to take the magical ‘solve a puzzle’ feeling and create a very mainstream, quick, snackable version of that that works well on your phone, that’s very sharable with friends and family, and that I think is very respectful of your time,” Knight told TechCrunch. “You can just decide to do it in the morning, or at night before you go to bed, and then go to bed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the New York Times, Wordle was played 4.2 billion times in 2025. Connections was played 1.6 billion times.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch spoke to Wordle creator Josh Wardle shortly before he sold his game, he shared a mindset similar to Knight’s. He told us, “people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sure, a publicly traded company like the New York Times isn’t as pure of heart as an indie developer making a game for his partner, but the spirit of the game has persisted. Even as Wordle’s viral moment passed, people kept up with their daily habit, according to Knight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The share rate on Wordle — the percentage of users that share every day — has not changed since we acquired the game,” he said. “It’s a really cool way to bring people together. You know, we see the Pope talking about his Wordle, sharing with his brother.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Knight’s team wants to extend the quiet simplicity of its games philosophy to Crossplay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We wanted people to be able to just get in and play the game with friends and family, and then get on with your day,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s where Cam Badger got his start, at a pharmaceutical company. He expected to find structure and mentorship on the job but instead found “fragmented training, inconsistent coaching, and no real way to scale learning in a meaningful way,” he told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He spent four years as a sales rep, then a sales trainer, and then worked for a medical startup where he met Bhrugu Giri. The two lamented about how awful many sales reps were at life science companies like pharma businesses, medical device startups, and so forth. The duo decided to try and fix this, launching PraxisPro, a sales coaching platform specifically targeted at medical fields.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He believes that better salespeople will help get more treatments into doctor’s hands, which will ultimately help their patients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When commercial interactions with healthcare providers are ineffective, patients don’t get a fair shot at therapies that could meaningfully change their lives,” Badger, the company’s CEO, said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PraxisPro launched in 2023, though its first product was not released until 2025. The company announced on Wednesday a $6 million seed round led by AlleyCorp. Others in the round include FlyBridge, South Loop Ventures, and Zeal Capital Partners. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PraxisPro is a standalone platform that can also be integrated into enterprise software. It develops small language models trained on life science data to help each company navigate the nuances and context needed to interact with healthcare providers. From there, the company has created an AI agent that helps the commercial sales team practice their communication skills before engaging with customers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Badger said communication is critical in medical sales. So many teams are worried about staying compliant, as each company is responsible for ensuring sales messaging complies with legal frameworks. Aside from helping train sales reps to stay compliant, PraxisPro also hopes to help better execute them to communicate patient needs with healthcare providers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, a salesperson may have 15 interactions with a health care provider as part of the sales process. PraxisPro has a conversational AI feature that lets sales reps practice and plan these interactions and be better prepared for what the discussion usually entails, including any pushback that might come up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are other AI role-playing tools (like Quantified and SmartWinnr), but Badger says his is different because his company is trained on smaller data sets and specifically focuses on the life sciences sector. The fresh capital will be used toward research and development, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, this was the tool he wished he had when he was still working as a sales rep all those years ago. He struggled, he said, and almost lost his job, but managed to work his way up to become one of the company’s top performers. Now, he wants to give others a hand. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If we can give commercial teams the ability to prepare, practice, and engage at a higher level, consistently and responsibly, then we’re not just improving commercial operations, but we’re helping ensure that innovative therapies reach the patients who need them most,” he said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Lemonade said it would train its own usage-based risk prediction models to determine when a driver is using Full Self-Driving or operating the vehicle themselves, and price accordingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lemonade is calling the new product “Autonomous Car insurance.” Tesla’s software does not currently make cars completely autonomous, and drivers need to be ready to take over at any moment. But the product is clearly a bet that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will ultimately fulfill his long-delayed promise that his company will make that happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Traditional insurers treat a Tesla like any other car, and AI like any other driver. But a driver who can see 360 degrees, never gets drowsy, and reacts in milliseconds isn’t like any other driver,” Shai Wininger, co-founder and president of Lemonade, said in a statement. “Our existing pay-per-mile product has given us something no traditional insurer has: a unique tech stack designed to collect massive amounts of real driving data for precise, dynamic pricing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new car insurance product will launch in Arizona on January 26, and in Oregon the following month. Lemonade claims that “the safer FSD software becomes, the more our prices will drop.” The company’s existing auto insurance offering is available for “most popular cars” in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has offered its own car insurance to customers for years now, though in late 2025 the company was hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI). The automaker was accused, along with partner State National Insurance Company, of “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims,” “unreasonable denials,” and engaging in “unfair claims settlement practices.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has denied the allegations.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/03/advanced-geothermal-startups-are-just-getting-warmed-up/\">like Fervo and Sage Geosystems</a> have been pursuing that angle, and experts agree it has tremendous potential. By contrast, conventional geothermal, which taps naturally fractured hotspots, has been stagnant, generating just <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/2025-us-geothermal-market-report\">4 gigawatts</a> in the United States, up only <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=17871\">about a gigawatt</a> in the last decade or so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conventional geothermal has been held back by outdated assumptions, Hoiland told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They underestimated how many undiscovered systems there are, maybe by an order of magnitude or more,” Hoiland said. With modern drilling techniques, “you can get a lot more out of each of them, maybe even an order of magnitude or more from each of those. All of a sudden the number goes from tens of gigawatts to what could be a terawatt-scale opportunity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zanskar is relying on AI to help break conventional geothermal out of its malaise. In the process, the startup has resuscitated a flagging power plant in New Mexico and discovered two new sites with over 100 megawatts of combined potential.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those successes have helped Zanskar land a $115 million Series C led by Spring Lane Capital with participation from the All Aboard Fund, Carica Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Imperative Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Munich Re Ventures, Obvious Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, StepStone Group, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Tranquillion, Union Square Ventures, University Growth Fund, and UP.Partners.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many potential geothermal sites have been overlooked because people have been looking for evidence on the surface like a hot spring or a volcano, Hoiland said. But about 95% of all geothermal systems lack such a tell, he added. “We just keep finding them by accident. That is a great application for AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To find new geothermal resources, Zanskar first feeds supervised machine learning models a range of data, including past accidental discoveries. When they have identified a promising site, the company sends a team to the site validate the discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zanskar then has to come up with a plan to develop it. For that, the team uses another AI approach, one developed for this very purpose called Bayesian evidential learning (BEL). In BEL, existing data helps build a series of assumptions known as priors, and then models work to falsify those hypotheses, spitting out probabilities for each. Where there are gaps, the startup has built a geothermal simulator to fill in the blanks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Zanskar’s approach has been working. The previous funding round allowed the startup to explore three sites, each of which it considered a success. “Three of three,” said Zanskar co-founder and CTO Joel Edwards. “What does it look like when you try 10?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has enough sites in the pipeline to support at least a gigawatt of generating capacity, Hoiland said. For now, they’ve been focused on the U.S. West, which has the most potential. He would like to find at least 10 confirmed sites to help Zanskar court project finance investors, which provide access to lower cost capital than VCs. If the company can make that work, then it might get through the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/27/climate-startup-valley-of-death/\">valley of death</a> that has claimed many other climate tech startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hoiland is not convinced that Zanskar has solved all the challenges associated with finding geothermal resources, but he’s optimistic the company is on the right path.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We now know this is the future of exploration,” he said. “This is going to change geothermal in very short order.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Not coincidentally, it has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/preply-the-language-app-known-for-its-live-tutors-closes-out-series-c-at-120m-and-doubles-down-on-ai/\">ramped up AI integration</a> to support its 100,000 tutors and continue scaling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a fine line — Duolingo <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/duolingo-launches-148-courses-created-with-ai-after-sharing-plans-to-replace-contractors-with-ai/\">faced backlash</a> after declaring it would become <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/17/duolingo-ceo-says-controversial-ai-memo-was-misunderstood/\">an “AI-first company,”</a> and tutors have been a key differentiator for Preply. The company is adamant it won’t replace them — but AI can also bring consistency to a model that relies on self-employed instructors. The future of learning “is going to be human-guided and amplified by AI,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Bigai, Preply already applies AI to features such as lesson summaries and homework, but also to match learners to tutors that best fit their needs. To further develop these capabilities, he said Preply is now hiring AI talent across its four offices — Barcelona, London and New York but also Kyiv, which the company hasn’t left despite the Russian invasion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Preply is headquartered in the U.S., where it got its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lift99.co/blog/founder-stories-kirill-bigai-preply\">first start</a>, Bigai and his cofounders are Ukrainian and the company has been very actively <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://preply.com/en/stand-with-ukraine\">supporting their home country</a>. They have been doing that in several ways since the war started, including as an employer. “We are very committed [to the] Ukrainian office,” said Bigai.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Out of Preply’s 750 employees, approximately 150 people work from Kyiv, despite Russian strikes regularly forcing them into shelters and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/17/europe/russia-bombing-ukrainians-freezing-defiant-intl-cmd\">causing power outages</a> that have made the current freezing winter particularly challenging. “Our office has different generators so we have electricity, Internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Bigai said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These employees may be grateful to Preply — but Bigai is grateful to them and has deep admiration for his people. “Ukrainians are going through very challenging times, and it builds a significant resilience and creativity,” he said. Having to adapt to the reality and uncertainty of war also transformed Preply. “I think the fact that the company went through this experience — and how so many people helped other people — made us stronger, more resilient, more creative,” he added. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its new funding, the edtech company has now joined the growing cohort of unicorns with Ukrainian roots, including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://siliconcanals.com/ukraines-fintech-it-group-becomes-unicorn/\">Fintech-IT Group</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/05/29/ukrainian-unicorn-grammarly-raises-1-billion-from-general-captial/\">Grammarly</a>. But it may also follow in the footsteps of Airbnb, whose former CFO Laurence Tosi led the Series D through his growth equity firm, WestCap. While Bigai said Preply has no timeline or concrete IPO plans yet, he noted WestCap’s “phenomenal experience in [taking] companies public, which is one of the things that we will continue to think about.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For one, the popularity of AI assistants among consumers was a large driver, with all of the top 10 apps by downloads being AI assistants. This group was led by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek. ChatGPT alone generated $3.4 billion in global in-app purchase (IAP) revenue — a figure that we reported on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/chatgpts-mobile-app-hits-new-milestone-of-3b-in-consumer-spending/#:~:text=Worldwide%2C%20consumers%20spent%20an%20estimated,to%20reach%20the%202024%20figure.\">late last year</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084015\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg 1554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=300,256 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=768,656 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=680,581 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=1200,1025 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=1280,1094 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=430,367 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=720,615 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=900,769 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=800,684 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1313 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=668,571 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=439,375 439w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=722,617 722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=621,531 621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sensor Tower</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, consumers spent 48 billion hours in generative AI apps, or 3.6x the total time spent in 2024 and 10x the level seen in 2023.

Over the past year, they’ve been rolling out new capabilities at a rapid pace, improving in areas like coding assistance, content generation, reasoning, task execution, accuracy, and more. The report specifically called out improvements in image and video generation, like ChatGPT’s GPT-4o image generation model released in March, and Google’s Nano Banana.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among the top AI publishers, OpenAI and DeepSeek accounted for nearly 50% of global downloads, up from 21% in 2024.

The lawsuit against Snap was brought by a 19-year-old known in court documents as K.G.M., accusing the social media app of designing algorithms and features that caused addiction and mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit also names other platforms, including Meta, YouTube, and TikTok. No settlement has been reached with these platforms. Notably, Snap is still a defendant in other similar social media addiction cases filed against it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2025-12-03/snapchat-ignored-staff-warnings-about-teens-mental-health\">documents unveiled in the ongoing cases</a>, Snap employees raised concerns around risks to the mental health of teens dating back at least nine years. The company has said these examples were “cherry-picked” and were taken out of context.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaintiffs in these cases are drawing parallels to Big Tobacco — referring to lawsuits in the 1990s against cigarette companies that concealed health risks — alleging that the platforms obscured information about potential harms from their users. They argue that features like infinite scroll, auto video play and algorithmic recommendations have tricked users into continuously using apps, leading to depression, eating disorders, and self-harm, according to NYT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap CEO Evan Spiegel had been scheduled to testify in the trial, which would have marked the first time a social media company faces a jury in an addiction lawsuit — no platform has lost such a case at trial yet. The remaining case against Meta, TikTok, and YouTube is set to proceed with jury selection beginning next Monday, January 27, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expected to take the witness stand. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If plaintiffs prevail, legal experts predict the cases could result in multibillion-dollar settlements and potentially force platforms to redesign their products.

Amagi was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/general-atlantic-values-media-tech-amagi-at-1-4-billion-in-new-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last valued at $1.4 billion</a> in a private funding round in November 2022, after a $100 million raise led by General Atlantic, and investors sought to buy <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/issue-information?symbol=AMAGI&amp;series=EQ&amp;type=Past\">more than 30 times</a> the available shares.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-headquartered company sells cloud software that helps TV networks and streaming services distribute and monetize video, and earns almost all of its revenue outside India — including around 73% from the U.S. and about 20% from Europe — CEO and co-founder Baskar Subramanian said in an interview, making it a rare export-first technology listing on Indian exchanges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $196 million IPO included a fresh issue of shares worth ₹8.16 billion (about $89.33 million), while existing investors sold about 26.9 million shares through an offer-for-sale. The deal was smaller than Amagi’s earlier plan, after the company trimmed the fresh issue and reduced the number of shares to be sold by existing backers from 34.2 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Norwest Venture Partners, Accel, and Premji Invest were among Amagi’s existing shareholders who sold shares in the IPO. Subramanian told TechCrunch the sales were only a “very small portion” of holdings, and said the company’s founders were not selling a single share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For us as an event, it’s a pit stop in a long journey,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accel has particularly retained close to a 10% stake in Amagi after the IPO, even as the listing locks in a roughly 3.3x gain on shares it acquired at around ₹108 per share. “To make the IPO, we are reluctantly exiting as little as possible to make this happen,” said Shekhar Kirani, an Accel partner.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2008 by Subramanian, Srividhya Srinivasan, and Arunachalam Srinivasan Karapattu, Amagi counts content companies such as Lionsgate Studios, Fox, and Sinclair Broadcast Group among its clients, as well as distributors including Roku, Vizio, Rakuten TV, and DirecTV, and advertising platforms such as The Trade Desk and Index Exchange.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subramanian said Amagi is riding a shift as broadcasters and streamers move away from “big iron” hardware and satellite-based workflows toward cloud-based operations, arguing that only a small portion of the industry has completed the transition so far. The company has also begun pitching new automation and AI-driven tools to help media companies cut labor-heavy operating costs, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s revenue from operations rose 34.6% year-over-year to ₹7.05 billion (around $77.18 million) in the six months ended September 30, 2025, while net revenue retention was about 127% — meaning existing customers increased their spending by 27%, per its <a href=\"https://www.amagi.com/hubfs/Project%20Chrysalis%20-%20RHP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prospectus</a> (PDF).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi is betting that broadcast and live video are still in the early stages of moving to the cloud, Subramanian told TechCrunch, estimating that less than 10% of the industry has made the shift, leaving a long runway as media groups modernise infrastructure and expand ad-supported streaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s appeal lies in being a “premium” and highly reliable platform for blue-chip customers, said Rachit Parekh, a partner at Accel, arguing that downtime during major live events can be highly costly for broadcasters and streamers. This dynamic has helped drive high customer retention and expansion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, Amagi is also competing against legacy broadcast vendors that are racing to modernize their own offerings for the cloud, while its push into AI-driven automation will test whether Amagi can expand beyond infrastructure into software with better profit margins without rising cloud costs eating into profitability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi said it plans to plow most of the fresh proceeds into technology and cloud infrastructure, allocating ₹5.50 billion ($60.21 million) for that purpose, while also setting aside funds for potential acquisitions and general corporate use, per its prospectus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi’s debut comes as India’s IPO market has drawn a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/softbank-stays-in-as-meesho-606m-ipo-becomes-indias-first-major-e-commerce-listing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rising number of technology-led listings</a>, supported by strong domestic investor demand even as late-stage startup funding remains subdued. The shift has positioned public markets as both a growth-financing option and a path to exits for early backers, a dynamic that has become more visible as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/27/india-startup-funding-hits-11b-in-2025-as-investors-grow-more-selective/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">private capital has turned more selective</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s tech sector <a href=\"https://w.tracxn.com/report-releases/india-tech-annual-funding-report-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recorded 42 IPOs in 2025</a>, up from 36 in 2024, per market intelligence firm Tracxn. Several venture-backed startups, including consumer and fintech firms, are also widely expected to test public markets in 2026 as the pipeline builds.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Voice is a popular medium for communication among people and businesses in India. That’s why enterprises and startups are eager to use voice AI to be more efficient at customer support, sales, customer acquisition, hiring, and training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But recognizing market demand is one thing — proving businesses will pay is another. Y Combinator rejected the application from <a href=\"https://www.bolna.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bolna</a>, a voice orchestration startup built by Maitreya Wagh and Prateek Sachan, five times before finally accepting it into the fall 2025 batch, skeptical that the founders could turn interest into revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we were applying for Y Combinator, the feedback we got was, ‘great to see that you have a product that can create realistic voice agents, but Indian enterprises are not going to pay, and you are not going to make money out of this,’” Wagh told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup applied with the same idea for the fall batch but was able to show it had revenue of more than $25,000 coming in every month for the last few months. At that time, the company was running $100 pilots to help users build voice agents. Now the startup is pricing those pilots at $500.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The momentum has continued. The startup said on Tuesday that it has raised a $6.3 million seed round led by General Catalyst, with participation from Y Combinator, Blume Ventures, Orange Collective, Pioneer Fund, Transpose Capital, and Eight Capital. The round also includes individual investors, including Aarthi Ramamurthy, Arpan Sheth, Sriwatsan Krishnan, Ravi Iyer, and Taro Fukuyama.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-product-and-customers\">The product and customers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bolna is building an orchestration layer — essentially a platform that connects and manages different AI voice technologies — akin to startups like Vapi, LiveKit, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/voicerun-nabs-5-5m-to-build-voice-agent-factory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VoiceRun</a>, to suit the idiosyncrasies of interactions in India, including noise cancellation, getting verification on the caller ID platform Truecaller, and handling mixed languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Feature-wise, the company has built specific nuances for Indian users, such as speaking numbers in English regardless of the core language, or allowing for keypad input for longer inputs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083843\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg 2940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1200,682 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1280,728 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=720,409 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=900,512 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=800,455 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=668,380 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=659,375 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1085,617 1085w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=708,403 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bolna</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wagh noted that the key differentiation of Bolna is that it makes it easy for users to build voice agents by just describing them, even if they don’t know much about the underlying technology, and start using them for calls. The company said that 75% of its revenue is coming from self-serve customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also said that because Bolna is an orchestration layer, it doesn’t depend on a single model, so enterprises can easily switch when there is a better model available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our platform allows customers to switch models easily or even use different models for different locales to get the best out of them. An orchestration layer is necessary for enterprises to ensure they are getting the best models because one model can be better today and another one can be better tomorrow,” Wagh said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has a range of clients, including car reselling platform Spinny, on-demand house-help startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/indias-snabbit-valuation-doubled-to-180m-in-5-months-on-its-quick-house-help-bet/\">Snabbit</a>, beverage companies, and dating apps. Most of these are small to midsize businesses that use Bolna’s self-serve platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Separately, Bolna is pursuing large enterprise deals. For these large enterprises and custom implementations, Bolna has a team of forward-deployed engineers — specialists who work directly with clients on-site or closely with their teams. The startup has signed two large enterprises as paying customers and has four more in the pilot stage. Currently, Bolna employs nine forward-deployed engineers and is adding two to three people to that team every month to support this enterprise push.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bolna has seen steady growth in both call volumes and revenue. It say it’s now handling over 200,000 calls per day and on the verge of crossing $700,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company noted that while 60% to 70% of call volume is in English or Hindi, other regional languages are steadily rising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Akarsh Shrivastava, who is part of the investment team at General Catalyst, said that the firm found Bolna impressive because its orchestration layer is flexible for various kinds of customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bolna allows you the freedom to choose any model and has a stack behind it to mold it according to your requirement. It’s a good option for people who want to own some part of the stack, want flexibility in model picking, and want to be able to maintain those products themselves,” Shrivastava told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Maybe they aren’t these chipmakers’ shiniest, most advanced chips, but they’re high-performance processors used for AI, making the export controversial. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2026-01-20/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-on-the-future-of-ai-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unloaded</a> on both the administration and the chip companies over the decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The criticism was particularly notable because one of those chipmakers, Nvidia, is a major partner and investor in Anthropic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The CEOs of these companies say, ‘It’s the embargo on chips that’s holding us back,’” Amodei  said, incredulous, in response to a question about the new rules. The decision is going to come back to bite the U.S., he warned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are many years ahead of China in terms of our ability to make chips,” he told Bloomberg’s editor-in-chief, who was interviewing him. “So I think it would be a big mistake to ship these chips.” Amodei then painted an alarming picture of what’s at stake. He talked about the “incredible national security implications” of AI models that represent “essentially cognition, that are essentially intelligence.” He likened future AI to a “country of geniuses in a data center,” saying to imagine “100 million people smarter than any Nobel Prize winner,” all under the control of one country or another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The image underscored why he thinks chip exports matter so much. But then came the biggest blow. “I think this is crazy,” Amodei said of the administration’s latest move. “It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sound you hear? The team at Nvidia, screaming into their phones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia isn’t just another chip company. While Anthropic runs on the servers of Microsoft and Amazon and Google, Nvidia alone supplies the GPUs that power Anthropic’s AI models (every cloud provider needs Nvidia’s GPUs). Not only does Nvidia sit at the center of everything, but it also recently announced it was investing in Anthropic to the tune of up to $10 billion.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just two months ago, the companies <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-nvidia-anthropic-announce-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced that financial relationship</a>, along with a “deep technology partnership” with cheery promises to optimize each other’s technology. Fast-forward to Davos, and Amodei is comparing his partner to an arms dealer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Maybe it was just an unguarded moment — it’s possible he got swept up in his own rhetoric and blurted out the analogy. But given Anthropic’s strong position in the AI market, it seems more likely he felt comfortable speaking with confidence. The company has raised billions, is valued in the hundreds of billions, and its Claude coding assistant has developed a reputation as a highly beloved and top-tier AI coding tool, particularly among developers working on complex, real-world projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also entirely possible that Anthropic genuinely fears Chinese AI labs and wants Washington to act. If you want to get someone’s attention, nuclear proliferation comparisons are probably a pretty effective way to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s perhaps most remarkable is that Amodei could sit onstage at Davos, drop a bomb like that, and walk away to some other gathering without fear that he just adversely impacted his business. News cycles move on, sure. Anthropic is also on solid footing right now. But it does feel that the AI race has grown so existential in the minds of its leaders that the usual constraints — investor relations, strategic partnerships, diplomatic niceties — don’t apply anymore. Amodei isn’t concerned about what he can and can’t say. More than anything else he said on that stage, that fearlessness is worth paying attention to.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the company announced plans to revamp its mobile app and expand its short-form video feature, which it mentions could help promote the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/netflixs-first-original-video-podcasts-feature-pete-davidson-and-michael-irvin/\">new slate of original video podcasts</a> it unveiled last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Set to launch later in 2026, Netflix’s redesigned mobile app is intended to “better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come,” according to co-CEO Greg Peters. The update will act as a foundation for ongoing experimentation, allowing the company to “iterate, test, evolve, and improve” its offering over time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the center of the redesign is deeper integration of vertical video feeds, which the streaming giant has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-is-getting-into-short-videos-with-a-new-vertical-feed-for-mobile/\">experimenting</a> with since May. The feed displays short clips from Netflix shows and movies in a format familiar to TikTok and Instagram Reels users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can imagine us bringing more clips based on new content types, like video podcasts,” Peters remarked during the earnings call, further signaling that Netflix sees swipeable short-form clips as a powerful tool for capturing attention and increasing time spent in the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix is also making a significant push into video podcasts — a sector where YouTube has long been the leader. This week, Netflix debuted its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/netflixs-first-original-video-podcasts-feature-pete-davidson-and-michael-irvin/\">first original video podcasts</a>, including shows hosted by high-profile personalities such as Pete Davidson and Michael Irvin. The company has also partnered with major podcast players to bring established video podcast libraries to the platform, including tie-ups with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/netflix-doubles-down-on-video-podcasts-with-iheartmedia-deal/\">iHeartMedia</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both of these moves signal a broader effort to make content discovery and daily engagement on Netflix feel more like a social platform experience. At the same time, Netflix has been careful to position its strategy as experimentation rather than imitation. Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/netflix-cto-says-more-vertical-video-experiments-are-coming-but-streamer-is-not-competing-with-tiktok/\">CTO Elizabeth Stone</a> emphasized that the company isn’t trying to become TikTok, but rather to strengthen its entertainment discovery capabilities through mobile-first features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the earnings call, co-CEO Ted Sarandos reflected on the wider shift in the streaming industry: services are no longer competing only with one another, but with the entire entertainment industry. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s never been more competition for creators, for consumer attention, for advertising and subscription dollars, the competitive lines around TV consumption are already blurring,” Sarandos said. “TV is not what we grew up on. TV is now just about everything. The Oscars and the NFL are on YouTube…Apple’s competing for Emmys and Oscars, and Instagram is coming next.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarandos also commented on Netflix’s evolving film strategy, referencing the company’s recent shift in its theatrical release strategy as it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-in-a-disruptive-deal-valued-at-82-7b/\">prepares to acquire Warner Bros</a>. This signals an openness to hybrid distribution models, as the line between cinema, streaming, and social content continues to blur.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, Netflix delivered $45.2 billion in revenue, with ad revenue rising to over $1.5 billion. Additionally, Netflix crossed the 325 million paid subscriptions milestone in the fourth quarter. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A number of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/openai-denies-allegation-chatgpt-teenagers-death-adam-raine-lawsuit-rcna245946\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">teen suicides</a> have been linked to the chatbot, and, like other AI vendors, OpenAI has also been criticized for allowing ChatGPT to discuss sexual topics with young users. Last April, the company was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/openai-is-fixing-a-bug-that-allowed-minors-to-generate-erotic-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">forced to address a bug</a> that allowed its chatbot to generate erotica for users who were under the age of 18.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has already been working on its underage user problem for some time, and its new “age prediction” feature merely adds to protections already in place. The new feature leverages an AI algorithm that assesses user accounts for particular “behavioral and account-level signals,” in an effort to identify young users, OpenAI said <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-age-prediction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a blog post</a> Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those “signals” include things like the user’s stated age, the length of time an account has existed, and the times of day that the account is usually active, the company said. The company already has content filters designed to weed out discussions of sex, violence, and other potentially problematic topics for users who are under age 18. If the age prediction mechanism identifies an account as under 18, those filters are automatically applied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If a user is mistakenly designated as underage, there is a way for them to reestablish their “adult” account. They can submit a selfie to OpenAI’s ID verification partner Persona, OpenAI says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Musk’s latest comments suggest the strategy has shifted again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The billionaire executive and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/elon-musk-10-million-campaign-donation-kentucky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Republican megadonor</a> said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2013034224828215706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2013034224828215706%7Ctwgr%5E6cb7f7eaf7efe5568175be7fbcf4cf4c874e9a7f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Ftesla-confirms-that-work-on-dojo-3-has-officially-resumed%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on X</a> the decision to revive Dojo was based on the state of its in-house chip roadmap, noting that Tesla’s AI5 chip design was “in good shape.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s AI5 chip, made by TSMC, was designed to power the automaker’s automated driving features and Optimus humanoid robots. Last summer, Tesla signed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/tesla-signs-16-5b-deal-with-samsung-to-make-ai-chips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$16.5 billion deal with Samsung</a> to build its AI6 chips that promise to power Tesla vehicles and Optimus, as well as enable high-performance AI training in data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI7/Dojo3 will be for space-based AI compute,” Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2012756384559817033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2012756384559817033%7Ctwgr%5E6cb7f7eaf7efe5568175be7fbcf4cf4c874e9a7f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Ftesla-confirms-that-work-on-dojo-3-has-officially-resumed%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> on Sunday, positioning the resurrected project as more of a moonshot. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To achieve that, Tesla is now gearing up to rebuild the team it dismantled months ago. Musk used the same post to recruit engineers directly, writing: “If you’re interested in working on what will be the highest volume chips in the world, send a note to AI_Chips@Tesla.com with 3 bullet points on the toughest technical problems you’ve solved.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of the announcement is notable. At CES 2026, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-launches-alpamayo-open-ai-models-that-allow-autonomous-vehicles-to-think-like-a-human/?_thumbnail_id=3079884\">Nvidia unveiled </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-launches-alpamayo-open-ai-models-that-allow-autonomous-vehicles-to-think-like-a-human/?_thumbnail_id=3079884\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alpamayo</a>, an open source AI model for autonomous driving that directly challenges Tesla’s FSD software. Musk commented on X that solving the long tail of rare edge cases in driving is “super hard,” adding: “I honestly hope they succeed.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk and several other AI executives have argued the future of data centers may lie off-planet, since Earth’s power grids are already strained to the max. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/ai-spacex-elon-musk-data-centers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios recently reported</a> Musk rival and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also excited by the prospect of putting data centers into orbit. Musk has an edge over his peers because he already controls the launch vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per Axios, Musk plans to use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/spacex-reportedly-planning-2026-ipo-with-1-5t-valuation-target/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SpaceX’s upcoming IPO</a> to help finance his vision of using Starship to launch a constellation of compute satellites that can operate in constant sunlight, harvesting solar power 24/7. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, there are many roadblocks to making AI data centers in space a possibility, not least the challenge of cooling high-power compute in a vacuum. Musk’s comments of Tesla building “space-based AI compute” fit a familiar pattern: float an idea that sounds far-fetched, then try to brute-force it into reality. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In those days, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk had only recently acquired the platform, and he claimed to be on a mission to restructure the social media platform to make it more transparent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the algorithm’s code release was swiftly critiqued for being “<a href=\"https://csmapnyu.org/impact/news/twitter-s-transparency-theater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">transparency theater</a>,” with critics noting that it was “incomplete,” and that it didn’t reveal much about the inner workings of the organization, or why the code worked the way that it did.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the site (rebranded as X) has open sourced its algorithm again, fulfilling a promise made by Musk last week. “We will make the new 𝕏 algorithm, including all code used to determine what organic and advertising posts are recommended to users, open source in 7 days,” <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2010062264976736482\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">he’d said</a>.

The <a href=\"https://github.com/xai-org/x-algorithm?tab=readme-ov-file#home-mixer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">diagram</a> shows that, when sifting about for content to feed a particular user, the site’s algorithm considers their engagement history (what posts they’ve clicked on, etc.) and surveys recent in-network posts. It also conducts a machine-learning-based analysis of “out-of-network” posts — as in, content from accounts that the user doesn’t necessarily follow — that it believes the user might also find appealing.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083989\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png 1562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=768,289 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=680,256 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=1200,452 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=1280,482 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=430,162 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=720,271 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=900,339 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=800,301 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=1536,578 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=668,251 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=1440,542 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=708,267 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.21.08-AM.png?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The algorithm then filters out certain kinds of posts, including ones that come from blocked accounts or that are associated with muted keywords, as well as content that has been deemed too violent or spam-like. The algorithm then ranks this content based on what it thinks the user will find most appealing. This process considers factors like relevance and content diversity so users don’t just get a bunch of posts that are all alike. The algorithm also considers content according to the likelihood that the user will like it, reply to it, repost it, favorite it, or otherwise engage with it in some way.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084033\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png 1738w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=768,363 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=680,322 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=1200,568 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=1280,605 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=430,203 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=720,341 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=900,426 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=800,378 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=1536,726 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=668,316 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=1305,617 1305w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=708,335 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.47.14-AM.png?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This whole system is AI-based, according to X. The GitHub write-up released Tuesday notes that the system “relies entirely” on the company’s “Grok-based transformer” to “learn relevance from user engagement sequences.” In other words, Grok is looking at what you’re clicking and liking and feeding that information into the recommendation system. The write-up also notes that there is no “manual feature engineering for content relevance,” meaning humans don’t manually adjust how the algorithm determines what’s relevant. It adds that the automation “significantly reduces the complexity in our data pipelines and serving infrastructure.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why is X revealing all of this now? It’s not totally clear. In the past, Musk has claimed that he wants to make the platform an exemplar of corporate transparency — a theme that continues to today. In 2023, when the Twitter algorithm was first revealed, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1636838845894279168\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said that</a> providing “code transparency” would be “incredibly embarrassing at first” but would ultimately “lead to rapid improvement in recommendation quality.” He added: “Most importantly, we hope to earn your trust.” With its first code open sourcing, the platform proclaimed a “<a href=\"https://blog.x.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/a-new-era-of-transparency-for-twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new era of transparency</a>” for Twitter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Musk has talked transparency, certain aspects of the platform have arguably grown less open since Musk took it over. When the tech billionaire bought Twitter in 2022, the site was notably forced to transition from a public company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/technology/twitter-changes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to a private one</a> — an evolution that isn’t typically synonymous with openness. While the site used to release <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/x-twitter-first-transparency-report-since-elon-musks-takeover-is-finally-here/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">multiple transparency reports a year</a>, X didn’t release its <a href=\"https://transparency.x.com/content/dam/transparency-twitter/2024/x-global-transparency-report-h1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first transparency report</a> until September of 2024. In December, X was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-fine-x-120-million-euro-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also fined $140 million</a> by European Union regulators who claimed that the site had violated “transparency obligations” under the Digital Services Act (DSA), and argued that the site’s verification check mark system had made it more difficult for users to judge the authenticity of particular accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X has also been under pressure over the past month due to the ways in which its chatbot, Grok, have been used to create and distribute sexualized content. The California Attorney General’s office and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/us-senators-demand-answers-from-x-meta-alphabet-on-sexualized-deepfakes/\">congressional lawmakers</a> have both scrutinized the platform in recent weeks, citing claims that Grok has been used to create naked images of women and minors. As a result, some may view this appeal to openness <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/860294/elon-musk-open-source-x-algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as just more theater</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Representatives for his new venture, Russell AI Labs, have told TechCrunch that he remains interested in submitting a bid for Luminar’s lidar assets, but a formal offer has not yet been submitted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar has been seeking information from Russell since his resignation as it decides whether to take legal action against him. The founder has already turned over multiple computers but held on to his phone because of privacy concerns. (Luminar originally claimed it was seeking two phones from Russell, one provided by the company and one personal.

The deal values Diligent’s common stock at $29 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Diligent Robotics was founded in 2017 by Andrea Thomaz and Vivian Chu and has raised more than $75 million in venture capital — most recently raising a <a href=\"https://www.diligentrobots.com/blog/diligent-robotics-closes-25-million-to-advance-systemwide-expansions-of-socially-intelligent-service-robots-empower-healthcare-professionals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$25 million funding round in 2023</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition marks Serve’s first foray beyond its food-delivery roots. The sidewalk delivery robots company was incubated inside food delivery company Postmates in 2017. The project continued after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber bought Postmates</a>, before spinning off in 2021. Serve went <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/uber-nvidia-backed-serve-robotics-hits-public-markets-with-40m-splash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">public in April 2024 via a reverse merger</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Serve co-founder and CEO Ali Kashani doesn’t view the acquisition as a big deviation from the company’s initial target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company hasn’t focused specifically on healthcare thus far, how Diligent’s robot Moxi operates does fit squarely into the company’s thesis around last-mile delivery and robots that can navigate alongside humans, Kashani told TechCrunch in a recent interview. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a kind of a classic example of a prepared mind meets opportunity,” Kashani said. “Robots that are moving among people is the broader opportunity for us. Once you solve the problem, which is how to get robots to seamlessly move among people as autonomous machines, then you can bring it to a lot of other environments. We knew that we wanted to do this someday.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Healthcare wasn’t a specific goal for expansion either, Kashani said, but rather the companies were introduced at the perfect time. Diligent was looking to scale and Serve was opportunistically looking into new areas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We love the team; they have very similar DNA to us, which is, rather than building in a lab, they build in real life,” Kashani said. “It just seems like it’s really aligned with our mission.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Diligent will continue to operate relatively independently within Serve, Kashani said. Diligent will tap into Serve’s software and tools to help them work toward scale and the companies will share tech and collaborate, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kashani said this isn’t a pivot for the company, nor does it mean that Serve is looking to acquire more startups, he added. Kashani, who emphasized that Serve is still very focused on its sidewalk-delivery robots, said they would “keep our eyes open” for interesting companies as potential partners, not necessarily acquisition targets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Serve was able to grow its fleet of robots in 2025 from 100 to more than 2,000, he said. The company also signed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/doordash-to-use-serve-robotics-sidewalk-robots-for-deliveries-in-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnership with DoorDash</a> to facilitate some of their deliveries in Los Angeles in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our sidewalk business is what’s fueling everything,” Kashani said. “It’s creating the technology. It’s one of the largest autonomous fleets in the world right now and developing that helps us create everything that we need in other applications.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
