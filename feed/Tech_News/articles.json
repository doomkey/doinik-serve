So says Phoenix Peng, who has founded not one, but two BCI startups. He’s a co-founder of NeuroXess, maker of BCI implants, as well as founder and CEO of noninvasive ultrasound BCI startup Gestala.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His belief in the potential of this market is founded on concrete action: Provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Zhejiang have already <a href=\"https://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/news/unlocking-minds-chinas-bci-revolution-and-opportunities-uk-collaboration#:~:text=Sichuan%20&amp;%20Shandong:%20Prioritise%20patient%2D,strong%20hospital%20and%20university%20partnerships.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">set medical service pricing</a> for BCI, speeding its inclusion in the national medical insurance system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, he foresees the technology extending beyond medicine “treating disease” to “human augmentation,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have always maintained that neuroscience and AI are two sides of the same coin. They are destined for deep integration, realizing direct high-bandwidth connections between the human brain and AI. BCI will serve as the ultimate bridge between carbon-based and silicon-based intelligence. While this may sound distant, it represents an unimaginably vast market in the future,” Peng said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-four-factors-driving-bci-in-china\">Four factors driving BCI in China</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But over the next three to five years, BCI use is likely to stay concentrated in healthcare, with the market reaching multibillion-dollar scale as insurance coverage expands, Peng told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In August 2025, China’s industry ministry and six other agencies <a href=\"https://english.www.gov.cn/policies/policywatch/202508/22/content_WS68a7dd8dc6d0868f4e8f5027.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released a national roadmap</a> to further speed development of BCIs. The plan targets major technical milestones by 2027, common industry standards, and a full supply chain by 2030, with the goal of building globally competitive BCI companies and supporting smaller specialized firms.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked what’s driving China’s rapid progress in BCI, Peng told TechCrunch it comes down to four factors. The first one is strong policy support, with cross-department collaboration that aligns technical standards and medical reimbursement. In December, at the 2025 Shenzhen BCI &amp; Human-Computer Interaction Expo, China <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-12-30/China-showcases-advances-in-brain-computer-interface-BCI-technology-1JwnhJS055S/p.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> an 11.6 billion yuan ($165 million) brain science fund to support BCI companies from research through commercialization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second factor is vast clinical resources, including large patient pools and lower research costs that accelerate trials. China’s national health insurance means quicker commercialization once the state approves a device. This compares to the U.S. where even after the FDA approves a device, private insurers, as the main payers, must each individually do so. Europe is known for applying the strictest approval standards in healthcare tech, with an emphasis on regulation of data privacy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Researchers have completed the country’s first fully implanted, wireless BCI trial — only the second globally — allowing a paralyzed patient to control devices without external hardware, <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-12-30/China-showcases-advances-in-brain-computer-interface-BCI-technology-1JwnhJS055S/p.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per CGTN</a>. Neuralink is the startup that <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/updates/prime-study-progress-update/#:~:text=At%20a%20high%20level%2C%20the,Barrow%20for%20the%20PRIME%20Study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">completed</a> the <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/updates/a-year-of-telepathy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first such trial</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In traditional electrical BCIs, Chinese firms have achieved clinical progress in motor and language decoding, spinal cord reconstruction, and stroke rehabilitation, with over 50 flexible implantable BCI clinical trials completed by mid-2025,” Peng said, adding that next-generation efforts are now moving toward whole-brain neural decoding and encoding, including ultrasound-based approaches such as <a href=\"https://www.gestala.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gestala</a>’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third factor is China’s mature industrial manufacturing, Peng points out, spanning semiconductors, AI, and medical hardware, which supports fast R&amp;D and prototyping. Finally, there is strategic investment in the market, with both state-led funds and private capital surging under national initiatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some recent key deals include Shanghai-based BCI startup <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/neuralink-rival-stairmed-secures-largest-093000669.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">StairMed</a> Technology raising $48 million (350 million yuan) in Series B funding in February 2025. BrainCo, a neurotech company developing its noninvasive BCIs and bionic limbs, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/-hangzhou-six-tech-startup-brainco-is-said-to-file-for-hong-kong-ipo?srnd=phx-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has also quietly</a> filed for a Hong Kong IPO, according to reports, after raising <a href=\"https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1853748528402714980&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$287 million (2 billion yuan)</a> earlier this year. Peng’s company Gestala, which launched in January, is in talks with investors to close an angel round soon, he tells us. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All told, China’s BCI startups are ramping up to challenge U.S. leaders like Neuralink, Synchron, and Paradromics. Among <a href=\"https://tracxn.com/d/explore/brain-computer-interface-startups-in-china/__BwVEyDnGferH2QCKKgOFDVKmMEJhkQk26x2Przifo14/companies#t-3-aoyi-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the most active players</a> in China are NeuroXess, Neuracle, NeuralMatrix, BrainCo, Bo Rui Kang Tech, Aoyi Tech, Brainland Tech, and Zhiran Medical. They span approaches from implantable flexible interfaces to noninvasive brain-computer technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means that China’s BCI market was expected to grow to more than $530 million (3.8 billion yuan) in 2025, up from 3.2 billion yuan in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202511/1348228.shtml#:~:text=China's%20BCI%20market%20is%20expected,2040%2C%20according%20to%20media%20report.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to media reports</a>, <a href=\"https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-brain-computer-interface-industry-tapping-into-the-future-of-human-machine-integration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with projections</a> putting the market at over 120 billion yuan by 2040.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bci-types\"><strong>BCI types</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">BCIs are taking two paths. The first is invasive electrophysiological BCIs like NeuroXess and Neuralink that implant electrodes in people’s brains for precise neuron-level signals. But this type comes with surgery risks. The second type is noninvasive systems like <a href=\"https://neurosky.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NeuroSky</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/-hangzhou-six-tech-startup-brainco-is-said-to-file-for-hong-kong-ipo?srnd=phx-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BrainCo</a> that trade some precision for safety and ease of use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The field is now broadening further, with emerging approaches — including ultrasound, magnetoencephalography imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, optical methods, and hybrid BCIs — giving researchers new tools to read and influence brain activity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startup founders also hope that noninvasive technology could help overcome adoption barriers. Not everyone is willing to undergo brain surgery to have a device implanted in their heads.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultrasound BCIs from companies like <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/investing-in-merge-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI-backed Merge Labs</a> and Gestala are targeting high-prevalence conditions such as chronic pain, stroke, and depression. As noninvasive solutions, these technologies are more readily accepted by patients and offer significantly greater commercial scalability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gestala, for instance, expects to roll out its first-generation product by Q3, its founder said. Early clinical trials have shown promising results: A single session reduced pain scores by 50%, with effects lasting one to two weeks, Peng noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HongShan Capital, formerly Sequoia China, has invested in Zhiran Medical, a startup founded in 2022 focused on improving long-term implant performance. The company uses flexible, high-throughput electrodes to reduce inflammation and signal loss associated with rigid implants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some technologies may look cutting-edge but far from practical application,” Yang Yunxia, a partner at HongShan Capital, <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5iZA4PokWGqK1R8LOW93-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a blog post</a>. While others appear commercially viable, they face “high costs” or significant technical barriers, Yunxia contends. Ultimately, investment decisions come down to whether the investor believes a product can be developed into a sustainable business, the partner noted.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-years-ahead\">The years ahead </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the next five years, industry insiders expect China’s BCI regulations to align more closely with international standards, with a particular focus on regulatory approval and data sovereignty. Global frameworks developed by organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/blog/want-find-out-more-about-brain-computer-interfaces#:~:text=Among%20the%20topics%20broached%20will,relation%20to%20IEC%20International%20Standards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IEC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/committee/9082407.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ISO</a>, along with guidance from the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11951885/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA</a>), are expected to serve as key reference points. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chinese regulators are also expected to tighten oversight of invasive devices, as well as the data that all BCI devices generate, while easing approval for noninvasive technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11085839/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">As for the ethics</a> that confront brain-implanted or manipulating devices, China plans to strengthen informed-consent requirements, broaden ethics review beyond medicine, and move toward unified technical standards for clinical evaluation.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Before you continue, note that I’m not a professional car reviewer. TechCrunch has excellent transportation writers; I am not one of them. I do, however, drive an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/bmw-i-am-so-breaking-up-with-you/\">electric car</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I was immediately game. I’d first glimpsed one last summer at a car show, where some regional car dealers had stationed themselves at the end of a long field dotted with exquisite vintage automobiles. My immediate reaction was “Jesus, that’s enormous,” followed by a surprising admiration for its design, which, despite its enormous scale, shows restraint. For lack of a better word, I’m going to say it’s “strapping.” Its proportions just work.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My excitement waned pretty quickly when the car was dropped off at my house a day before our departure time. This thing is a monstrosity — at 228.5 inches long and 94.1 inches wide, it made our own cars look like toys. My first apartment in San Francisco was smaller. Trying to drive it up my driveway was a little harrowing, too; it’s so big, and its hood is so high, that if you’re ascending a road at a certain slope – we live midway down a hill; our mailbox is at the top of it – you can’t see whatever is directly in front of the car.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I thought about just leaving it in the driveway for the duration of the trip. The other alternative was doing what I could to grow more comfortable with the prospect of driving it 200 miles to Tahoe City, so I tooled around in it that night and the next day, picking up dinner, heading to an exercise class — just basic stuff around town. When I ran into a friend on the street, I volunteered as quickly as possible that this was not my new car, that I was going to possibly review it, and wasn’t its size ridiculous? It felt like a tank. I thought: other than hotels that use SUVs like the Escalade to ferry guests around, what kind of monster chooses a car like this?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Five days later, it turns out that I am that kind of monster.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095472\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png 1752w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=768,545 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=680,483 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=1200,852 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=1280,909 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=430,305 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=720,511 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=900,639 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=800,568 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=1536,1091 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=668,474 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=528,375 528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=869,617 869w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=708,503 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.00.21-AM.png?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Look, I don’t know how or when I fell for this car. If I’d written this review after two days, it would read very differently. Even now, I’m not so blind that I don’t see its shortcomings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was the Escalade’s performance in a terrible snowstorm that really won my heart, but let me walk you through the steps between “Ugh, this car is a tank” and “Yes! This car is a <em>tank</em>.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just getting into it requires a little more exertion than would seem to make sense. I’m fairly athletic and I still found myself wondering if this thing shouldn’t come with an automated step stool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inside is where digital maximalism does its work. The dashboard opens with a 55-inch curved LED screen with 8K resolution that reads less like a car display and more like a situation room. Front passengers get their own screens. Second-row passengers also get 12.6-inch personal screens along with stowable tray tables, dual wireless chargers, and — with the most lavish version of the car — massage seats that will make them forget they’re in a vehicle at all. Google Maps handles navigation. And the polarized screen technology deserves its own praise: while one of my kids binge-watched Hulu in the front seat, not a frame of it leaked into my sightline from behind the wheel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cabin itself is built around the premise that no one inside should feel crowded, and it delivers. Front legroom stretches to 45.2 inches; the second row offers 41.3; even the third row manages 32.3 inches. Seven adults could share this machine for a long while without fraying each other’s nerves. Heated and ventilated leather seats with 14-way power adjustment come standard in the first two rows, and the whole operation runs on 5G Wi-Fi. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The car also comes standard with Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free driving system, which I’m not sure I quite figured out. True car reviewers seem to love it; when I tried it, the car felt like it was drifting to an alarming degree between the outer boundaries of the highway lane, and when that happens, it unleashes an escalating sequence of warnings. First, a red steering wheel icon materializes on-screen. Then your seat pulses haptic warnings against your rump. Ignore those and a chime — both reminder and reproach — fills the cabin. GM calls this impolite series a “driver takeover request.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Did I mention the 38-speaker AKG Studio sound system? So good.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the exterior — this is a handsome giant, but it takes some getting used to. At first, I found the grille, which is just for show, almost comically imposing. This is definitely a car for people who are the boss, or want to be the boss, or want to look like the boss while privately dealing with existential crises. Pulling up to a glass-lined restaurant one night, I’m pretty sure I blinded half the patrons as I swung into a parking spot perpendicular to the building, the Escalade’s headlights flooding through the windows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there is the light show the car launches whenever it detects you approaching via the key or the MyCadillac app. It’s as if it’s saying, “Hey, chief, where we headed?” before you’ve so much as touched a door handle. (In the vernacular of Cadillac, this is thanks to its “advanced, all-LED exterior lighting system,” highlighted by a “crystal shield” illuminated grille and crest, along with vertical LED headlamps and “choreography-capable tail lamps.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is, objectively, a bit much. I loved it immediately.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095476\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png 1464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=768,641 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=680,568 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=1200,1002 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=1280,1068 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=430,359 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=720,601 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=900,751 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=800,668 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=668,558 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=449,375 449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=739,617 739w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=636,531 636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.21.47-AM.png?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its size, the Escalade IQL is unexpectedly nimble. Not “sports car darting through traffic” nimble, but “I can’t quite believe something this colossal doesn’t handle like a battleship” nimble.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now we arrive at the frustrations. The front trunk — or “frunk” in the lexicon of EV devotees — operates in mysterious and frustrating ways. Opening requires holding the button until completion. Release prematurely and it halts mid-ascent, frozen in automotive purgatory, forcing you to restart the entire sequence. Closing demands the same sustained pressure. The rear trunk, conversely, requires two distinct taps followed by immediate button abandonment. Hold too long and nothing happens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relatedly, twice, the vehicle refused to power down after I’d finished driving. The car simply sat there, running, even when shifted to park and opened the door (which tells the car to turn off). One clunky solution: open the frunk, close the frunk, shift into drive, then park, then exit entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the software, it’s absolutely fine unless you’ve owned a Tesla, in which case, prepare for disappointment. This seems to be true across the board — everyone I know who owns both a Tesla and another EV, no matter how high end, says the same thing. Once you’ve internalized how effortlessly Tesla’s software dissolves barriers between intention and execution, every other automaker’s software feels like a compromise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Which brings us to the nadir of the trip: charging in Tahoe during winter. For all its virtues, the Escalade IQL is, by any measure, a thirsty machine. The battery is a 205 kWh pack — enormous, and it needs to be, because the car burns through roughly 45 kWh per 100 miles, which is considerably more than comparable electric SUVs. Cadillac estimates 460 miles of range on a full charge, and in ideal conditions that holds up. Tahoe in winter, however, is not ideal conditions. We’d also arrived with less charge than we should have. A series of side trips on the way up, including an emergency detour to find shirts for a family member who had packed none, had eaten into the battery more than expected. By the time we needed to charge, we genuinely needed to charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We approached a Tesla Supercharger in Tahoe City that appeared on the MyCadillac app, but when we plugged in to the designated stall, nothing happened. We searched for answers, discovering that even Tesla stations that accept non-Tesla vehicles throttle energy to 6 kilowatts per hour anyway, but it was a frustrating experience. A nearby EVGo had shuttered a month prior. ChargePoint’s two units at the Tahoe City Public Utility lot were, respectively, broken and willing to connect but not to actually charge anything. We briefly contemplated a 35-mile drive to Incline Village, did the math on what stranded would actually look like, and decided against it. Then I discovered an Electrify America station 12 miles away. We drove through gathering snow, arrived shortly before 11 p.m., and it worked. We sat there for an hour fighting exhaustion before driving home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The following morning revealed another issue via an app alert: tire pressure had dropped to 53 and 56 PSI in the front (recommended: 61) and 62 PSI in the rear (recommended: 68). I have no idea whether the car had been delivered that way or whether something else was going on — either way, it meant someone standing at a gas station filling tires while being pelted directly in the face with ice. (That someone was my husband.) The tires held steady after that, even as the week kept doing its worst. For a family trip, it was going great.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this point, in fact, I would have told you that the Escalade IQL is unquestionably luxurious and ideal for families of four or more who value space and technology. I would tell you it came burdened by real tradeoffs: forward visibility obstructed by its commanding hood, parking challenges inherent to its dimensions, limited charging infrastructure for a machine this ravenous, and tires tasked with supporting 9,000 pounds. It’s a beautiful car, I would have said, but it’s not for me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the snow that had started to fall kept falling. Within two days, eight feet had accumulated, making it impossible to ski — the entire point of the trip — and terrifying to drive. Except I found that I wasn’t terrified because we had the Escalade, which, because of its weight, felt like driving a tank through the snow. What could have been harrowing felt serene. It was quiet, it was strong, it was taking charge in a bad situation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I also adjusted to the size. By the end of this past week I had stopped mouthing “I’m sorry” to whoever who was waiting for me to figure out where to park it. I had stopped caring what it said about me that I was driving a car whose entire design philosophy is: the owner of this vehicle is not waiting in line. Eight feet of snow had fallen, we needed groceries, and I was the one with the tank, suckers! I could sense my husband falling for the car, too. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095473\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png 1892w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=768,524 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=680,464 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=1200,819 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=1280,874 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=430,294 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=720,492 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=900,615 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=800,546 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=1536,1049 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=668,456 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=549,375 549w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=904,617 904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=708,483 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-22-at-2.07.37-AM.png?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, as tends to happen in Tahoe, the snow stopped all at once and the sun came out, and the Escalade was just a very dirty car sitting in the driveway (sorry, GM!).

Like Apple’s App Store, alternative app marketplaces on allow for easy access to a wider world of apps on Apple devices, but instead of the apps going through Apple’s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110#notarization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">notarization process</a> to ensure they meet some “baseline platform integrity standards,” <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apple says</a> — like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple’s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includes <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#distribution-eu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">paying a new Core Technology Fee of €0.50</a> for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple’s DMA business terms. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple’s walls. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the EU, other markets are experimenting with alternative app stores, as well, like Japan. In December 2025, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/\">Apple announced its compliance</a> with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which gives developers new options to distribute apps and process payments outside of Apple’s App Store. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This option also requires developers to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/\">accept new business terms</a>, like a reduced 10% to 21% App Store commission, a payment processing fee for Apple in-app purchases of 5%, a core technology fee of 5%, and a 15% store services commission on web sales made through a link in the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in these markets can try today. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-altstore-pal-eu\">AltStore PAL (EU)</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"AltStore screenshot on iPhone\" class=\"wp-image-3054927\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg 3376w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=1200,628 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=1280,670 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=720,377 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=900,471 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=800,418 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=2048,1071 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=668,349 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=1179,617 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=708,370 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>AltStore</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator app <a href=\"https://deltaemulator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Delta</a>, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU.

Unfortunately, this app store didn’t last long — the company announced it would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/863978/setapp-mobile-ios-store-shutdown\">sunset the Setapp Mobile service</a> on February 16, 2026.

The company cited Apple’s “still-evolving” and complex business terms as the reason for its decision.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company had long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac.

Similar to its other subscription offerings, the now-shuttered app store had included dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grew over time. The apps were free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality. However, it didn’t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix, and others. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-epic-games-store-eu\">Epic Games Store (EU)</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Learn How to Install the Epic Games Store on iOS in the EU\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6cmu0NuM3g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fortnite maker Epic Games <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/16/fortnite-maker-epic-games-launches-its-app-store-on-ios-in-the-eu-worldwide-on-android/\">launched its alternative iOS app store</a> in the EU in August 2024, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come.

Data centers have also been connected to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\">rising electricity prices</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Citing a previous conversation with Bill Gates, the interviewer asked whether it’s accurate to say a single ChatGPT query currently uses the equivalent of 1.5 iPhone battery charges, to which Altman replied, “There’s no way it’s anything close to that much.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman also complained that many discussions about ChatGPT’s energy usage are “unfair,” especially when they focus on “how much energy it takes to train an AI model, relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human,” Altman said. “It takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart. And not only that, it took the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to figure out science and whatever, to produce you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So in his view, the fair comparison is, “If you ask ChatGPT a question, how much energy does it take once its model is trained to answer that question versus a human? And probably, AI has already caught up on an energy efficiency basis, measured that way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can watch the full interview below. The conversation about water and energy usage begins at around 26:35.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sam Altman Unfiltered: ChatGPT, AI Risks &amp; What’s Coming Next, 40 Questions in 60 Minutes\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qH7thwrCluM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That also makes it useful as a source for Wikipedia citations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Archive.is_RFC_5#\">the Wikipedia discussion page about this topic</a>, “There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist […] and to forthwith remove all links to it.” (Ars Technica <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-bans-archive-today-after-site-executed-ddos-and-altered-web-captures/\">first reported on the decision</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The discussion page says that Archive.today was previously blacklisted in 2013, only to be removed from the blacklist in 2016.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why reverse course again? Because, the discussion page says, “Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack.” Plus, “evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in question was allegedly directed at blogger Jani Patokallio. Patokallio wrote that beginning on January 11, users who loaded the archive’s CAPTCHA page have been <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gyrovague.com/2026/02/01/archive-today-is-directing-a-ddos-attack-against-my-blog/\">unknowingly loading and executing JavaScript</a> that sends a search request to his Gyrovague blog, in an apparent attempt to get Patokallio’s attention and increase his hosting bill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Back in 2023, Patokallio published <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gyrovague.com/2023/08/05/archive-today-on-the-trail-of-the-mysterious-guerrilla-archivist-of-the-internet/\">a blog post</a> examining Archive.today, whose ownership he described as “an opaque mystery.” And while he wasn’t able to track down a specific owner, he concluded the site was likely “a one-person labor of love, operated by a Russian of considerable talent and access to Europe.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More recently, Patokallio said the webmaster at Archive.today asked him to take the post down for two or three months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience,” the webmaster said, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pastes.io/correspond\">emails shared by Patokallio</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Patokallio said that after he declined to take the post down, the webmaster responded with “an increasingly unhinged series of threats.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wikipedia editors also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Archive.is_RFC_5#Evidence_of_altering_snapshots\">pointed to webpage snapshots</a> in Archive.today that appeared to have been altered to insert Patokallio’s name — hence the concern that it’s become “unreliable” as an archive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wikipedia’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Archive.today_guidance\">guidance</a> now calls for editors to remove links to Archive.today and related sites, replacing them with links to the original source or to other archives like the Wayback Machine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lj.rossia.org/users/archive_today/\">a blog</a> linked from the Archive.today website, the site’s apparent owner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lj.rossia.org/users/archive_today/2567.html?mode=reply\">wrote</a> that Archive.today’s value to Wikipedia was “not about paywalls” but rather “the ability to offload copyright issues.” They later <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lj.rossia.org/users/archive_today/3500.html?mode=reply\">wrote</a> that things had turned out “pretty well” and said they would “scale down the ‘DDoS’.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Why didn’t you write about such events earlier, folks of the tabloids?” they said. “I don’t expect you to write anything good, because then who would read you, but there was plenty of dramas, wasn’t there? Because there was no Jani to nudge you?”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The generative AI boom minted a startup a minute. But as the dust starts to settle, two once-hot business models are looking more like cautionary tales: LLM wrappers and AI aggregators. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Darren Mowry, who leads Google’s global startup organization across Cloud, DeepMind, and Alphabet, says startups with these hooks have their “check engine light” on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LLM wrappers are essentially startups that wrap existing large language models, like Claude, GPT, or Gemini, with a product or UX layer to solve a specific problem. An example would be a startup that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://community.openai.com/t/openai-why-are-you-killing-my-startup-for-the-second-time/1355491\">uses AI to help students study</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re really just counting on the back-end model to do all the work and you’re almost white-labeling that model, the industry doesn’t have a lot of patience for that anymore,” Mowry said on this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/google-clouds-vp-for-startups-on-reading-your-check-engine-light-before-its-too-late/\">week’s episode of Equity</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wrapping “very thin intellectual property around Gemini or GPT-5” signals you’re not differentiating yourself, Mowry says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve got to have deep, wide moats that are either horizontally differentiated or something really specific to a vertical market” for a startup to “progress and grow,” he said. Examples of the deep-moat LLM wrapper type include Cursor, a GPT-powered coding assistant, or Harvey AI, a legal AI assistant.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, startups can no longer expect to slap a UI on top of a GPT and get traction on their product like they could, perhaps, in mid-2024 when OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/openai-launches-a-store-for-custom-ai-powered-chatbots/\">launched its ChatGPT store</a>. The challenge now is to build sustainable product value. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI aggregators are a subset of wrappers — they’re startups that aggregate multiple LLMs into one interface or API layer to route queries across models and give users access to multiple models. These companies typically provide an orchestration layer that includes monitoring, governance, or eval tooling. Think: AI search startup Perplexity or developer platform OpenRouter, which provides access to multiple AI models via a single API. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many of these platforms have gained ground, Mowry’s message is clear to incoming startups: “Stay out of the aggregator business.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Generally speaking, aggregators aren’t seeing much growth or progression these days because, he says, users want “some intellectual property built in” to ensure they’re routed to the right model at the right time based on their needs — not because of behind-the-scenes compute or access constraints.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mowry has been in the cloud game for decades, cutting his teeth at AWS and Microsoft before setting up shop at Google Cloud, and he’s seen how this plays out. He said the situation today mirrors the early days of cloud computing in the late 2000s/early 2010s as Amazon’s cloud business started taking off. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that time, a crop of startups sprang up to resell AWS infrastructure, marketing themselves as easier entry points that provided tooling, billing consolidation, and support. But when Amazon built its own enterprise tools and customers learned to manage cloud services directly, most of those startups were squeezed out. The only survivors were the ones that added real services, like security, migration, or DevOps consulting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI aggregators today face similar margin pressure as model providers expand into enterprise features themselves, potentially sidelining middlemen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For his part, Mowry is bullish on vibe coding and developer platforms, which had a record-breaking year in 2025 with startups like Replit, Lovable, and Cursor (all Google Cloud customers, per Mowry) attracting major investment and customer traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mowry also expects strong growth in direct-to-consumer tech, in companies that put some of these powerful AI tools into the hands of customers. He pointed to the opportunity for film and TV students to use Google’s AI video generator Veo to bring stories to life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond AI, Mowry also thinks biotech and climate tech are having a moment — both in terms of venture investment going into the two industries and the “incredible amounts of data” startups can access to create real value “in ways we would never have been able to before.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

An OpenAI spokesperson said Van Rootselaar’s activity did not meet the criteria for reporting to law enforcement; the company reached out to Canadian authorities after the incident.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. “We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT transcripts weren’t the only concerning part of Van Rootselaar’s digital footprint. She apparently created a game on Roblox, the world simulation platform frequented by children, which simulated a mass shooting at a mall. She also posted about guns on Reddit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Van Rootselaar’s instability was also known to local police, who had been called to her family’s home after she started a fire while under the influence of unspecified drugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LLM chatbots built by OpenAI and its competitors have been accused of triggering mental breakdowns in users who lose grip on reality while conversing with digital models. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/\">Multiple</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-lawsuit-colordo-man-suicide-openai-sam-altman/\">lawsuits</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/openai-chatgpt-suicide-lawsuit-invs-vis\">have</a> been filed that cite chat transcripts that encourage people to commit suicide or offer assistance in doing so.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you are in a crisis or having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This post has been updated with comment from OpenAI.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Where do I know you from?” someone asks, as though Rogowsky could be a friend of a friend they had met at a party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know your face,” another person says, staring thoughtfully at the 41-year-old.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A cosplayer dressed as a Ghostbuster finally figures it out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Did you used to do that game show online?” he asks. “Like, every night?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogowsky was just poking fun at himself, embracing the persona of a washed-up internet sensation. “I know my place,” he tells TechCrunch. “I’m not walking around like everybody’s supposed to know who I am.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But seven years ago, everyone did. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogowsky was once the face of HQ Trivia, an app that exploded into popular culture, then faded out of the public consciousness almost as fast. Between 2017 and 2019, Rogowsky hosted the live mobile game show twice a day. At its peak, it drew more than 2.4 million daily viewers each night. It garnered 20 million lifetime downloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the comedian is back with an app of his own called Savvy, which shares a lot of the DNA of HQ. Savvy’s first game, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/savvy-words-puzzles-live/id6748058412\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TextSavvy,</a> is a daily live game show where players can earn cash — only this time, viewers are competing against Rogowsky in a word puzzle game that’s something like a hybrid of The New York Times’ Wordle and Connections, rather than trivia. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe this is my calling in a weird way,” Rogowsky says. “I get up there in front of that camera, there’s thousands of people watching at home — millions, back in the HQ days — and it just flows.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title='Introducing... \"TextSavvy\" with Scott Rogowsky' src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/06JIcqpfqJU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-i-have-more-to-do-here\">‘I have more to do here’</h1>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HQ Trivia was founded by the creators of Vine — the short-video platform that predated TikTok — and became a genuine cultural sensation. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZg75Q-FFqc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">National news</a> channels <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oOwRfxJpdY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ran stories</a> about office workers dropping everything in the middle of the day to play HQ at 3 p.m. It was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGi3DBh0rA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">groundbreaking</a> — appointment entertainment in a new format for the streaming era — until the company imploded in a barrage of unfortunate circumstances. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One founder, Colin Kroll, died of a drug overdose; the other founder, Rus Yusupov, was a divisive leader who clashed with his staff. He once <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ceo-of-hq-the-hottest-app-going-if-you-run-this-profile-well-fire-our-host/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">threatened a journalist</a> that he would fire Rogowsky if she published an interview with Rogowsky where he mentioned liking Sweetgreen salads (Yusupov apparently didn’t want to give the fast-food chain free publicity). Most of all, HQ Trivia fell victim to the same trap that dooms so many startups. The company had raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/06/hq-trivia-questions/\">$15 million funding round</a> at a $100 million valuation, but it was — quite literally — giving away money, and it never developed a meaningful plan to monetize or build a sustainable business model. The company ultimately filed for bankruptcy in February 2020, with its demise later becoming fodder for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch%3A_The_Rise_%26_Fall_of_HQ_Trivia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dramatic documentaries</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2020/05/20/pop-culture/hq-trivia-rise-fall-viral-sensation-episode-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">true-crime-adjacent podcasts</a> dissecting how such a promising app failed so spectacularly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was, understandably, a real blow for Rogowsky. But more bad luck followed. A baseball superfan, Rogowsky had left HQ Trivia in 2019 for a job hosting <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-dazn-agree-to-3-year-digital-rights-deal-c300774598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a daily MLB Network show</a>. He felt like he finally made it — he still lights up recalling running into Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez in the bathroom. But his show was canceled when the pandemic shut down baseball. He tried a handful of times over the years to recreate a company like HQ, but it was a journey of false starts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Crazy s–t happened that I had no control over, and I felt like I was being tossed and turned on this raft in the ocean, just getting battered by things I can’t control, and that was sort of my attitude about life in general,” he says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He considered himself retired from show business and opened a vintage store in California. But he missed comedy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I went through this very meaningful personal transformation in the last couple of years,” he said. That process culminated in a seven-day mountain retreat called “the Hoffman Process,” a program that he describes as a digital detox combining lessons in psychology and neuroscience that helped him “take control of [his] life again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It gave me a lot of clarity to say, you know what, I have more to do here,” Rogowsky says. “I got out of that retreat and I was like, ‘I have something to say. People find me funny and entertaining. I find myself funny and entertaining.’”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People tuned into HQ Trivia for the prospect of winning a cash prize, but the odds of winning were slim. Millions of viewers came back each night because of Rogowsky’s quick wit and charm, which earned him a cult following of fans who still call him “Quiz Daddy.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“From the psychological, emotional side, I couldn’t really process what was going on,” Rogowsky says, reflecting on his viral fame. “And in the seven humbling years since, I have a vastly new perspective… I have my fanbase, I have my core followers right here. They’re on board with me, and it’s a matter of getting the word out.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?w=673\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094940\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png 1772w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=148,150 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=297,300 297w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=768,776 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=673,680 673w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=1188,1200 1188w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=1267,1280 1267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=426,430 426w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=713,720 713w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=891,900 891w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=792,800 792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=1521,1536 1521w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=661,668 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=371,375 371w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=611,617 611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=526,531 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-20-at-10.05.24-AM.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Savvy</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-we-re-not-going-anywhere-this-time\">‘We’re not going anywhere this time’</h1>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogowsky received a lot of messages over the years from people who wanted to help him build the next HQ. But last year, a direct message on X from European game designer Johan de Jager grabbed his attention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The idea was the host plays against the audience, so it’s like a two-way interaction,” Rogowsky says. “Imagine HQ if I wasn’t just asking the questions but also answering [them]… That adds another layer to it that no one had thought of before.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in the age of AI, where players can easily look up answers, Rogowsky was skeptical that a trivia game could work fairly, so Savvy embraced word puzzles instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most that Savvy has paid out in a single game is around $400 — small compared to HQ’s occasional six-figure prize pools. That’s because Rogowsky and his co-founders are funding the company themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Look, I know this isn’t the thousands of dollars that you saw on HQ, the hundreds of thousands that we eventually got to,” Rogowsky said on one recent <a href=\"https://youtu.be/J2Q0yzT76EQ?si=oyXHZRnwD9pgOnoz&amp;t=1279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TextSavvy broadcast</a>. “But the difference is HQ was funded by venture capital. They had $8 million in the bank to start. They got another $15 million from other venture capitalists. We don’t got that… This is a low-budge operashe because I’m paying for it!”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogowsky says he has spoken with investors about Savvy and even gotten some enticing offers. But venture backing often comes with pressure on founders to maximize returns as fast as they can, a model that can set a business up to fail, as HQ demonstrated. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People want to 10x and 100x [their investment]… I’d be very happy to get to a point of profitability, to where we can just keep growing the company, keep hiring more people, keep making more games,” Rogowsky says. “I’m not looking for some type of eight-figure, nine-figure exit. This is what I want to do. I’m going to do this as long as I continue to wake up every morning and say, ‘Goddamn, I’m excited to get up there in front of that camera and have fun.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TextSavvy is currently running a “Season 0,” a soft launch that allows the team to work through technical kinks before formally launching on March 1. So far, without much promotion, TextSavvy has peaked at about 4,000 viewers in one night. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not much compared to the HQ days. Then again, when TechCrunch first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/hq-trivia/\">wrote about HQ</a>, the app only had about 3,300 concurrent viewers. Who’s to say Savvy can’t do it again?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not going anywhere this time,” Rogowsky said. “There’s no one to fire me. There’s no drama, there’s no tension. There’s not going to be a documentary about Savvy the way there was about HQ.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

End-to-end encryption for RCS conversations will one day help ensure messages between iPhone users and Android users are just as secure as iMessage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Apple is only testing this between iPhones in beta. These conversations will be labeled as encrypted and cannot be read while sent between devices. The company notes that the feature will be released publicly in a later software update for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS, and the beta is not available for all devices and carriers.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-stolen-device-detection-is-on-by-default\">Stolen Device Detection is on by default</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Security improvements are another highlight of iOS 26.4. Stolen Device Protection is now enabled by default, adding an extra layer of biometric authentication for sensitive actions such as accessing saved passwords or making certain account changes. By requiring Face ID or Touch ID authentication in more scenarios, Apple reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a device is stolen and the passcode is compromised.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=486\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3095090\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=857,1200 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=914,1280 914w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=307,430 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=514,720 514w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=643,900 643w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=572,800 572w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=477,668 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=268,375 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=441,617 441w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=379,531 379w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Stolen-Phone-Protection-Stolen-Device-Protection-toggle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=36,50 36w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-carplay-adds-in-car-video-playback\">CarPlay adds in-car video playback</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Drivers using Apple CarPlay will also notice changes.

They stayed in touch even after Antony moved to Miro and Gootnick to Hopin and later Thrive Global.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No matter where they worked, Antony and Gootnick kept running into the same manual challenges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way financial statements come together, it’s just patched together in a lot of spreadsheets, moved into a bunch of Word documents, emailed back and forth between people,” Antony told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, in 2023, the pair decided to launch <a href=\"https://www.inscopehq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">InScope</a>, an AI-powered financial reporting platform that helps companies and accounting firms automate many aspects of the financial statement preparation process. The startup just raised $14.5 million in Series A funding led by Norwest, with participation from Storm Ventures and existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While InScope isn’t fully automating the generation of income statements and balance sheets yet, it automates a vast amount of the manual busy work, from verifying math to formatting. Simply ensuring that dollar signs and commas are uniform and correctly placed can save accountants up to 20% of their time, according to Antony, InScope’s CEO.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last 12 months, InScope has grown its customer base by 5x, attracting significant accounting firms such as CohnReznick, currently ranked in the <a href=\"https://insidepublicaccounting.com/ipa-top-500-firms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">top 15 nationally</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, it may be a while before accountants — a profession Antony describes as risk-averse — feel comfortable letting AI fully automate financial statement preparation. Nonetheless, that remains InScope’s ultimate goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Norwest partner Sean Jacobsohn told TechCrunch that he invested in InScope after he heard from multiple clients that the startup’s product saves them a lot of time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jacobsohn is convinced that InScope stands out because few founders possess the specific expertise required to reinvent financial reporting technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a very complex space, and you need to be able to have been in the shoes of the buyer before,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Antony agrees that accountants are not typically the type to launch startups. Fortunately, she and Gootnick developed their entrepreneurial instincts through years of operating within the fast-paced cultures of other high-growth startups.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

OpenAI has traditionally focused on consumer users, for instance, while its rival Anthropic tends to target enterprises. Elon Musk’s xAI, we discovered recently, has been placing particular emphasis on video-game walkthroughs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, Business Insider’s Grace Kay published <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a detailed and far-reaching report about xAI</a>, the AI startup recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired by SpaceX</a>, with particular emphasis on how Musk is making life difficult for employees. But this particular anecdote stood out:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game “Baldur’s Gate,” according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, you can imagine the frustration of any respected and experienced engineer who shows up to work thinking he’ll be tackling fundamental problems of knowledge and machine intelligence, only to be sidetracked into helping a 54-year-old man beat his video game. But the anecdote raises an even more pressing question: Did Musk end up getting the gaming skills he wanted?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To answer that question, our resident RPG enthusiast Ram Iyer put together a set of five general questions about Baldur’s Gate, which we ran against xAI and the three major models in a kind of quasi-benchmark that I’ve decided to call “BaldurBench.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the interest of journalistic transparency, I’ve made all the chat transcripts public, so you can see them here: <a href=\"https://grok.com/c/ab4b736e-fee2-441e-857f-23707c1ff45a?rid=d42e7633-df9f-41d6-bd77-6d29ca2feba6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Grok</a>, <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/699886c6-e330-8013-9490-1263ab24d24b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/23f5f1e3-0f00-40bf-a651-8a3c180b68c6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude</a>, and <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/share/862fa83ab1da\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gemini</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, the good news: Grok actually gives pretty good information. Its responses were a bit dense with gamer jargon — “save-scumming” instead of saving and “DPS” instead of damage — but the answers were both useful and well-informed, provided you knew what it was talking about. Grok also really loves tables and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorycraft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">theorycraft</a>, which is about what you would expect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are lots of Baldur’s Gate guides out there and the models were generally drawing from the same ones, so the biggest differences were stylistic. ChatGPT prefers bulleted lists and sentence fragments, while Gemini loves to bold important words.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest surprise was Claude, which was particularly concerned about giving me information that would spoil my experience of the game. When I asked about good party compositions, it closed the guidance by saying, “Don’t stress too much and just play what sounds fun to you.” Thanks, Claude!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to bear in mind, this is a subject area we know (thanks to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Business Insider’s reporting</a>) that xAI has specifically focused on reaching parity. So we shouldn’t read too much into the fact that, after the reported sprint, Grok’s advice turned out about the same as the other models. Still, it’s nice to know xAI can make it work if it tries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p> \n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Under this scheme, the workers’ earnings were funneled back to Pyongyang, which the regime used to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/five-people-plead-guilty-to-helping-north-koreans-infiltrate-us-companies-as-remote-it-workers/\">latest in a string of recent convictions</a> of individuals involved in facilitating ongoing North Korean <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/\">so-called “IT worker” schemes</a>. Security researchers have described North Korean workers as a “triple threat” to U.S. and Western businesses, as they violate U.S. sanctions, all the while enabling North Koreans to steal sensitive company data, and then later extort those victim companies into not publicly releasing corporate secrets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors said Didenko ran a website called Upworksell, which allowed people working overseas, including North Koreans, to buy or rent stolen identities for gaining employment with U.S. firms. Didenko handled more than 870 stolen identities, per the Justice Department.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FBI seized Upworksell in 2024 and diverted its traffic to its own servers. Polish authorities arrested Didenko, who was then extradited to the U.S. and later pleaded guilty.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Upsellwork's website, at the time of its seizure by the FBI in 2024.\" class=\"wp-image-3094992\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg 1113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=430,278 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=720,466 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=900,582 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=800,518 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=668,432 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=580,375 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=954,617 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=708,458 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upsell.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A screenshot showing Upworksell’s website at the time it was seized by the FBI (ImagE: TechCrunch/screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/ukrainian-national-sentenced-laptop-farm-scheme-generated-income-north-korean-it-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a statement this week</a>, the U.S. Department of Justice said Didenko also paid people to receive and host computers at their homes in California, Tennessee, and Virginia.

To sign up, users had to authenticate with their Instagram credentials, which allowed Threads to populate with account details, like username, bio, and photo, as well as verification status and followers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With one tap, users could immediately follow the accounts they already followed on Instagram — and those not on Threads would get a notification that someone had added them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the months and years following its launch, Meta has heavily leaned on its other, bigger social platforms to continue to grow Threads, including by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/19/threads-latest-growth-hack-is-showing-posts-on-facebook/\">displaying popular Threads posts on Facebook</a> and adding a similar carousel of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/meta-is-now-showing-a-carousel-of-suggested-threads-on-instagram-to-bump-up-engagement/\">Threads posts to Instagram users</a>. The company also made it easy for users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/22/how-to-cross-post-from-instagram-and-facebook-to-threads/\">cross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads</a>, which also helped boost adoption. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These moves have paid off. Data from market intelligence provider Similarweb last month indicated that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/\">Threads is now seeing more daily usage</a> than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. (X still dominates on the web, however.) Threads’ numbers overall have been steadily growing as well, doubling usage from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/02/metas-threads-cross-200-million-active-users/\">200 million monthly active users in August 2024</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/threads-now-has-more-than-400-million-monthly-active-users/\">400 million monthly users</a> as of August 2025. The company announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/threads-now-lets-you-approve-and-filter-your-replies/\">in October</a> that Threads reached 150 million daily active users, as well. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
