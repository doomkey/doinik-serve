Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the previously announced <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2022/06/21/wikimedia-enterprise-announces-google-and-internet-archive-first-customers/\">partnership with Google in 2022</a>, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before, but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers’ queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn’t just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The foundation also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/blog/wikipedia-25-enterprise-partners/\">noted</a> in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top-ten most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation’s CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site’s past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 PM UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia’s YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The organization’s birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/04/30/our-new-ai-strategy-puts-wikipedias-humans-first/\">approach to AI,</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-experiments/\">new experiments</a> like games and short-form video, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Absent any changes, the world could face a severe shortfall <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://press.spglobal.com/2026-01-08-Substantial-Shortfall-in-Copper-Supply-Widens-as-the-Race-for-AI-and-Growing-Defense-Spending-Add-to-Accelerating-Demand,-New-S-P-Global-Study-Finds\">as early as 2040</a>, with demand exceeding supply by as much as 25%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If copper seems expensive today, just wait a few years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies and investors have been pouring money into the sector as demand ramps up. AI minerals startup KoBold, for example, raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/02/kobold-used-ai-to-find-copper-now-investors-are-piling-in-to-the-tune-of-537m/\">$537 million last year</a> to exploit a copper deposit it found in Zambia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with a little help from some microbes, today’s copper producers might be able to beat the shortage. One startup, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://transitionmetal.com/\">Transition Metal Solutions</a>, says it has found a way to boost copper production by 20% to 30% using additives to boost the microbes’ performance. Think of it as probiotics for copper mines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To scale up its technology, Transition Metal Solutions has raised a $6 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Transition Ventures with participation from Astor Management AG, Climate Capital, Dolby Family Ventures, Essential Capital, Juniper VC, Kayak Ventures, New Climate Ventures, Possible Ventures, SOSV, and Understorey Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microbes have always been key players in the copper world, helping the metal break out of its mineral form so that we can refine it into pure metal. Companies have been working for years to coax microbes into squeezing more copper out of ore, but according to Sasha Milshteyn, co-founder and CEO of Transition, they’ve been going about it the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Typically, companies isolate or engineer strains that show promise in boosting copper production. They grow large quantities of them and pour them over an ore heap, where the microbes soak in and get to work.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That by and large hasn’t paid off,” Milshteyn told TechCrunch. “Often they will see kind of a boost early on and then it just kind of falls off — or they don’t see any boost at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Milshteyn suspects that part of the problem is that microbes aren’t solo actors. It’s like casting a star without a supporting cast. Microbes live in diverse communities where each plays a role. Bumping up the population of one strain can only do so much.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another part of the problem is that we’ve only scratched the surface on understanding microbes in ore heaps. “When you look into the microbial community that’s present in the material, typically well over 90% of it are things that we’ve never seen before,” Milshteyn said</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conditions inside a heap leach, as the acid-laced piles of ore are called, are challenging to replicate in a lab. The pH is low, around two, and there are clays and other metals floating around, all of which undermine the usual molecular tools scientists use to understand microbial communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everything that the industry has done has really focused on that tiny fraction that people have been able to grow in the lab,” he said. “Typically, it’s in the 5% range that you can culture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So instead of trying to isolate a few star performers, Transition is working to raise the entire community up. The company applies low cost, mostly inorganic compounds that are already found at mining sites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’re focused on is not necessarily boosting one or two species, but we’re we are trying to nudge the community towards the higher functional state,” he said. “We’ve observed that in the lab.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In lab samples that Transition has applied its proprietary cocktail to, the startup has been able to extract 90% of the copper from the ore, up from 60% using traditional methods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of the lab, Milshteyn expects the efficacy to drop a bit, though not by much. Traditional heap leaches extract around 30% to 60% of the copper in the ore. He thinks Transition can bring that up to at least 50% to 70%, maybe as higher. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each mine has a different microbial community, so Transition plans to tailor its additives based on initial testing. As the company gathers more data, Milshteyn thinks that eventually he and his team will be able to predict what a mine needs in advance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that rate, the company’s probiotics could solve the copper shortage before it starts. But first, Transition has to show the mining industry that its solution works. The company plans to work with a third-party metallurgy lab that’s known within the mining world. “Without third party results, nobody’s going to believe you,” Milshteyn said. Money from the seed round should cover that phase of testing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Transition has proven it works in the lab, then it’ll apply its treatment to a demonstration heap containing tens of thousands of tons of material. With luck, it’ll then deploy its technology at copper mines around the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re leaving 65% of material behind” at typical mines, Milshteyn said. “We may as well get as much out of it as we can.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In practice, however, as seen in the examples above, users are finding ways around these guardrails. Or these guardrails are failing,” the letter reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grok, and consequently X, have been heavily criticized for enabling this trend, but other platforms are not immune.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deepfakes first gained popularity on Reddit, when a page displaying <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06216\">synthetic porn videos of celebrities</a> went viral before the platform took it down in 2018. Sexualized deepfakes targeting celebrities and politicians have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392682276_Who_Are_the_Targets_of_Deepfakes_Evidence_From_Flagged_Videos_on_TikTok_and_YouTube\">multiplied on TikTok and YouTube</a>, though they usually originate elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s Oversight Board last year called out <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oversightboard.com/news/new-decision-addresses-metas-rules-on-non-consensual-deepfake-intimate-images/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">two cases of explicit AI images</a> of female public figures, and the platform has also allowed nudify apps to sell ads on its services, though it did <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/meta-files-lawsuit-against-developer-of-crushai-nudify-app.html\">sue a company called CrushAI later</a>.

Alphabet, Reddit, Snap, TikTok and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter demands the companies provide: </p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Policy definitions of “deepfake” content, “non-consensual intimate imagery,” or similar terms.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Descriptions of the companies’ policies and enforcement approach for non-consensual AI deepfakes of peoples’ bodies, non-nude pictures, altered clothing and “virtual undressing.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Descriptions of current content policies addressing edited media and explicit content, as well as internal guidance provided to moderators.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">How current policies govern AI tools and image generators as they relate to suggestive or intimate content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">What filters, guardrails or measures have been implemented to prevent the generation and distribution of deepfakes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Which mechanisms the companies use to identify deepfake content and prevent them from being re-uploaded.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">How they prevent users from profiting from such content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">How the platforms prevent themselves from monetizing non-consensual AI-generated content.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">How the companies’ terms of service enable them to ban or suspend users who post deepfakes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">What the companies do to notify victims of non-consensual sexual deepfakes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter is signed by Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes just a day after xAI’s owner Elon Musk said that he was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\">“not aware</a> of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Later on Wednesday, California’s attorney general <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opened an investigation</a> into xAI’s chatbot, following mounting pressure from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">governments across the world</a> incensed by the lack of guardrails around Grok that allowed this to happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223\">maintained</a> that it takes action to remove “illegal content on X, including [CSAM] and non-consensual nudity,” though neither the company nor Musk have addressed the fact that Grok was allowed to generate such edits in the first place. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem isn’t constrained to non-consensual manipulated sexualized imagery either. While not all AI-based image generation and editing services let users “undress” people, they do let one easily generate deepfakes. To pick a few examples, OpenAI’s Sora 2 reportedly <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-using-sora-2-to-make-child-fetish-content/\">allowed users to generate explicit videos</a> featuring children; Google’s Nano Banana seemingly <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/charlie-kirks-nano-banana-figurine-sparks-backlash-x-account-suspended-as-public-calls-for-fbi-intervention/articleshow/124044298.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">generated</a> an image showing Charlie Kirk being shot; and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/697188/racist-ai-generated-videos-google-veo-3-tiktok\">racist videos</a> made with Google’s AI video model are garnering millions of views on social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue grows even more complex when Chinese image and video generators come into the picture. Many Chinese tech companies and apps — especially those linked to ByteDance — offer easy ways to edit faces, voices and videos, and those outputs have spread to Western social platforms. China has stronger synthetic content labeling requirements that don’t exist in the U.S. on the federal level, where the masses instead rely on fragmented and dubiously enforced policies from the platforms themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. lawmakers have already passed some legislation seeking to rein in deepfake pornography, but the impact has been limited. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\">The Take It Down Act</a>, which became federal law in May, is meant to criminalize the creation and dissemination of non-consensual, sexualized imagery. But <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/a-new-jersey-lawsuit-shows-how-hard-it-is-to-fight-deepfake-porn/\">a number of provisions in the law</a> make it difficult to hold image-generating platforms accountable, as they focus most of the scrutiny on individual users instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, a number states are trying to take matters into their own hands to protect consumers and elections. This week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-proposals-protect-consumers-and-workers\">New York Governor Kathy Hochul proposed laws</a> that would require AI-generated content to be labeled as such, and ban non-consensual deepfakes in specified periods leading up to elections, including depictions of opposition candidates.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round comes just eight months after the company raised $120 million at a $1 billion valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from returning backers including EQT Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Durable Capital, and Mosaic Ventures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parloa is one of many startups developing AI agents that promise to automate the kind of customer service work previously handled by human representatives and help desk staff.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s competitors include Sierra, co-founded by OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, which raised $350 million at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/04/bret-taylors-sierra-raises-350m-at-a-10b-valuation/\">$10 billion valuation</a> in September; and Decagon, reportedly in talks to raise capital at a valuation of upwards of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/customer-support-ai-startup-decagon-talks-raise-4-billion-valuation?rc=em6blq\">$4 billion</a>. Other companies working to replace human agents with AI include older players Intercom and Kore.ai, as well as the U.K.-based PolyAI, which raised an $86 million round at a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/12/15/polyai-raises-86-million-as-fight-to-answer-calls-with-ai-heats-up/\">$750 million valuation</a> last month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Malte Kosub, Parloa’s co-founder and CEO, doesn’t seem fazed by the competition, largely because he doesn’t believe this is a “winner-take-all” category. “In the end, it is one of the biggest opportunities that has ever existed in software,” he told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, Parloa and its rivals are vying to automate a significant portion of the global customer support workforce, which Gartner estimates at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-08-31-gartner-predicts-conversational-ai-will-reduce-contac\">17 million</a> contact center agents worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s not just the size of the market that gives Kosub confidence about Parloa’s ability to win. He pointed to the startup’s massive fundraise as a sign that it could be among the top leaders in the space. “There are a lot of companies out there, but you need to look at the scale and the amount of funding they got,” he said. “The number of competitors is decreasing significantly.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, Parloa said that it was generating annual recurring revenue of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/six-months-an-ai-unicorn-parloa-surpasses-50m-revenue-mark-302645927.html\">more than $50 million</a>, but that’s not meaningfully ahead of Poly AI, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/12/15/polyai-raises-86-million-as-fight-to-answer-calls-with-ai-heats-up/\">expected to end 2025 with ARR of $40 million</a>, or Decagon, which is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/customer-support-ai-startup-decagon-talks-raise-4-billion-valuation?rc=em6blq\">reportedly</a> making “significantly more” than $30 million in ARR.

The decision set aside a 2024 Delhi High Court ruling that had overturned a 2020 order by the Authority for Advance Rulings, which had found the firm was, prima facie, avoiding tax and therefore not eligible for treaty relief.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ruling is being closely watched by investors, as it strengthens India’s hand in challenging offshore “treaty-routing” structures that have long been used to reduce tax on high-value exits. It could also raise uncertainty over how future cross-border deals are structured and priced, at a time when foreign funds are counting on India as a key growth market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its verdict, a two-judge bench <a href=\"https://www.sci.gov.in/view-pdf/?diary_no=12512025&amp;type=j&amp;order_date=2026-01-15&amp;from=latest_judgements_order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> (PDF) that when a transaction appears, at first glance, to be designed to avoid income tax, India’s advance-ruling mechanism cannot be used to seek protection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tiger Global first invested in India’s e-commerce firm Flipkart in 2009 with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/tiger-global-management-is-killing-it-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an initial $9 million investment</a>, before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/30/walmart-flipkart-tiger-global/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increasing its exposure to about $1.2 billion</a> over multiple funding rounds, TechCrunch had reported earlier. The firm later sold its stake to Walmart <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/secondary-venture-sales-tiger-flipkart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for about $1.4 billion in 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tax dispute centers on how Tiger Global structured that investment — through entities in Mauritius — and whether those vehicles could claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty to shield capital gains from Indian tax.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While selling Flipkart’s stake during Walmart’s $16 billion deal, Tiger Global sought a certificate allowing no tax to be withheld, arguing that because the shares were acquired before April 1, 2017, the gains were exempt from Indian capital gains tax under a “grandfathering” clause, protecting older investments from the newer tax regime, in the India–Mauritius double taxation avoidance agreement. Indian tax authorities rejected the request in 2020, questioning the offshore structure chosen by the investment firm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Supreme Court bench framed the dispute as an issue of sovereign taxing powers, warning against structures that are designed primarily to dilute that authority.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Taxing an income arising out of its own country is an inherent sovereign right of that country,” the bench said, adding that “any dilution of this power through artificial arrangements is a direct threat to its sovereignty and long-term national interest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The judgment should be read as a caution against aggressive tax planning rather than a wholesale dismantling of the India–Mauritius treaty framework, Ajay Rotti, a tax expert and founder and CEO of tax advisory firm Tax Compass, <a href=\"https://x.com/ajayrotti/status/2011757329788923988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> on X. He said the decision reinforces a broader shift toward “substance over form”, signalling treaty protection may not apply automatically where offshore entities lack real commercial activity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tiger Global did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm can seek a review of the verdict, though such petitions are rarely successful.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup is developing a launch vehicle designed to be fully reusable and is readying engine hot-fire tests ahead of its first technology demonstration flight, planned for 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based company confirms that it closed an oversubscribed $20.5 million Series A round led by TDK Ventures and BIG Capital, as TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/tdk-ventures-accel-set-to-back-indias-etherealx-in-reusable-launch-vehicle-push-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported</a> earlier.

EtherealX is aiming for that space with its fully reusable vehicle designed to return both the booster and upper stag. That’s an approach that, if proven, could cut per-launch costs and increase flight frequency without relying on a native constellation to keep rockets fully booked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EtherealX is developing two engines in-house: the 80-kilonewton “Pegasus” upper-stage engine and the 1.2-meganewton “Stallion” booster engine, with hot-fire tests targeted for June–July.

It will initially focus on the western Indian state of Maharashtra and involve around 40,000–45,000 smallholder farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agreement comes as large corporations, including Microsoft, ramp up spending on carbon removal — projects designed to physically remove carbon dioxide from the air. The Redmond-based software maker is working toward its goal of becoming <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">carbon-negative by 2030</a>. However, Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/29/environmental-sustainability-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">total greenhouse gas emissions rose 23.4%</a> in fiscal year 2024 from a 2020 baseline, primarily driven by value-chain emissions linked to its growing cloud and AI business. Microsoft has not yet reported on its carbon progress for 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the rapid expansion of AI operations, energy use and emissions are rising, pushing companies to look beyond the U.S. for carbon removal projects that can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. India has increasingly emerged as an attractive market for such projects because of its large volumes of agricultural waste and the scale of its farming economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha will develop 18 industrial reactors that will operate for 15 years, with a total projected removal volume exceeding 2 million tons of carbon dioxide over the project’s lifetime, the companies said in a statement on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the biggest gaps in carbon removal markets is not just installing equipment to produce biochar, but running projects reliably and navigating a stringent process to issue credits. Varaha’s ability to deliver credits at scale helped it emerge as the world’s second-largest player in durable carbon deliveries and drew Microsoft’s attention, co-founder and CEO Madhur Jain said in an interview.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082744\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A Farmer spreading Biochar in their farm to enhance soil quality</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Varaha</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s requirements for digital monitoring, reporting, and verification meant Varaha had to build bespoke systems in-house, Jain told TechCrunch, adding that working with tens of thousands of smallholder farmers in India makes tracking and logistics far more complex than biochar projects in the U.S. or Europe that rely on biomass concentrated at a single industrial site.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More than 30% of our team has worked in agriculture,” Jain said, adding that the experience has helped Varaha design systems that work on the ground with farmers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The project’s first reactor will be located next to Varaha’s 52-acre cotton research farm in Maharashtra, where the startup works with farmers to test practices such as applying biochar to soil under real-world conditions. The startup plans to scale up to 18 reactors across India’s cotton-growing belt under Microsoft’s commitment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha has rapidly scaled its biochar operations over the past year, Jain said. In 2025, it processed about 240,000 tons of biomass, producing roughly 55,000–56,000 tons of biochar and generating around 115,000 credits, up from around 15,000–18,000 a year earlier, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup expects volumes to rise further as new contracts kick in, with Jain saying it aims to at least double its 2025 throughput in 2026 to around half a million tons of biomass and close to 250,000 tons of carbon sequestered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Varaha has 20 projects in total across India, Nepal, and Bangladesh — 14 in advanced stages and another six in early stages — spanning regenerative agriculture, biochar, agroforestry, and enhanced rock weathering and works with around 150,000 farmers. These projects have the potential to sequester about 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide over lifetimes ranging from 15 to 40 years, Jain said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082746\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A Gassifer to convert biomass into biochar</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Varaha</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond carbon credits, the latest project aims to reduce open burning of cotton stalks, which contributes to seasonal air pollution in parts of India, while returning biochar to farms to improve soil health and reduce dependence on chemical fertilizers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This offtake agreement broadens the diversity of Microsoft’s carbon removal portfolio with Varaha’s biochar project design that is both scalable and durable,” said Phil Goodman, Microsoft’s CDR program director, in a prepared statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Varaha deal highlights Microsoft’s push to diversify its carbon removal portfolio, the volumes remain small compared with its overall footprint, as the software giant <a href=\"https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/msc/documents/presentations/CSR/2025-Microsoft-Environmental-Data-Fact-Sheet-PDF.pdf#page=01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> (PDF) total greenhouse gas emissions of 15.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in FY2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft contracted for <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about 22 million metric tons of carbon removals</a> in FY2024 as part of its carbon-negative strategy.

Wired reports that the split between Zoph and Thinking Labs <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/thinking-machines-lab-cofounders-leave-for-openai/\">wasn’t amicable</a>.

The finalized order, which comes a year after the agency reached a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/gm-banned-from-sharing-driving-and-location-data-with-insurance-companies/\">proposed settlement</a> with GM, also requires the automaker to be more transparent with its consumers and obtain their explicit consent on any data collection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/GMAdminOrderDec2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">finalized order</a> comes nearly two years after a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">New York Times report </a>showed how GM and OnStar collected, used, and sold drivers’ precise geolocation data and driving behavior to third parties, including data brokers LexisNexis and Verisk. The data was collected through GM’s Smart Driver program, a free feature contained within its connected car apps that tracked and rated driving behaviors and seatbelt use. Data brokers sold this information to insurance providers, which could affect customers’ rates, the NYT reported at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM <a href=\"https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2024/apr/0424-driver.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discontinued</a> the Smart Driver program in April 2024 across all of its brands, citing customer feedback. GM said at the time it unenrolled all customers and ended its third-party telematics relationships with LexisNexis and Verisk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FTC alleged that GM and OnStar used a misleading enrollment process to get consumers to sign up for its OnStar connected vehicle service and OnStar Smart Driver feature. The FTC also alleged the automaker failed to clearly disclose that the data would be collected and sold to third parties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the order finalized Wednesday, GM is also required to obtain explicit consent from consumers prior to collecting, using, or sharing connected vehicle data. This process occurs at the dealership when a consumer buys a car from a GM brand. At that point, the OnStar system is linked to that particular vehicle VIN number and the new owner is asked whether they agree or not with data collection, according to GM.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some exceptions to the data collection ban, however. GM is allowed to share location data with emergency first responders and for internal research, the FTC said. GM confirmed this, noting it collects data for internal research and development and sometimes shares de-identified, or anonymized data (not associated with specific drivers or vehicles) with select partners to enhance city infrastructure and improve road safety. For instance, data has been shared with the University of Michigan, which used it for <a href=\"https://www.umtri.umich.edu/2025/11/05/new-traffic-signal-reduces-unnecessary-stops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">urban planning. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM must also establish a way for all U.S. consumers to request a copy of their data and seek its deletion and give them the ability to disable the collection of precise geolocation data from their vehicles. GM says it has already complied with these mandates.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM says it began overhauling its policies and programs on data collection and privacy in 2024. For instance, the automaker said it has consolidated many of its U.S. privacy statements into a single, simpler statement and expanded its privacy program that allows customers to access and delete their personal information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Federal Trade Commission has formally approved the agreement reached last year with General Motors to address concerns,” an emailed statement from GM reads. “As vehicle connectivity becomes increasingly integral to the driving experience, GM remains committed to protecting customer privacy, maintaining trust, and ensuring customers have a clear understanding of our practices.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The funding values Emversity at around $120 million post-money, sources confirmed to TechCrunch, up from about $60 million in its April 2025 pre-Series A round. Total funding now stands at $46 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has been grappling with a widening skills gap, with graduates often entering the workforce without job-ready skills even as key service sectors struggle to hire trained staff. In healthcare, the Indian government says the country has <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2197614\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about 4.3 million registered nursing personnel</a> and 5,253 nursing institutions producing roughly 387,000 nurses annually, yet recent reports have <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/indias-home-nurses-are-overworked-untrained-and-undervalued-how-to-bridge-the-gap-in-elderly-care/articleshow/120876242.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">continued to flag a shortage</a>. Hospitality, too, has faced a <a href=\"https://etedge-insights.com/industry/travel-and-leisure/hospitalitys-great-talent-gap-why-the-luxury-industry-must-rethink-attraction-retention/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">55% to 60% demand-supply gap</a> for workers, according to industry estimates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity is trying to bridge that gap by integrating employer-designed training programs into university curricula and running skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and placements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two-year-old startup has partnered with 23 universities and colleges across over 40 campuses and focuses on “grey-collar” roles — positions that require hands-on training and credentialing — including nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, as well as hospitality roles such as guest relations and food and beverage service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity has trained about 4,500 learners so far and placed 800 candidates to date, founder and CEO Vivek Sinha (pictured above) said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sinha, who previously served as chief operating officer at Indian edtech startup Unacademy for over three years before starting Emversity in 2023, told TechCrunch he conceived the idea while working on test-preparation courses for entry-level government jobs. He noticed that applicants included engineers, MBAs, and even PhDs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I started speaking to these learners,” he said. “Some of them had paid fees to private colleges and spent 16 to 18 years earning those degrees.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sinha said the gap has widened in recent years and could grow further as automation and new workplace tools change what employers expect from entry-level hires, while demand remains strong in credentialed roles such as healthcare, where hands-on training and staffing ratios still matter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI can cut down the administrative work of a nurse, such as filing patient details or electronic medical records,” Sinha stated. “But AI can’t replace a nurse if you still need one at an ICU for every two beds.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity works with employers such as Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels), and Lemon Tree Hotels to co-design role-specific training modules, which it then helps universities embed into their degree programs. The startup does not charge employers, instead earning revenue through fees paid by partner institutions and through short-term certification programs run at its NSDC-affiliated skill centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup operates with gross margins of about 80% and has kept customer acquisition costs below 10% of revenue by relying largely on organic channels rather than performance marketing, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the startup offers a career counseling platform for high school students that generated more than 350,000 inquiries and accounted for more than 20% of revenue last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the fresh funding, Emversity plans to expand its footprint to more than 200 locations over the next two years and deepen its focus on healthcare and hospitality, while entering new industries such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and manufacturing. The startup is already in advanced discussions with one of India’s top EPC companies to design and roll out role-specific programs this year, and plans to begin manufacturing-focused training next year, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To deliver consistent outcomes across campuses, Emversity combines employer-led curriculum design with hands-on training infrastructure, including simulation labs for clinical roles such as nursing and emergency care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Emversity’s revenue split roughly evenly between its university-embedded training programs and short-term certification courses run through its own skill centers, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Emversity currently builds talent pipelines for domestic employers, Sinha said the startup sees an opportunity to eventually serve international demand as well, particularly in healthcare, as aging populations in markets such as Japan and Germany look for trained workers. However, he did not disclose the exact timeline for catering to global demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity has about 700 employees, including 200 to 250 trainers deployed across its campus network.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Copyleaks, an AI detection and content governance platform, estimated roughly one image was posted each minute on X. A separate <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2Nzc5MDk4NywiZXhwIjoxNzY4Mzk1Nzg3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOEhRS0hLR0lGUE8wMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.3B4JWnmqmXFC3DOqhs11h99g5gNzi4j_poKAHLuWdrY&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sample</a> gathered from January 5 to January 6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. (X and xAI are part of the same company.) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This material…has been used to harass people across the internet,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement. “I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AG’s office will investigate whether and how xAI violated the law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several laws exist to protect targets of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\">Take It Down Act</a> was signed into a federal law, which criminalizes knowingly distributing nonconsensual intimate images — including deepfakes — and requires platforms like X to remove such content within 48 hours. California also has its own <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/19/governor-newsom-signs-bills-to-crack-down-on-sexually-explicit-deepfakes-require-ai-watermarking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">series of laws</a> that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2024 to crack down on sexually explicit deepfakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grok began fulfilling user requests on X to produce sexualized photos of women and children toward the end of the year. The trend appears to have taken off after certain adult-content creators prompted Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves as a form of marketing, which then led to other users issuing similar prompts. In a number of public cases, including well-known figures like “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown, Grok responded to prompts asking it to alter real photos of real women by changing clothing, body positioning, or physical features in overtly sexual ways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/13/musks-x-stops-bikini-bot-undressing-women/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some reports</a>, xAI has begun implementing safeguards to address the issue. Grok now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/x-restricts-groks-image-generation-to-paying-subscribers-only-after-drawing-the-worlds-ire/\">requires a premium subscription</a> before responding to certain image-generation requests, and even then the image may not be generated. April Kozen, VP of marketing at Copyleaks, told TechCrunch that Grok may fulfill a request in a more generic or toned-down way. They added that Grok appears more permissive with adult content creators. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, these behaviors suggest X is experimenting with multiple mechanisms to reduce or control problematic image generation, though inconsistencies remain,” Kozen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neither xAI nor Musk has publicly addressed the problem head on. A few days after the instances began, Musk appeared to make light of the issue by asking Grok to generate an <a href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/2006546133875876195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2006547579161686289%7Ctwgr%5Ecd342afac0c746785e362fda4ec482da7d71b4d4%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mandatory.com%2Fnews%2F1708977-elon-musk-bikini-grok-ai-image\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">image of himself in a bikini</a>. On January 3, <a href=\"https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">X’s safety account</a> said the company takes “action against illegal content on X, including [CSAM],” without specifically addressing Grok’s apparent lack of safeguards or the creation of sexualized manipulated imagery involving women. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The positioning mirrors what Musk posted today, emphasizing illegality and user behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk wrote he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” That statement doesn’t deny the existence of bikini pics or sexualized edits more broadly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School and former litigator, told TechCrunch that Musk likely narrowly focused on CSAM because the penalties for creating or distributing synthetic sexualized imagery of children are greater. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For example, in the United States, the distributor or threatened distributor of CSAM can face up to three years imprisonment under the Take It Down Act, compared to two for nonconsensual adult sexual imagery,” Goodyear said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the “bigger point” is Musk’s attempt to draw attention to problematic user content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user request,” Musk wrote in his post. “When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taken together, the post characterizes these incidents as uncommon, attributes them to user requests or adversarial prompting, and presents them as technical issues that can be solved through fixes. It stops short of acknowledging any shortcomings in Grok’s underlying safety design. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Regulators may consider, with attention to free speech protections, requiring proactive measures by AI developers to prevent such content,” Goodyear said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI to ask how many times it caught instances of nonconsensual sexually manipulated images of women and children, what guardrails specifically changed, and whether the company notified regulators of the issue. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The California AG isn’t the only regulator to try to hold xAI accountable for the issue. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">Indonesia and Malaysia</a> have both temporarily blocked access to Grok; India has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/india-orders-musks-x-to-fix-grok-over-obscene-ai-content/\">demanded that X</a> make immediate technical and procedural changes to Grok; the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-commission-has-ordered-x-retain-all-grok-documents-until-end-2026-2026-01-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">European Commission ordered</a> xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot, a precursor to opening a new investigation; and the U.K.’s online safety watchdog <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/ofcom-launches-investigation-into-x-over-grok-sexualised-imagery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ofcom opened a formal investigation</a> under the U.K.’s Online Safety Act. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI has come under fire for Grok’s sexualized imagery before. As AG Bonta pointed out in a statement, Grok includes a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/grok-imagine-xais-new-ai-image-and-video-generator-lets-you-make-nsfw-content/\">“spicy mode”</a> to generate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/of-course-groks-ai-companions-want-to-have-sex-and-burn-down-schools/\">explicit content</a>. In October, an update made it even easier to jailbreak what little safety guidelines there were, resulting in many users creating hardcore pornography with Grok, as well as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">graphic and violent sexual images</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the more pornographic images that Grok has produced have been of AI-generated people — something that many might still find ethically dubious but perhaps less harmful to the individuals in the images and videos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people’s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,” Copyleaks co-founder and CEO Alon Yamin said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “From Sora to Grok, we are seeing a rapid rise in AI capabilities for manipulated media. To that end, detection and governance are needed now more than ever to help prevent misuse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The chipmaker will deliver 750 megawatts of compute to the AI giant starting this year and continuing through the year 2028, <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/openai-partners-with-cerebras-to-bring-high-speed-inference-to-the-mainstream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cerebras said</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is worth over $10 billion, a source familiar with the details told TechCrunch. Reuters also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-buy-compute-capacity-startup-cerebras-around-10-billion-wsj-reports-2026-01-14/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> the deal size.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both companies said that the deal is about delivering faster outputs for OpenAI’s customers. In <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/cerebras-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a>, OpenAI said these systems would speed responses that currently require more time to process. Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, said just as “broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras has been around for <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over a decade</a> but its star has risen significantly since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and the AI boom that followed. The company claims its systems, built with its chips designed for AI use, are faster than GPU-based systems (such as Nvidia’s offerings).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras filed for an IPO in 2024 but since then has pushed it back a number of times. In the meantime, the company has continued to <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/press-release/series-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raise large amounts of money</a>. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chipmaker-cerebras-talks-raise-1-billion-22-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it was reported</a> that the company was in talks to raise another billion dollars at a $22 billion valuation. It’s also worth noting that OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, is already <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an investor in the company</a> and that OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/openai-at-one-point-considered-acquiring-ai-chip-startup-cerebras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">once considered acquiring it</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads,” said Sachin Katti of OpenAI in the company’s post. “Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Davidson already has two comedy specials on the service that have performed well for the streamer. Meanwhile, Irvin was a big focus in Netflix’s documentary series “America’s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Davidson’s show will feature candid, behind-the-scenes conversations with friends from his own garage, airing every Friday, while Irvin’s show will deliver in-depth sports news, analysis, and commentary twice a week, joined by notable guest co-hosts like former NFL All-Pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These originals will join Netflix’s growing slate of video podcasts, alongside licensed titles from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/netflix-doubles-down-on-video-podcasts-with-iheartmedia-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iHeartMedia</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a>, and Barstool Sports such as Dear Chelsea, My Favorite Murder, and The Ringer. Notably, as part of these licensing agreements, these shows aren’t available in full on YouTube. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wednesday’s news comes at a time when Netflix is increasingly trying to challenge YouTube’s dominance in the podcast space, with viewers watching <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcasts-living-room-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 700 million hours</a> of podcasts per month on living room devices in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Netflix is still in the early stages of developing its podcast library. With millions of podcasts available across YouTube, Spotify, and other rival platforms, the vast array of choices poses a significant challenge for Netflix. If the company wants to grab a decent chunk of that audience, it’s got a lot of catching up to do.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix’s chief technology officer, Elizabeth Stone, addressed the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/netflix-cto-says-more-vertical-video-experiments-are-coming-but-streamer-is-not-competing-with-tiktok/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">podcast ambitions</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in October, discussing how the expansion into video podcasts represents part of a broader strategy to explore new interactive content types.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

app economy. In 2025, consumers spent $72.2 billion on mobile games, accounting for about 46% of all spending within mobile apps. While that figure is up 10% year-over-year, spending on non-game mobile apps also increased. In fact, non-game app spending is up 33.9% year-over-year and reached $82.6 billion in 2025, Appfigures said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While consumers may not like that nearly every app now has in-app purchases or a subscription model built in, this has offered a more sustainable path for app developers. Plus, the shift toward ongoing payments for apps has helped fuel an ecosystem of businesses serving the mobile app ecosystem. This includes subscription management platform RevenueCat, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/revenuecat-raises-50m-as-it-expands-beyond-mobile-app-monetization/\">which raised a $50 million Series C</a> this past year, and <a href=\"https://www.appcharge.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Appcharge</a>, a startup helping mobile games <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/appcharge-raises-26m-to-help-gaming-apps-cut-out-apple-and-google-from-virtual-goods-revenues/\">improve</a> their monetization, which announced a <a href=\"https://www.appcharge.com/blog/announcing-our-58-m-series-b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$58 million Series B</a> back in August.

This year’s figure of 106.9 billion installs was down from 109.8 billion in 2024, and follows slowed download growth between 2023 and 2024, when installs were down 3.3%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mobile game downloads saw a larger decline this year. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, down 8.6% year-over-year, after a 6.6% decline from 2023 to 2024. Non-game app downloads were essentially flat — they only saw a slight increase of 1.1% year-over-year, reaching 67.4 billion. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div

After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/69630fa9-02d4-8012-8ef2-84c443c04922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chain of thought</a> is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Legendre’s formula</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bertrand’s postulate</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David_theorem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Star of David theorum</a>. Eventually, the model found <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/138209/product-of-central-binomial-coefficients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Math Overflow post from 2013</a>, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Somani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over 1,000 conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are <a href=\"https://www.erdosproblems.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">maintained online</a>. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve</a> — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contributions-to-Erd%C5%91s-problems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on his GitHub page</a>, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115891257393270694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">On Mastodon</a>, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another driving force is a recent shift toward formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, the IPO research firm <a href=\"https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/116132/Advertising-mobile-app-software-Liftoff-Mobile-files-for-an-estimated-$400-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Renaissance Capital</a> reports the whisper number at $400 million, meaning that’s what the street thinks the company hopes to raise.<br><br>The company offers a platform that helps mobile app developers market their apps and was formed in 2021 through a merger of Liftoff and Vungle. Blackstone acquired the majority of its shares at the time and the finance giant also appointed new leadership, meaning it is no longer a founder-run company. After the offering, Blackstone will remain the majority shareholder, according to the S-1 filing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another interesting tidbit: This listing, despite its relatively small expected size, has an unusually large number of bankers underwriting it. The offering has three joint lead bankers (Goldman, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley) and another 12 banks assisting to sell, plus three other financial institutions, including Blackstone, involved. Whew! That could either be a sign of strong investor interest or the need to spread risk across many institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liftoff claims 140,000 apps use its services. It says it had 2025 revenues of over $519 million and a net loss of just over $48 million. The company also says it is carrying over $1.85 billion in debt.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

It could also do other things, like require that people who join a product-focused community verify they actually own or use the product being discussed there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an example, a community for Oura ring owners could verify that everyone who posts has proven they own one of the smart rings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, Rose suggests Digg could use signals acquired from mobile devices to help verify members — for instance, the app could identify when Digg users attended a meetup in the same location.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think there’s going to be any one silver bullet here,” said Rose. “It’s just going to be us saying … here’s a platter of things that you can add together to create trust.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before today’s public beta launch, the site offered 21 more generalized communities like gaming, technology, and entertainment, and was open to 67,000 users on an invite-only basis. Now anyone will be able to join and start their own communities on nearly any topic, no matter how niche — a top request from beta testers. The community managers (i.e., moderators) for these individual forums will be able to set their own rules, and their moderation logs will be shared publicly, so members can see what decisions are being made.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082759\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Digg</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The site has also been redesigned since its private beta, now offering a new sidebar where you can pin your favorite communities and a main feed optimized for visual elements. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, communities will only have one manager, but that will change in time, as the company adds more features, including those to customize the look and feel and functionality of individual communities with integrations and other tools. For instance, a movie reviews community could include scores from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Letterboxd</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We kind of opted for … let’s just keep building this plane as we fly it,” explained Digg CEO Justin Mezzell. “That means that it’s going to be very lightweight, and we’re just going to be aggressively shipping every week and just giving them new features as we go,” he added.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082686\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Digg</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also plans to listen to its community managers about what they need and build accordingly, and it has brought on some Reddit moderators as advisers. Although Reddit was built on the back of volunteer moderators, Digg aims to find a model that improves the moderator experience. Plans on this front haven’t been fleshed out yet, however, but Mezzell said it “has to be a conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to figure out a way to make this an equitable experience for everybody who’s actually building Digg into what it needs to become,” he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the team is considering shifting its AI-created podcast about the interesting stories surfacing on Digg into a human-hosted version, as users have been requesting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rose told TechCrunch that the current team is small, giving them “years of runway” to find product-market fit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The beautiful thing about this launch is we’re finally at the place with Digg where it’s just that the foundational stuff is done, and now we can really start having fun,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Note: The rollout should begin around 4 PM ET</em>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The update is rolling out on desktop starting today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trends Explore page has long served as a valuable tool for content creators, journalists, and researchers, making it easy to analyze search interest for any topic over time, across regions, and by category. The new Gemini experience streamlines much of the manual work involved in exploring trending topics, reducing research time, and surfacing connections that users might otherwise overlook.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The redesigned Explore page now features a side panel that automatically identifies and compares relevant trends in your area of interest. Users will also see a list of suggested Gemini prompts to help with deeper exploration. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082718\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png 2148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=1200,791 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=1280,844 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=430,283 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=720,475 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=900,593 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=800,527 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=2048,1350 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=668,440 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=569,375 569w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=936,617 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=708,467 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GeminiGoogleTrends.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The page features a refreshed design, with dedicated icons and colors for each search term, making it easier to match them to their corresponding lines on the graph. Additionally, Google increased the number of terms users can compare and doubled the number of rising queries displayed on each timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Google blog post uses trending dog breeds as an example to illustrate the new capabilities. The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings. The company has already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-unveils-new-ai-features-coming-to-gmail-docs-and-vids/\">added AI capabilities</a> to Search, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/29/gmail-users-on-android-can-now-chat-with-gemini-about-their-emails/\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/google-maps-bakes-in-gemini-to-improve-navigation-and-hands-free-use/\">Maps</a>, and Docs.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
