One app gaining traction is <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">UpScrolled</a>, a social network that pledges to remain impartial to political agendas. The app currently ranks 12th overall in Apple’s App Store and second in the social networking category.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Upscrolled</a> blends familiar features from Instagram and X, letting users share photos, videos, and text posts, discover new content, and send direct messages. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app was founded last year by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist, with the aim of giving users a place to “freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,” according to the <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">app’s website</a>. The team behind the app says they’re “building a platform that belongs to the people who use it — not to hidden algorithms or outside agendas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“UpScrolled is the foundation for a digital ecosystem that puts power back into the hands of the people — not the corporations,” Hijazi says in a statement on UpScrolled’s website. “It’s more than just an alternative to Meta, X, or TikTok — it’s a reimagining of what social media should be: a space where creators, communities, and businesses thrive independently, with real control, transparency, and accountability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app, available on both <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/upscrolled/id6746533451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.upscrolled.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Android</a>, is grappling with a surge of new users, but says it’s scaling to keep up with the demand. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to data from the market intelligence provider <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://appfigures.com\">Appfigures</a>, UpScrolled saw approximately 41,000 downloads between Thursday, the day the TikTok deal was finalized, and Saturday, accounting for nearly one-third of its lifetime installs. UpScrolled has seen an average of about 14,000 daily downloads since Thursday, representing a 2,850% increase in daily downloads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the app has been downloaded 140,000 times to date, with 75,000 of those being U.S.-based installs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Well, this is new… You showed up so fast our servers tapped out,” the company <a href=\"https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2015797730241601808\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a post</a> on Bluesky. “Frustrating? Yes. Emotional? Also yes. We’re a tiny team building what Big Tech stopped being. Right now we’re scaling on caffeine to keep up with what YOU started. Bear with us. We’re on it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The surge comes as TikTok announced last Thursday that it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-finalizes-deal-to-create-new-us-entity-and-avoid-ban/\">signed a deal</a> with a group of non-Chinese investors to form a majority American-owned joint venture to keep the social app operating in the U.S. TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new entity, while the venture’s three managing investors, Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment company MGX, each hold a 15% stake. Some users worry that TikTok’s new U.S. investors may have political allegiances to Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Following the takeover, some users accused the app of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2026/01/26/are-new-owners-censoring-tiktok-top-democrats-influencers-celebrities-raising-concerns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">potentially censoring certain political content</a>. This criticism included a handful of high-profile users, including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/2015582789647597939?s=20\">Senator Chris Murphy</a> and singer Billie Eilish, who raised concerns that TikTok was suppressing or limiting posts criticizing ICE. Additionally, some said they were unable to search for information about ongoing protests in Minneapolis following the killing of Alex Pretti by border patrol agents. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, TikTok attributed these issues to an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/\">ongoing data center outage</a>, which has been impacting its app’s functionality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Concerns also grew when TikTok released an updated privacy policy that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/\">allows</a> the app to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. This led to some users encouraging people to delete the app in favor of alternatives, with UpScrolled being one of the popular choices, largely due to its <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">promise to not shadowban</a> anyone and give “every post a fair chance to be seen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UpScrolled isn’t the only app that’s seeing a surge in users following the takeover. Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on open source technology, says it has now topped <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-alternative-skylight-soars-to-380k-users-after-tiktok-u-s-deal-finalized/\">over 380,000 sign-ups</a> and is continuing to grow.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The first bid came in at $8 million, and parties traded bids until Life Electric Vehicles came away as the winner. When accounting for Rad Power’s liabilities, the total value of the bid is $14.9 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another e-bike company called Retrospec had the second-highest bid of $13 million, and is being labeled as the “backup bidder” in case the deal with Life EV falls through. The bids were a steep discount to Rad Power’s peak $1.65 billion valuation, which was reached in Otober 2021, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/112199-50/company/profile#ai-summary\">per PitchBook</a>. The company has raised a total $329.2 million, according to Pitchbook data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy judge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power is not the only company in the micromobility world to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years. Peers like VanMoof and Cake went through restructurings and found new owners. Scooter company Bird also went through the bankruptcy process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear what Life EV plans to do with Rad Power; Life EV CEO Robert Provost directed questions to Rad Power. “There is still a process underway and there is an exciting future being planned for Rad Power,” he wrote in a message.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch was unable to reach Rad Power for comment; this article will be updated if the company responds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like many of those peers, Rad Power saw a huge increase in sales during the pandemic, but struggled as that momentum dried up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company went through multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years, juggled CEOs, and more recently had trouble with some of its older batteries catching fire. The Consumer Product Safety Commission found 31 reported fires tied to the batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power told TechCrunch at the time that it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, founders Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles are tasked with a bigger challenge: showing customers and investors how this AI-powered software layer translates to real savings on an industrial scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York-based startup has had some success following its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/this-industrial-ai-startup-is-winning-over-customers-by-saying-it-wont-get-acquired/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pre-seed funding round</a> last July. Its system is now running with real customers, including public utilities, advanced manufacturing facilities, and chemical producers. It’s given the duo more concrete examples of what problems they can solve — and money they can save — for their big industry clients.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the core things we’re witnessing,” he said, is customers “really lack the tool to translate a small action, like turning on and off a valve, [into] did that just save me money?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a homeowner with bills to pay, it’s a bit unnerving to think about one nondescript valve making such a big difference in the bottom line of a company and its customers. But it’s examples like this that helped CVector reach a new milestone, as it has now closed a $5 million seed round, Zhang and Ruggles told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The financing was led by Powerhouse Ventures and included a mix of venture and strategic backing, with participation from early stage funds like Fusion Fund and Myriad Venture Partners, as well as Hitachi’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/hitachi-ventures-raises-400m-fund-to-invest-in-everything-from-fusion-to-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">corporate venture arm</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the funding round closed, CVector is talking a bit more about some of its first customers — and just how different they are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “The joy of the last, say, six to eight months has been going to the industrial heartland, to all of these places that are just in the middle of nowhere, but have massive production plants that are either reinventing themselves or really transforming how they make decisions,” Zhang said in an interview.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of those customers is a metals processing company based in Iowa called ATEK Metal Technologies, which makes aluminum castings for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, among other things. CVector is doing things like helping spot potential problems that could lead to equipment downtime, monitor the whole plant’s energy efficiency, and keep an eye on commodity prices that impact raw material cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That is, to me, such a good example where this is really skilled labor, and they will need all the help they can get from for us, from the software side, from technology side, to really help that group of people transform, take the business to the next level so they can keep growing,” Zhang said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finding optimizations in older plants might seem like the most obvious path for a company like CVector. But it has also picked up startups as customers, too, including Ammobia, a materials science startup based in San Francisco that is working to lower the cost of making ammonia. And yet the work CVector is doing for Ammobia is surprisingly similar to what it’s doing for ATEK, Zhang said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CVector is also growing. The company is up to 12 people, and it’s locked down its first physical office in the financial district in Manhattan. Zhang said he’s been attracting talent from the worlds of fintech and finance, especially hedge funds. The latter is ripe for recruiting, he said, since the people who work in the hedge fund industry are already pretty focused on using data to gain a financial edge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s the core of our sales pitch, it’s what we call ‘operational economics,’” Zhang said. “We position it to sit between the operation of the plant and the actual economics — the margin of how much you’re making money.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zhang still sees public utilities as a great place to apply CVector’s technology, though. (That’s where the valve example came from.) And he’s found that even these types of customers have become far more fluent in talking about the kinds of work CVector does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Tyler and I were just talking about how when we first started company almost exactly a year ago, it was still like a taboo to talk about AI in general. There was a 50/50 chance if the customer would embrace AI or just kind of discredit you, right?” he said. “But now, over the especially last six months, everyone is asking for more AI-native solutions, even when sometimes the ROI calculation might not be clear. This kind of adoption craze is real.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ruggles said that’s in large part because what CVector does ultimately comes down to one thing: money. And with so much uncertainty in the world, managing costs has only gotten harder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re at this time when companies are really intimately worried about their supply chain and the costs and variability there, and being able to kind of layer AI on top [to make] economic model of a facility, it’s really resonated with a lot of customers, whether it’s old and industrial in the heartland, or whether it’s new energy producers who are trying to do new and novel things,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, however, some of TikTok’s users are more worried about the new American investors and their allegiance to Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those concerns grew to a head when TikTok pushed out an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">updated privacy policy</a>, which includes permission to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. Users also pointed to language in the privacy policy that said the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">app would track immigration status</a>. Although that language was not new, and its inclusion has to do with adherence to state privacy laws, some users began encouraging people to delete the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s unknown how many TikTok users actually followed through, what is clear is that some people sought out alternatives. Over the weekend, Skylight’s CEO, Tori White, said the app added around 20,000 new users and is continuing to grow. So far this January, the app has seen around 95,000 monthly active users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">White credited the app’s more open and customizable nature as the force behind its growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Skylight has made notable gains, it’s still overshadowed by TikTok and its 200 million monthly active U.S. users. Still, Skylight’s founders believe their approach provides an opening for growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen what happens when one person dictates what’s pushed into people’s feeds,” White told TechCrunch. “Not only does it harm a creator’s connection with their followers, but the entire health of the platform. That’s why we built Skylight Social on open standards. We wanted creator and user power to be guaranteed by the technology. Not an empty promise, but an irrevocable right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In each case, the app will enable a logged-in instance of the service that’s accessible to Claude, enabling users to send Slack messages, generate charts, or access cloud files, depending on which apps have been enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Analyzing data, designing content, and managing projects all work better with a dedicated visual interface,” Anthropic said in a blog post announcing the feature. “Combined with Claude’s intelligence, you can work and iterate faster than either could offer alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature is available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscribers, but not free users. Eligible users can activate the tools at <a href=\"http://claude.ai/directory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claude.ai/directory</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system is similar to OpenAI’s Apps system, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched in October</a> and enables interactive third-party tools. Both systems of app integrations are built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024. MCP launched <a href=\"https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-21-mcp-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">support for apps in November</a>, drawing on work from both companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new apps will be particularly powerful when integrated with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropics-new-cowork-tool-offers-claude-code-without-the-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Claude Cowork</a>, an all-purpose agent tool launched by Anthropic last week. Built on top of Claude Code, Cowork lets users assign multistage tasks that draw on large and open-ended datasets — tasks that would have previously required terminal commands. Combined with the new apps feature, Cowork could be granted access to cloud files or ongoing work projects. For example, Cowork could update a marketing graphic in Figma or use new data from the company’s Box instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apps are not available in Cowork at launch, but Anthropic said the integration would be “coming soon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agentic systems can be unpredictable, and <a href=\"https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anthropic’s own safety documentation</a> for Cowork encourages users to monitor the agent closely and not grant any unnecessary permissions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records,” the company recommends. “Consider creating a dedicated working folder for Claude rather than granting broad access.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The third was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/obvious-ventures-closes-an-irrationally-sized-third-fund/\">$271,828,182</a> (which mathematicians and engineers instantly recognize as e, or Euler’s number), while the fourth fund, announced in mid-2022, continued the tradition as another palindrome at $355,111,553.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you haven’t guessed it by now, the meaning of Obvious Ventures newest fund size is a little less about geeky math and more about the firm’s investing philosophy. Twelve years into its journey, Obvious says the figure represents a full-circle perspective on its three broad focus areas: planetary health, human health, and economic health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We love the metaphor of taking a 360-degree view in each of those areas,” Joaquin said. “You have to be a student of the past to understand what’s worked and what hasn’t worked.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s working for the firm, according to Joaquin, is keeping its fund sizes small enough so that a single investment, if it becomes a durable public company, has the opportunity to return the entire fund. Joaquin likely placed an emphasis on durability in part because Obvious Venture’s initial winners, Beyond Meat, reached a market capitalization of over <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/boom-bust-beyond-meat-struggles-stay-relevant-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$14 billion</a> shortly after its 2019 IPO, but had fallen to below a billion by <a href=\"https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:BYND/explorer/marketcap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">late 2022</a>.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Joaquin says the firm has seen meaningful cash distributions to limited partners from all of its core funds, and it boasts several companies with successful public-market exits. In 2015, Obvious Ventures invested in the satellite imagery company Planet Labs, which went public via a SPAC in 2021 and is currently valued at approximately $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, its Series A investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals maintains a market capitalization of over $2 billion.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obvious is also an early investor in the HR and payroll platform Gusto, which was most recently valued at more than <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/06/09/gusto-200-million-plus-tender-offer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$9 billion</a> in the private market and is widely considered to be on an IPO trajectory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a venture capital environment where only <a href=\"https://x.com/Beezer232/status/2014730309049164169\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">17% of firms</a> successfully raise more than three funds, per research from Sapphire Partners, Obvious Ventures’ latest fundraise solidifies the firm as an established VC player.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We made it to fund five, which is actually a big deal in the venture landscape,” Joaquin said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obvious Ventures may take a playful approach to fund sizes, but its focus on investing in startups that make a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/24/its-not-so-obvious-that-this-vc-firm-is-focused-on-impact/\">positive impact</a> on the world is serious. Joaquin pointed to several investments in each of the firm’s three pillars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the planetary health sector, the firm invested in Zanskar, a startup using proprietary data and AI to identify and harness geothermal energy, one of the most cost-effective power sources available. Just last week, Zanskar announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/zanskar-thinks-1-tw-of-geothermal-power-is-being-overlooked/\">$115 million</a> Series C. Obvious Ventures, which led the company’s previous round, is particularly excited about the investment. Joaquin noted that the geothermal power harnessed by Zanskar can help fuel energy-hungry AI data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its human health strategy, Obvious Ventures touted its investment in Inceptive, an AI platform for molecule development. Inceptive was founded by Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the primary authors of the seminal “Attention is All You Need” paper, which introduced the transformer architecture, the breakthrough behind generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the area of economic health, Joaquin pointed to Dexterity Robotics. The company, which was at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/yet-another-ai-robotics-firm-lands-major-funding-as-dexterity-closes-latest-round/\">$1.65 billion</a> last year, builds humanoids to handle “dull, dirty, and dangerous” jobs tasks currently performed by humans in warehouses and factories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to Joaquin, Obvious Ventures has four active investors, including co-founder Vishal Vasishth. (Ev Williams remains a co-founder and an adviser.) The firm intends to make approximately 10 investments annually, with check sizes ranging from $5 million to $12 million for Seed and Series A startups.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For some users, the problems continue to persist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of these outages lines up with the long-awaited creation of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/heres-whats-you-should-know-about-the-us-tiktok-deal/\">separate U.S. TikTok entity</a> last week, which the U.S. government mandated due to concerns about the Chinese government potentially accessing user data via the app’s former parent company, ByteDance. (Now, ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new TikTok USDS Joint Venture, while managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX own 15% each.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the TikTok USDS Joint Venture stated in a <a href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2015807214871535741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2015807214871535741%7Ctwgr%5E2dc1cf92171256fc340be788c3196b4a78c8c746%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D3086046action%3Dedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">post</a> on X that these issues were caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,” the company <a href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2015807214871535741\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a>. “We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/tiktok/map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">user-reported data</a> from Downdetector, the outage is impacting users across the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok’s reasoning for the glitches is logical, given that more than one million people in the U.S. have been impacted by power outages after the massive storm. But some users are suspicious given how soon the outages occurred after the U.S. joint venture was formally established.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The outage also overlaps with ongoing protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2000-federal-agents-sent-to-minneapolis-area-to-carry-out-largest-immigration-operation-ever-ice-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands</a> of ICE agents have been deployed since early January in what ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons called the “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2026-01-07/dhs-deploys-2-000-officers-in-minnesota-to-carry-out-its-largest-immigration-operation-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">largest immigration operation ever</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Saturday, border patrol agents <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/minute-minute-timeline-fatal-shooting-alex-pretti-federal/story?id=129547199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shot and killed Alex Pretti</a>, marking ICE’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Ren%C3%A9e_Good\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">second murder</a> of a civilian in Minneapolis this month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the wake of the killing, some TikTok users said they had trouble searching on the app for information about the events in Minneapolis. The app malfunctions then led to panic about the possibility of government censorship. However, TikTok attributes these issues to its concurrent data center outage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People had also expressed concern over the weekend about TikTok’s updated privacy policy, which includes language that allows TikTok to collect data about users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.” However, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\">as TechCrunch reported</a>, some of these disclosures are not new and had appeared in TikTok’s privacy policy <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260121054327/https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prior</a> to the ownership deal’s close, primarily to comply with California’s Consumer Privacy Act.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the recent TikTok outages and privacy policy changes seem to be run-of-the-mill problems with bad timing, Americans do have reason to be cautious about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/eff-unions-sue-trump-administration-over-alleged-mass-social-media-surveillance-of-legal-residents/\">social media surveillance</a> — especially in times of political unrest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s cheaper, faster, and more independent from geopolitics.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That dual focus has helped 2150 raise a new €210 million second fund from a range of institutional investors and family funds, including Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, Church Pension Group, the Danish sovereign fund EIFO, Fund of Funds Carbon Equity, Novo Holdings, Islandbridge Capital, Security Trading Oy, and Viessmann Generations Group. The new fund brings the European firm’s assets under management to €500 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the new fund has 34 limited partners, said Christian Hernandez, co-founder and partner at 2150. “Pretty meaty checks,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, 2150 has invested in seven companies from the new fund, including <a href=\"https://atmoszero.energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AtmosZero</a>, which makes industrial heat pumps; <a href=\"https://getmobil.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GetMobil</a>, an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/getmobil-raises-funding/\">e-waste recycling startup</a>; <a href=\"https://metycle.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Metycle</a>, a scrap and recyclable metals marketplace; and <a href=\"https://www.missionzero.tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MissionZero</a>, a direct air capture startup. Three others have yet to be announced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, 2150 is looking to invest in 20 companies in the second fund. Most startups it writes checks to will be raising Series A rounds, and the checks will total around €5 million to €6 million, Hernandez said. Half of the fund will be reserved for follow-on investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partners said they’ll be looking for a range of startups, similar to before. Specifically, though, they’re excited by opportunities in data centers and automation, both of which have been spurred by the recent surge in AI.

The Netherlands already has 50% of their population over the age of 50. So what role does industrial automation help with helping those people be productive, but also generating GDP and funding those people’s pensions?” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bro said the focus on industrial applications was perhaps obvious in hindsight. “Cities are all supplied by large or small industries at the end of the day,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The focus appears to be paying off. 2150’s portfolio companies mitigated one megaton of carbon emissions last year, Hernandez said. “The fact that a small venture capital fund can already get to the megaton-level scale in only four years, that level of impact, along with the commercial traction, makes me feel like we’re doing the right thing.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Maia comes equipped with over 100 billion transistors, delivering over 10 petaflops in 4-bit precision and approximately 5 petaflops of 8-bit performance — a substantial increase over its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inference refers to the computing process of running a model, in contrast with the compute required to train it. As AI companies mature, inference costs have become an increasingly important part of their overall operating cost, leading to renewed interest in ways to optimize the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft is hoping that the Maia 200 can be part of that optimization, making AI businesses run with less disruption and lower power use. “In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,” the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s new chip is also part of a growing trend of tech giants turning to self-designed chips as a way to lessen their dependence on Nvidia, whose <a href=\"https://observer.com/2025/12/google-ai-chip-tpu-nvidia-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cutting-edge GPUs </a>have become increasingly pivotal to AI companies’ success. Google, for instance, has its TPU, the tensor processing units — which aren’t sold as chips but <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/07/googles-decade-long-bet-on-tpus-companys-secret-weapon-in-ai-race.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as compute power made accessible through its cloud</a>. Then there’s Amazon Trainium, the e-commerce giant’s own AI accelerator chip, which <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/amazons-custom-chips-pose-another-threat-to-nvidia-8aa19f5b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfRj9f6kiXIEVEI7trLmnZNL3IUzAQE5Lstsy-bO05Um44DpK0nrknU3c-XP1k%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6973d4fd&amp;gaa_sig=7ox5mp-GoK1ZnGNXTFKypquHIGRzwH0ZjYwuauc7G_nOSdYP9YWTywvH7xODgaRlnF2aFemAAcsCQ_zhbM4Upg%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">just launched its latest version</a>, the Trainium3, in December. In each case, the TPUs can be used to offload some of the compute that would otherwise be assigned to Nvidia GPUs, lessening the overall hardware cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Maia, Microsoft is positioning itself to compete with those alternatives. In its press release Monday, the company noted that Maia delivers 3x the FP4 performance of third-generation Amazon Trainium chips, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft says that Maia is already hard at work fueling the company’s AI models from its Superintelligence team. It has also been supporting the operations of Copilot, its chatbot. As of Monday, the company said it has invited a variety of parties — including developers, academics, and frontier AI labs — to use its Maia 200 software development kit in their workloads.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Crucially, the company plans to use Starship V3 to launch its next-generation Starlink satellites, which will be capable of faster data speeds but weigh more and are larger. It’s also the first version of the rocket that is meant to dock with other Starships in Earth orbit, a capability the company needs in order to reach the moon or Mars.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This all comes as SpaceX is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-elon-musk-is-racing-to-take-spacex-public-38f3de9b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfq0GfzojoJ-k3M7XZBNp__L48XVCpA0_sqJY4wLcZuGqsMGks9anL8I2wHfwM%3D&amp;gaa_ts=697780c0&amp;gaa_sig=pAYkhG2WVQzZ8OQxNyY9mDBVhWjsopXzG5vt-lfpYqRv0cdDx4LO9CQBP38AO1Oa4hZxqtvrHn_Domszvfpm3Q%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">racing toward an IPO later this year</a>, and under pressure from the Trump administration to return U.S. astronauts to the surface of the moon before the end of his second term. Starship, the most powerful rocket ever developed, is currently a key part of NASA’s mission to fulfill that goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX was making progress toward a launch of Starship V3 in late 2025. But in November, the booster stage suffered an explosion during testing that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/spacexs-upgraded-starship-suffers-explosion-during-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blew out an entire side of the steel rocket</a>. The company said it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened, but has yet to offer a more detailed breakdown of what went wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been hoping to move on from the second version of Starship, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spacex-wraps-action-packed-starship-v2-era-as-program-moves-to-v3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was a mixed bag</a>. It was able to successfully reach orbit with Starship V2, deploy dummy versions of the next-generation Starlink satellites, and catch multiple booster stages after they returned to the launchpad. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Starship V2 also suffered a number of explosions and setbacks of its own. Some of those came as a result of SpaceX’s developmental approach, which involves pushing the test vehicles to — or past — their limit and then iterating based on what the company learns. Others were more unexpected, like when one of the Starship vehicles that sits atop the booster stage erupted in a massive fireball during <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/19/spacexs-starship-blows-up-ahead-of-10th-test-flight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ground testing last June</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has come to dominate the global launch market over the last decade, and it is relying on Starship to maintain that dominance. But competition is creeping in at the edges. Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin launched its first mega-rocket, known as New Glenn, for the first time in January 2025 and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/blue-origin-sticks-first-new-glenn-rocket-landing-and-launches-nasa-spacecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">again in November</a>. The company launched its inaugural commercial payload for NASA on that second flight and also completed the first landing of its booster stage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blue Origin is planning a third launch of New Glenn <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/blue-origin-schedules-third-new-glenn-launch-for-late-february-but-not-to-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in late February</a> and hopes to send its own lunar lander to the moon sometime after that. While New Glenn is smaller than Starship, Blue Origin revealed late last year that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/blue-origin-reveals-a-super-heavy-variant-of-its-new-glenn-rocket-that-is-taller-than-a-saturn-v/\">it is developing a larger version</a> of the vehicle that more directly competes with SpaceX’s super-heavy rocket. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Or, given how accurate the company claims the new models are, maybe it knew something we didn’t?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new AI models promise to make weather forecasting faster and more accurate. Nvidia claims that one model in particular, Earth-2 Medium Range, beats Google DeepMind’s AI weather model, GenCast, on more than 70 variables. GenCast, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/07/google-says-its-new-ai-model-outperforms-the-top-weather-forecast-system/\">which Google released in December 2024</a>, was itself significantly more accurate than existing weather models that were capable of generating forecasts up to 15 days out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia announced the new tools Monday at the American Meteorological Society meeting in Houston.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Philosophically, scientifically, it’s a return to simplicity,” Mike Pritchard, director of climate simulation at Nvidia, told reporters on a call before the meeting. “We’re moving away from hand-tailored niche AI architectures and leaning into the future of simple, scalable, transformer architectures.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditionally, most weather forecasts rely on simulations of physics as observed in the real world. AI models are a relatively recent addition. The Earth-2 Medium Range model is based on a new Nvidia architecture called Atlas, about which the company said it would release more details on Monday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside Medium Range, Nvidia’s Earth-2 suite includes a Nowcasting model and Global Data Assimilation model.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nowcasting produces short-term predictions from zero to six hours into the future, and it’s aimed at helping meteorologists forecast the impacts of storms and other hazardous weather. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because this model is trained directly on globally available geostationary satellite observations, rather than region-specific physics model outputs, Nowcasting’s approach can be adapted anywhere on the planet with good satellite coverage,” Pritchard said. That should help governments of states and smaller countries understand how severe weather systems might affect their territories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Global Data Assimilation model uses data from sources like weather stations and balloons to produce continuous snapshots of weather conditions at thousands of locations around the world. Those snapshots are then used as launching points for weather models to make their predictions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditionally, those snapshots have required tremendous amounts of computing power before the forecasting work could begin. “It consumes roughly 50% of the total supercomputing loads of traditional weather [forecasting],” Pritchard said. “This model can do that in minutes on GPUs instead of hours on supercomputers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The three new models join two existing ones: CorrDiff, which uses coarse-grained forecasts to generate speedy, high-resolution predictions, and FourCastNet 3, which models individual weather variables like temperature, wind, and humidity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pritchard said that the new models should give more users access to powerful weather forecasting tools, which have historically been the domain of wealthier countries and large corporations, which have the funds to pay for costly supercomputer time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This provides the fundamental building blocks used by everyone in the ecosystem — national meteorological services, financial service firms, energy companies — anyone who wants to build and refine weather forecasting models,” Pritchard said. Some of the tools are already in use. Meteorologists in Israel and Taiwan have been using Earth-2 CorrDiff, for example, while The Weather Company and Total Energies are evaluating Nowcasting, Nvidia said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For some users, it makes sense to subscribe to an enterprise centralized weather forecasting system. But for others like countries, sovereignty matters,” Pritchard said. “Weather is a national security issue, and sovereignty and weather are inseparable.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With enterprise clients including Bosch, Merck, and SAP, the London-based company crossed <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.synthesia.io/post/100-million-revenue-adobe-investment\">$100 million in annual recurring revenue</a> (ARR) in April 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This milestone explains why Synthesia’s venture backers are literally doubling down. The Series E that nearly doubled its valuation was led by existing investor GV (Google Ventures), with participation from several other previous backers — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/synthesia-raises-50m-to-leverage-synthetic-avatars-for-corporate-training-and-more/\">Series B lead Kleiner Perkins</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/14/synthesia-secures-90m-for-ai-that-generates-custom-avatars/\">Series C lead Accel</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/synthesia-snaps-up-180m-on-a-2-1b-valuation-for-its-b2b-ai-video-platform/\">Series D lead New Enterprise Associates (NEA)</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/nvidias-ai-empire-a-look-at-its-top-startup-investments/\">Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures</a>, Air Street Capital, and PSP Growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from ongoing support, this round will bring both new and departing investors. On one hand, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/former-sequoia-partner-matt-miller-raises-355m-for-new-fund-with-sequoias-backing/\">Matt Miller’s VC firm Evantic</a> and the <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/hedosophia-raises-secondaries-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">secretive VC firm Hedosophia</a> are joining the cap table as new entrants. On the other hand, Synthesia will facilitate an employee secondary sale in partnership with Nasdaq, TechCrunch has learned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, Synthesia isn’t going public just yet — Nasdaq isn’t acting as a public exchange in this operation, but as a private markets facilitator that will help early team members turn their shares into cash. These employee stock sales often happen outside of this framework, but usually at prices either below or above the company’s official valuation, and are sometimes frowned upon by other shareholders. With this process, all sales will be tied to the same $4 billion valuation as Synthesia’s Series E, while the company keeps an element of control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This secondary is first and foremost about our employees,” Synthesia CFO Daniel Kim told TechCrunch. “It gives employees a meaningful opportunity to access liquidity and share in the value they’ve helped create, while we continue to operate as a private company focused on long-term growth.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Synthesia, this long-term growth involves going beyond <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/25/watch-it-and-weep-or-smile-synthesias-ai-video-avatars-now-feature-emotions/\">expressive videos</a> and embracing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/no-one-knows-what-the-hell-an-ai-agent-is/\">the AI agents trend</a>. According to a press release, the company is developing AI agents that will let its clients’ employees “interact with company knowledge in a more intuitive, human-like way by asking questions, exploring scenarios through role-play, and receiving tailored explanations.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said early pilots have received positive feedback from customers, who reported higher engagement and faster knowledge transfer compared to traditional formats. This positive response explains why Synthesia now plans to make agents a “core strategic focus” to invest in, alongside further product improvements to its existing platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it didn’t disclose revenue forecasts, the company hopes its platform will offer a welcome answer to the struggles of enterprises in keeping their workforce adequately trained despite rapid changes. “We see a rare convergence of two major shifts: a technology shift with AI agents becoming more capable, and a market shift where upskilling and internal knowledge sharing have become board-level priorities,” Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO Victor Riparbelli said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seeing boards care more about employees as a result of AI wasn’t on anyone’s bingo card, except perhaps Riparbelli. Together with his co-founder, Synthesia COO Steffen Tjerrild, Riparbelli took the initiative of conducting a secondary sale so that employees could share in the success of the unicorn company. Founded in 2017, Synthesia now has more than 500 team members, a <a href=\"https://www.synthesia.io/post/introducing-our-new-london-headquarters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">20,000-square-foot HQ in London</a>, and additional offices in Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, New York City, and Zurich.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While unusual for a British startup, this coordinated secondary sale isn’t a first and likely not a last, Synthesia’s head of corporate affairs and policy, Alexandru Voica told TechCrunch. “My guess is that as [U.K.-based] private companies stay private longer, this type of structured, cross-border employee liquidity may become increasingly common, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see others do it, either with Nasdaq or others,” he predicted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

His company builds fire nozzles — specifically, nozzles that it says put out fires up to three times faster than earlier products while conserving two-thirds of the water. But Sethi is matter-of-fact about this achievement, more focused on what’s next than what’s already been done. And what’s next sounds a lot bigger than fire nozzles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His path to firefighting doesn’t follow a tidy narrative. After nabbing his PhD at the University of Akron, where he researched surfaces and adhesion, he founded ADAP Nanotech, an outfit that developed a carbon nanotube-based portfolio and won Air Force Research Lab grants. Next, at SunPower, he developed new materials and processes for shingled photovoltaic modules. When he landed next at a company called TE Connectivity, he worked on devices with new adhesive formulations to enable faster manufacturing in the automotive industry.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then came a challenge from his wife. The two had moved from Ohio to the East Bay outside San Francisco in 2013. A few years later came the Thomas Fire — the only megafire they’d ever see, they thought. Then came the Camp Fire, then the Napa-Sonoma fires. The breaking point came in 2019. Sethi was traveling during evacuation warnings while his wife was home alone with their then three-year-old daughter, no family nearby, facing a potential evacuation order. “She was really mad at me,” Sethi recalls. “She’s like, ‘Dude, you need to fix this, otherwise you’re not a real scientist.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A background spanning nanotechnology, solar, semiconductors, and automotive had made his thinking “bias-free and flexible,” as he puts it. He’d seen so many industries, so many different problems. Why <em>not</em> try to fix the problem?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2020, he founded HEN Technologies (for high-efficiency nozzles) in nearby Hayward. With National Science Foundation funding, he conducted computational fluid dynamics research, analyzing how water suppresses fire and how wind affects it. The result: a nozzle that controls droplet size precisely, manages velocity in new ways, and resists wind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In HEN’s comparison video, which Sethi shows me over a Zoom call, the difference is stark. It’s the same flow rate, he says, but HEN’s pattern and velocity control keep the stream coherent while traditional nozzles disperse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the nozzle is just the beginning — what Sethi calls “the muscle on the ground.” HEN has since expanded into monitors, valves, overhead sprinklers, and pressure devices, and is launching a flow-control device (“Stream IQ”) and discharge control systems this year. According to Sethi, each device contains custom-designed circuit boards with sensors and computing power — 23 different designs that turn dumb hardware into smart, connected equipment, some powered by Nvidia Orion Nano processors. Altogether, says Sethi, HEN has filed 20 patent applications with half a dozen granted so far.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The real innovation is the system these devices create. HEN’s platform uses sensors at the pump to act as a virtual sensor in the nozzle, tracking exactly when it’s on, how much water flows, and what pressure is required. The system captures precisely how much water was used for a given fire, how it was used, which hydrant was tapped, and what the weather conditions were.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why it matters: Fire departments can run out of water otherwise, because there’s no communication between water suppliers and firefighters. It happened in the Palisades Fire. It happened in the Oakland Fire decades earlier. When two engines are connected to one hydrant, pressure variations can mean that one engine suddenly gets nothing as a fire continues to grow. In rural America, water tenders, which are tankers shuttling water from distant sources, face their own logistical nightmares. If they can integrate water usage calculations with their own utility monitoring systems to optimize resource allocation, that’s a giant win.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So HEN built a cloud platform with application layers, which Sethi likens to what Adobe did with cloud infrastructure. Think Individual à la carte systems for fire captains, battalion chiefs, and incident commanders. HEN’s system has weather data; it has GPS in all devices. It can warn those on the front lines that the wind is about to shift and they’d better move their engines, or that a particular fire truck is running out of water.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085907\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00797.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>HEN Technologies</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Department of Homeland Security has been asking for exactly this kind of system through its <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/nfirs/neris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NERIS program</a>, which is an initiative to bring predictive analytics to emergency operations. “But you can’t have [predictive analytics] unless you have good-quality data,” Sethi notes. “You can’t have good-quality data unless you have the right hardware.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If building a predictive analytics platform for emergency response sounds daunting, Sethi says actually selling it is tougher, and he’s proudest of HEN’s traction on that front.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The hardest part of building this company is that this market is tough because it’s a B2C play when you think of convincing the customers to buy, but the procurement cycle is B2B,” he explains. “So you have to really make a product that resonates with people — with the end user — but you still have to go through government purchasing cycles, and we have cracked both of those.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers bear this out. HEN launched its first products into the market in the second quarter of 2023, lining up 10 fire departments and generating $200,000 in revenue. Then word started to spread. Revenue hit $1.6 million in 2024, then $5.2 million last year. This year, Hen, which currently has 1,500 fire department customers, is projecting $20 million in revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HEN has competition, of course. IDEX Corp, a public company, sells hoses, nozzles, and monitors. Software companies like Central Square serve fire departments. A Miami company, First Due, which sells software to public safety agencies, announced a massive <a href=\"https://www.firstdue.com/news/investment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$355 million round</a> last August. But no company is “doing exactly what we are trying to do,” insists Sethi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, Sethi says that the constraint isn’t demand — it’s scaling fast enough. HEN serves the Marine Corps, U.S. Army bases, Naval atomic labs, NASA, and Abu Dhabi Civil Defense, and ships to 22 countries. It works through 120 distributors and recently qualified for GSA after a year-long vetting process (that’s a federal seal of approval that makes it easier for military and government agencies to buy).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fire departments buy about 20,000 new engines each year to replace aging equipment in a national fleet of 200,000, so once HEN is qualified, it becomes recurring revenue (is the idea), and because the hardware generates data, revenue continues between purchase cycles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HEN’s dual goal has required building a very specific team. Its software lead was formerly a senior director who helped build Adobe’s cloud infrastructure. Other members of HEN’s 50-person team include a former NASA engineer and veterans from Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft. “If you ask me technical questions, I would not be able to answer everything,” Sethi admits with a laugh, “but I have such good teams that [it] has been a blessing.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, it’s the software that hints at where this gets interesting, because while HEN is selling nozzles, it’s amassing something more valuable: data. Highly specific, real-world data about how water behaves under pressure, how flow rates interact with materials, how fire responds to suppression techniques, how physics works in active fire environments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s exactly what companies building so-called world models need. These AI systems that construct simulated representations of physical environments to predict future states require real-world, multimodal data from physical systems under extreme conditions. You can’t teach AI about physics through simulations alone. You need what HEN collects with every deployment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sethi won’t elaborate, but he knows what he’s sitting on. Companies training robotics and predictive physics engines would pay handsomely for this kind of information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors see it, too. <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251217794062/en/HEN-Technologies-Secures-%2422M-to-Build-the-Industrys-First-Operating-System-for-Fire-Defense\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Last month</a>, HEN closed a $20 million Series A round, plus $2 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. O’Neil Strategic Capital led the financing, with NSFO, Tanas Capital, and z21 Ventures participating. The round brought the company’s total funding to more than $30 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sethi, meanwhile, is already looking ahead. He says the company will return to fundraising in the second quarter of this year. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp;, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/humans-a-human-centric-ai-startup-founded-by-anthropic-xai-google-alums-raised-480m-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a $480 million seed round</a> to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI for empowering humans</a>” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of humans&amp;’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp;’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans&amp; still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/slackbot-is-an-ai-agent-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slack</a>) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of humans&amp; and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that humans&amp; doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said humans&amp; is designing the product in conjunction with the model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What is clear, though, is that humans&amp; isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$43 million round</a> at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman <a href=\"https://x.com/reidhoffman/status/2014028797507449206?s=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote on social media</a>. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the space where humans&amp; wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a humans&amp; co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent academic work</a> as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans&amp; will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The top risk, though, is that humans&amp; isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives humans&amp; a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&amp;A is certainly a risk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp; told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This post was originally published on January 22, 2026.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
