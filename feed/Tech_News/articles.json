A relatively unknown startup, Symbolic.ai, wants to change that, and it just <a href=\"https://symbolic.ai/news/symbolic.ai-partners-with-news-corp-to-deploy-ai-publishing-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed a major deal</a> with News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News Corp, the major assets of which include MarketWatch, the New York Post, and The Wall Street Journal, is set to begin using Symbolic’s AI platform with its financial news hub Dow Jones Newswires.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Symbolic.ai, which was founded by former eBay CEO Devin Wenig and Ars Technica co-founder Jon Stokes, says its AI platform can “assist in the production of quality journalism and content” and that its tool has even led to “productivity gains of as much as 90% for complex research tasks.” The platform is designed to make editorial workflows more efficient, providing improvements in areas like newsletter creation, audio transcription, fact-checking, “headline optimization,” SEO advice, and others.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In general, News Corp has shown a willingness to integrate AI into its media operations. In 2024, the company signed <a href=\"https://investors.newscorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/news-corp-and-openai-sign-landmark-multi-year-global-partnership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a multi-year partnership</a> with OpenAI, wherein it would license its material to the AI company.

These investments will span across semiconductors, energy, and AI “production and innovation,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-restoring-american-semiconductor-manufacturing-leadership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>.

The time period of these investments is unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In return, the U.S. will invest in Taiwan’s semiconductor, defense, AI, telecommunications, and biotech industries. The press release did not specify a dollar amount tied to the U.S.’s side of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes the day after the Trump administration published a proclamation that reiterated the country’s goal to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States and acknowledged the process would take time, as only 10% of semiconductors are produced stateside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. “Given the foundational role that semiconductors play in the modern economy and national defense, a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the United States’ industrial and military capabilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proclamation, which announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/the-us-imposes-25-tariff-on-nvidias-h200-ai-chips-headed-to-china/\">25% of tariffs on some advanced AI chips</a>, also stated that once trade talks with other countries — like this deal with Taiwan — are complete, there would be additional semiconductor tariffs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The company says it has now hit a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Higgsfield offers a tool that allows consumers, creators, and social media teams to create and edit AI-generated videos. The company was founded by Alex Mashrabov, former head of Generative AI at Snap, who landed at the company after it bought his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/snapchat-quietly-acquired-ai-factory-the-company-behind-its-new-cameos-feature-for-166m/\">previous startup, AI Factory,</a> in 2020 for $166 million. Mashrabov was a co-founder of AI Factory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Five months after Higgsfield launched its tool, it touted 11 million users and said it was a platform of choice for content creators. Nine months in, it has now reached over 15 million users and is on a $200 million annual revenue run rate, with that figure doubling from a $100 million trajectory in about two months, it says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup believes this puts it in rarified growth terrain, outpacing companies like Lovable, Cursor, OpenAI, Slack, and Zoom, according to its <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/higgsfield-announces-130m-series-a-and-reports-200m-annual-run-rate-302661805.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To position itself less as an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/microsofts-nadella-wants-us-to-stop-thinking-of-ai-as-slop/\">AI slop</a> maker and more as a business tool, Higgsfield now emphasizes that the product is primarily used by professional social media marketers, “a major sign that the platform adoption has evolved beyond casual content creation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, it’s still an AI slop engine as well. Last month, Higgsfield was used to create a video called “Island Holiday” that depicted people mentioned in the Epstein files alongside fictional characters on “vacation” on Epstein’s island. (Because of its offensive nature, we’re not going to link to the viral X post.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, its users also share plenty of projects centered on fashion and Hollywood-esque story telling, as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors in the Series A extension include Accel, AI Capital Partners, Menlo Ventures, and GFT Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The previous longest shutdowns in the country lasted around 163 hours in 2019, and 160 hours in 2025, according to Isik Mater, the director of research at NetBlocks, a web monitoring company that tracks internet disruptions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mater said that the current shutdown in Iran is the third longest on record, after the internet shutdown in Sudan in mid-2021 that lasted around 35 days, followed by the outage in Mauritania in July 2024, which lasted 22 days. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Iran’s shutdowns remain among the most comprehensive and tightly enforced nationwide blackouts we’ve observed, particularly in terms of population affected,” Mater told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exact ranking depends on how each organization measures a shutdown. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zach Rosson, a researcher who studies internet disruptions at the digital rights nonprofit Access Now, told TechCrunch that according to its data, the ongoing shutdown in Iran is on a path to crack <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZoKkFiaRVocWJm_Kb7Jd8jE2fsFWr_7HJo1VJlzmuw/edit?gid=0#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the top 10 longest shutdowns in history</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iran’s government has a long track record of shutting down access to the internet at times of protest and civil unrest, often making it more difficult to monitor the protests from outside of the country. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A U.S.-based human rights group <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-nuclear-us-what-to-know-explainer-845b3ac10c37727add7118ec9c2f6e46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">estimates</a> that there have been more than 600 protests in cities across Iran, and according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/iran-protests-updates-1-13-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one estimate</a>, the Iranian government’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/world/middleeast/iran-protester-deaths.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">violent crackdown</a> has led to the deaths of at least 2,000 people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/?p=3081251\">shutdown in Iran on January 8</a> was sudden, cutting government institutions like the foreign ministry from the internet.

The tariff only applies to certain semiconductors, including the Nvidia H200 advanced AI chips set to ship to China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-on-certain-advanced-computing-chips-to-protect-americas-economic-and-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed a proclamation</a> on Wednesday that entailed a 25% tariff on advanced AI semiconductors that have been produced outside the U.S. and then pass through the U.S. before being exported to customers in other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This news formalizes a key component of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision to give Nvidia the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/department-of-commerce-may-approve-nvidia-h200-chip-exports-to-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">green light to start shipping its H200 advanced AI chips</a> to vetted customers in China in December. It also includes chips from other companies, including the AMD MI325X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In spite of the tariffs, Nvidia publicly cheered the move, which allows it to sell the chip to approved customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high-paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson emailed TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/nvidia-is-reportedly-weighs-ramping-up-h200-production-to-meet-surging-demand-in-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">demand for these H200 semiconductors</a>. Nvidia was reportedly considering ramping up production on these chips due to a rush of early orders from Chinese companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Demand is just one factor, though.

A source familiar with the matter confirmed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/sam-altman-openai-will-reportedly-back-a-startup-that-takes-on-musks-neuralink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">previous reports</a> that OpenAI wrote the largest single check in Merge Labs’ $250 million seed round at an $850 million valuation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our individual experience of the world arises from billions of active neurons,” reads a statement from Merge Labs. “If we can interface with these neurons at scale, we could restore lost abilities, support healthier brain states, deepen our connection with each other, and expand what we can imagine and create alongside advanced AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merge Labs said it intends to reach these feats noninvasively by developing “entirely new technologies that connect with neurons using molecules instead of electrodes” to “transit and receive information using deep-reaching modalities like ultrasound.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move deepens <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Altman’s competition with Elon Musk,</a> whose startup Neuralink is also developing computer interface chips that allow people who suffer from severe paralysis to control devices with their thoughts. Neuralink currently requires invasive surgery for implantation, where a surgical robot removes a small piece of skull and inserts ultra-fine electrode threads into the brain to read neural signals. The company last raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/02/elon-musks-neuralink-closes-a-650m-series-e/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$650 million</a> Series E at a $9 billion valuation in June 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there are undoubtedly medical use cases for BCIs, Merge Labs seems more focused on using the technology to fulfill a Silicon Valley fantasy of combining human biology with AI to give us superhuman capabilities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are an important new frontier,” OpenAI wrote in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/investing-in-merge-labs/\">blog post</a>. “They open new ways to communicate, learn, and interact with technology. BCIs will create a natural, human-centered way for anyone to seamlessly interact with AI. This is why OpenAI is participating in Merge Labs’ seed round.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from Altman, other co-founders include Alex Blania (CEO) and Sandro Herbig (product and engineering lead) at Tools for Humanity, another Altman-backed company (and creator of the eye-scanning World orbs); Tyson Aflalo and Sumner Norman, co-founders of implantable neural tech company Forest Neurotech; and Mikhail Shapiro, a researcher at Caltech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blania and <a href=\"https://x.com/sandroherbig/status/2011827239726498299\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Herbig</a> said in separate <a href=\"https://x.com/alexblania/status/2011830523619131851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">social media posts</a> that they would continue their roles at Tools for Humanity. Merge Labs did not confirm whether Alfalo and Norman would maintain their positions at Forest Neurotech, only saying that the company would continue operating and will have a “wonderful working relationship” with Merge. Shapiro intends to continue teaching at Caltech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson told TechCrunch that the co-founders are also Merge Labs’ board members.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, OpenAI will work with Merge Labs on scientific foundation models and other frontier tools to “accelerate progress.” In its blog post, OpenAI noted that AI will not only help accelerate R&amp;D in bioengineering, neuroscience, and device engineering, but that the interfaces will also benefit from AI operating systems that “can interpret intent, adapt to individuals, and operate reliably with limited and noisy signals.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, Merge Labs could function as a remote control for OpenAI’s software. That leads into the circular nature of the deal: If Merge Labs succeeds, it could drive more users to OpenAI, which then justifies OpenAI’s investment into the company. It also increases the value of a startup Altman owns using resources from a company he runs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is also working with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/05/openai-and-jony-ive-may-be-struggling-to-figure-out-their-ai-device/\">Jony Ive’s startup io</a>, which it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired</a> last year, to produce a piece of AI hardware that doesn’t rely on a screen. Recent <a href=\"https://x.com/koltregaskes/status/2011339755246731574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unconfirmed leaks</a> suggest the device might be an earbud. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI primarily invests through the OpenAI Startup Fund, which has invested in several other startups connected to Altman, including Red Queen Bio, Rain AI, and Harvey. OpenAI has also entered into commercial agreements with startups Altman personally owns or chairs, including nuclear fusion startup Helion Energy and nuclear fission company Oklo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman has been dreaming about the “merge” — the idea that humans and machines will merge — since at least 2017 when he published a <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> guessing it would happen somewhere between 2025 and 2075. He also speculated that the merge could take many forms, including plugging electrons into our brains or becoming “really close friends with a chatbot.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said a merge is our “best-case scenario” for humanity surviving against superintelligence AI, which he describes as a separate species that’s in conflict with humans. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder,” Altman wrote. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI and Merge Labs for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to confirm that Merge Labs’ founders will continue work at their respective companies. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Absent any changes, the world could face a severe shortfall <a href=\"https://press.spglobal.com/2026-01-08-Substantial-Shortfall-in-Copper-Supply-Widens-as-the-Race-for-AI-and-Growing-Defense-Spending-Add-to-Accelerating-Demand,-New-S-P-Global-Study-Finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as early as 2040</a>, with demand exceeding supply by as much as 25%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If copper seems expensive today, just wait a few years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies and investors have been pouring money into the sector as demand ramps up. AI minerals startup KoBold, for example, raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/02/kobold-used-ai-to-find-copper-now-investors-are-piling-in-to-the-tune-of-537m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$537 million last year</a> to exploit a copper deposit it found in Zambia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with a little help from some microbes, today’s copper producers might be able to beat the shortage. One startup, <a href=\"https://transitionmetal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Transition Metal Solutions</a>, says it has found a way to boost copper production by 20% to 30% using additives to boost the microbes’ performance. Think of it as prebiotics for copper mines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To scale up its technology, Transition Metal Solutions has raised a $6 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Transition Ventures with participation from Astor Management AG, Climate Capital, Dolby Family Ventures, Essential Capital, Juniper VC, Kayak Ventures, New Climate Ventures, Possible Ventures, SOSV, and Understorey Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microbes have always been key players in the copper world, helping the metal break out of its mineral form so that we can refine it into pure metal. Companies have been working for years to coax microbes into squeezing more copper out of ore, but according to Sasha Milshteyn, co-founder and CEO of Transition, they’ve been going about it the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Typically, companies isolate or engineer strains that show promise in boosting copper production. They grow large quantities of them and pour them over an ore heap, where the microbes soak in and get to work.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That by and large hasn’t paid off,” Milshteyn told TechCrunch. “Often they will see kind of a boost early on and then it just kind of falls off — or they don’t see any boost at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Milshteyn suspects that part of the problem is that microbes aren’t solo actors. It’s like casting a star without a supporting cast. Microbes live in diverse communities where each plays a role. Bumping up the population of one strain can only do so much.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another part of the problem is that we’ve only scratched the surface on understanding microbes in ore heaps. “When you look into the microbial community that’s present in the material, typically well over 90% of it are things that we’ve never seen before,” Milshteyn said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conditions inside a heap leach, as the acid-laced piles of ore are called, are challenging to replicate in a lab. The pH is low, around 2, and there are clays and other metals floating around, all of which undermine the usual molecular tools scientists use to understand microbial communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everything that the industry has done has really focused on that tiny fraction that people have been able to grow in the lab,” he said. “Typically, it’s in the 5% range that you can culture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So instead of trying to isolate a few star performers, Transition is working to raise the entire community up. The company applies low-cost, mostly inorganic compounds that are already found at mining sites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’re focused on is not necessarily boosting one or two species, but we’re trying to nudge the community towards the higher functional state,” he said. “We’ve observed that in the lab.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In lab samples that Transition has applied its proprietary cocktail to, the startup has been able to extract 90% of the copper from the ore, up from 60% using traditional methods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of the lab, Milshteyn expects the efficacy to drop a bit, though not by much. Traditional heap leaches extract around 30% to 60% of the copper in the ore. He thinks Transition can bring that up to at least 50% to 70%, maybe higher. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each mine has a different microbial community, so Transition plans to tailor its additives based on initial testing. As the company gathers more data, Milshteyn thinks that eventually he and his team will be able to predict what a mine needs in advance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that rate, the company’s prebiotics could solve the copper shortage before it starts. But first, Transition has to show the mining industry that its solution works. The company plans to work with a third-party metallurgy lab that’s known within the mining world. “Without third party results, nobody’s going to believe you,” Milshteyn said. Money from the seed round should cover that phase of testing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Transition has proven it works in the lab, then it’ll apply its treatment to a demonstration heap containing tens of thousands of tons of material. With luck, it’ll then deploy its technology at copper mines around the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re leaving 65% of material behind” at typical mines, Milshteyn said. “We may as well get as much out of it as we can.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: The article previously referred to Transition’s additives as probiotics instead of prebiotics.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While not all AI-based image generation and editing services let users “undress” people, they do let one easily generate deepfakes. To pick a few examples, OpenAI’s Sora 2 reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-using-sora-2-to-make-child-fetish-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">allowed users to generate explicit videos</a> featuring children; Google’s Nano Banana seemingly <a href=\"https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/charlie-kirks-nano-banana-figurine-sparks-backlash-x-account-suspended-as-public-calls-for-fbi-intervention/articleshow/124044298.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">generated</a> an image showing Charlie Kirk being shot; and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/697188/racist-ai-generated-videos-google-veo-3-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">racist videos</a> made with Google’s AI video model are garnering millions of views on social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue grows even more complex when Chinese image and video generators come into the picture. Many Chinese tech companies and apps — especially those linked to ByteDance — offer easy ways to edit faces, voices, and videos, and those outputs have spread to Western social platforms. China has stronger synthetic content labeling requirements that don’t exist in the U.S. on the federal level, where the masses instead rely on fragmented and dubiously enforced policies from the platforms themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. lawmakers have already passed some legislation seeking to rein in deepfake pornography, but the impact has been limited. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Take It Down Act</a>, which became federal law in May, is meant to criminalize the creation and dissemination of nonconsensual, sexualized imagery. But <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/a-new-jersey-lawsuit-shows-how-hard-it-is-to-fight-deepfake-porn/\">a number of provisions in the law</a> make it difficult to hold image-generating platforms accountable, as they focus most of the scrutiny on individual users instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, a number of states are trying to take matters into their own hands to protect consumers and elections. This week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-proposals-protect-consumers-and-workers\">New York governor </a><a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-proposals-protect-consumers-and-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kathy Hochul</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-proposals-protect-consumers-and-workers\"> proposed laws</a> that would require AI-generated content to be labeled as such, and ban nonconsensual deepfakes in specified periods leading up to elections, including depictions of opposition candidates.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The decision set aside a 2024 Delhi High Court ruling that had overturned a 2020 order by the Authority for Advance Ruling, which had found the firm was, prima facie, avoiding tax and therefore not eligible for treaty relief.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ruling is being closely watched by investors, as it strengthens India’s hand in challenging offshore “treaty-routing” structures that have long been used to reduce tax on high-value exits. It could also raise uncertainty over how future cross-border deals are structured and priced, at a time when foreign funds are counting on India as a key growth market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its verdict, a two-judge bench <a href=\"https://www.sci.gov.in/view-pdf/?diary_no=12512025&amp;type=j&amp;order_date=2026-01-15&amp;from=latest_judgements_order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> (PDF) that when a transaction appears, at first glance, to be designed to avoid income tax, India’s advance-ruling mechanism cannot be used to seek protection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tiger Global first invested in India’s e-commerce firm Flipkart in 2009 with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/tiger-global-management-is-killing-it-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an initial $9 million investment</a>, before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/30/walmart-flipkart-tiger-global/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increasing its exposure to about $1.2 billion</a> over multiple funding rounds, TechCrunch had reported earlier. The firm later sold its stake to Walmart <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/secondary-venture-sales-tiger-flipkart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for about $1.4 billion in 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tax dispute centers on how Tiger Global structured that investment — through entities in Mauritius — and whether those vehicles could claim protection under the India–Mauritius tax treaty to shield capital gains from Indian tax.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While selling Flipkart’s stake during Walmart’s $16 billion deal, Tiger Global sought a certificate allowing no tax to be withheld, arguing that because the shares were acquired before April 1, 2017, the gains were exempt from Indian capital gains tax under a “grandfathering” clause, protecting older investments from the newer tax regime, in the India–Mauritius double taxation avoidance agreement. Indian tax authorities rejected the request in 2020, questioning the offshore structure chosen by the investment firm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Supreme Court bench framed the dispute as an issue of sovereign taxing powers, warning against structures that are designed primarily to dilute that authority.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Taxing an income arising out of its own country is an inherent sovereign right of that country,” the bench said, adding that “any dilution of this power through artificial arrangements is a direct threat to its sovereignty and long-term national interest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The judgment should be read as a caution against aggressive tax planning rather than a wholesale dismantling of the India–Mauritius treaty framework, Ajay Rotti, a tax expert and founder and CEO of tax advisory firm Tax Compass, <a href=\"https://x.com/ajayrotti/status/2011757329788923988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> on X. He said the decision reinforces a broader shift toward “substance over form,” signaling treaty protection may not apply automatically where offshore entities lack real commercial activity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tiger Global did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm can seek a review of the verdict, though such petitions are rarely successful.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup is developing a launch vehicle designed to be fully reusable and is readying engine hot-fire tests ahead of its first technology demonstration flight, planned for 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based company confirms that it closed an oversubscribed $20.5 million Series A round led by TDK Ventures and BIG Capital, as TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/tdk-ventures-accel-set-to-back-indias-etherealx-in-reusable-launch-vehicle-push-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported</a> earlier. Accel, Prosus, YourNest, BlueHill, Campus Fund, and Riceberg Ventures also participated, EtherealX said. The raise follows a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/indias-etherealx-puts-5m-seed-toward-fully-reusable-launch-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$5 million seed round</a> in August 2024 that valued the startup at $14.6 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As India pushes to mature its space ecosystem beyond small launchers and component contracts — targeting growth in its space economy to <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/india-targets-45-billion-space-economy-driven-by-private-firms/articleshow/125830683.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$45 billion from $8 billion</a> over the next decade — EtherealX is among the  startups drawing attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Satellite operators worldwide are looking for more launch capacity and scheduling flexibility in a market where SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has set the benchmark for pricing and cadence. EtherealX is aiming for that space with its fully reusable vehicle designed to return both the booster and upper stage. That’s an approach that, if proven, could cut per-launch costs and increase flight frequency without relying on a native constellation to keep rockets fully booked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EtherealX is developing two engines in-house: the 80-kilonewton “Pegasus” upper-stage engine and the 1.2-meganewton “Stallion” booster engine, with hot-fire tests targeted for June–July. Thrust, measured in kilonewtons and meganewtons, indicates how much lifting force an engine can generate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is targeting a November–December 2027 launch window for a technology demonstration vehicle, ahead of commercial missions expected to begin toward the end of 2028, co-founder and CEO Manu J. Nair said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket engineers also track specific impulse, a widely used proxy for fuel efficiency, which — along with thrust — helps determine how much payload a vehicle can carry for a given amount of propellant.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pegasus engine produces 323 seconds of vacuum-specific impulse and uses what the startup describes as a proprietary “full-flow segregated cooling cycle.” The engine integrates an in-house additively manufactured turbopump. Furthermore, the Stallion booster engine uses a gas-generator cycle and delivers 306 seconds of sea-level specific impulse.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082877\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=768,600 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=680,531 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=1200,938 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=1280,1000 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=430,336 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=720,563 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=900,703 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=800,625 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=1536,1200 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=668,522 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=480,375 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=790,617 790w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ethrealx-turbopump.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">EtherealX’s additively manufactured turbopump assembly designed for the upper-stage engine.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>EtherealX</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nair told TechCrunch that EtherealX plans to cluster multiple engines per stage for its main medium-lift vehicle, called Razor Crest Mk-1, with nine Stallion engines on the booster and 15 Pegasus engines on the upper stage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 primarily reuses its first-stage booster while expending the upper stage. EtherealX is targeting deeper reusability by designing its vehicle to return both the booster and the upper stage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EtherealX’s vehicle aims to carry up to 24.8 tons in an expendable configuration, 22.8 tons partially reusable, and about 8 tons when fully reusable. The startup is targeting pricing of $350 to $2,000 per kilogram over time, Nair said, depending on configuration and cadence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To support development, EtherealX operates a rocket engine test site in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, known as Base 001, which Nair said is focused on upper-stage engine qualification. The startup has also secured a 150-acre manufacturing and testing campus in Andhra Pradesh’s proposed space city that it expects to become operational from mid-2026 for integrated engine and stage testing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EtherealX has signed launch memoranda of understanding totaling around $130 million with customers, including Japan’s Space BD and Taiwan’s space agency, TASA, Nair said, as it seeks early commercial demand ahead of its first demonstration flight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest funding will be used to complete flight qualification of the Stallion booster engine and to run clustered-firing tests of the Pegasus upper-stage engines, Nair said. To support that ramp-up, the startup currently employs 67 people and expects to grow to about 90 over the next two months as it increases manufacturing capacity and moves to a higher testing cadence ahead of its first demonstration flight.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It will initially focus on the western Indian state of Maharashtra and involve around 40,000-45,000 smallholder farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agreement comes as large corporations, including Microsoft, ramp up spending on carbon removal — projects designed to physically remove carbon dioxide from the air. The Redmond-based software maker is working toward its goal of becoming <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">carbon-negative by 2030</a>. However, Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/29/environmental-sustainability-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">total greenhouse gas emissions rose 23.4%</a> in fiscal year 2024 from a 2020 baseline, primarily driven by value-chain emissions linked to its growing cloud and AI business. Microsoft has not yet reported on its carbon progress for 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the rapid expansion of AI operations, energy use and emissions are rising, pushing companies to look beyond the U.S. for carbon removal projects that can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. India has increasingly emerged as an attractive market for such projects because of its large volumes of agricultural waste and the scale of its farming economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha will develop 18 industrial reactors that will operate for 15 years, with a total projected removal volume exceeding 2 million tons of carbon dioxide over the project’s lifetime, the companies said in a statement on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the biggest gaps in carbon removal markets is not just installing equipment to produce biochar, but running projects reliably and navigating a stringent process to issue credits. Varaha’s ability to deliver credits at scale helped it emerge as the world’s second-largest player in durable carbon deliveries and drew Microsoft’s attention, co-founder and CEO Madhur Jain said in an interview.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082744\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/farmers-spreading-biochar-farms.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A Farmer spreading Biochar at their farm to enhance soil quality</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Varaha</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s requirements for digital monitoring, reporting, and verification meant Varaha had to build bespoke systems in-house, Jain told TechCrunch, adding that working with tens of thousands of smallholder farmers in India makes tracking and logistics far more complex than biochar projects in the U.S. or Europe that rely on biomass concentrated at a single industrial site.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More than 30% of our team has worked in agriculture,” Jain said, adding that the experience has helped Varaha design systems that work on the ground with farmers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The project’s first reactor will be located next to Varaha’s 52-acre cotton research farm in Maharashtra, where the startup works with farmers to test practices such as applying biochar to soil under real-world conditions. The startup plans to scale up to 18 reactors across India’s cotton-growing belt under Microsoft’s commitment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varaha has rapidly scaled its biochar operations over the past year, Jain said. In 2025, it processed about 240,000 tons of biomass, producing roughly 55,000-56,000 tons of biochar and generating around 115,000 credits, up from around 15,000-18,000 a year earlier, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup expects volumes to rise further as new contracts kick in, with Jain saying it aims to at least double its 2025 throughput in 2026 to around half a million tons of biomass and close to 250,000 tons of carbon sequestered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Varaha has 20 projects in total across India, Nepal, and Bangladesh — 14 in advanced stages and another six in early stages — spanning regenerative agriculture, biochar, agroforestry, and enhanced rock weathering and works with around 150,000 farmers. These projects have the potential to sequester about 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide over lifetimes ranging from 15 to 40 years, Jain said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082746\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasifier-converting-biomass-to-biochar.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A Gassifer to convert biomass into biochar</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Varaha</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond carbon credits, the latest project aims to reduce open burning of cotton stalks, which contributes to seasonal air pollution in parts of India, while returning biochar to farms to improve soil health and reduce dependence on chemical fertilizers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This offtake agreement broadens the diversity of Microsoft’s carbon removal portfolio with Varaha’s biochar project design that is both scalable and durable,” said Phil Goodman, Microsoft’s CDR program director, in a prepared statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Varaha deal highlights Microsoft’s push to diversify its carbon removal portfolio, the volumes remain small compared with its overall footprint, as the software giant <a href=\"https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/msc/documents/presentations/CSR/2025-Microsoft-Environmental-Data-Fact-Sheet-PDF.pdf#page=01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> (PDF) total greenhouse gas emissions of 15.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in FY2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft contracted for <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about 22 million metric tons of carbon removals</a> in FY2024 as part of its carbon-negative strategy.

Another former OpenAI staffer who went to work for Murati’s startup is also headed back to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On social media on Wednesday, Murati announced the departure of Barret Zoph, the company’s co-founder and CTO. “We have parted ways with Barret Zoph,” Murati said <a href=\"https://x.com/miramurati/status/2011577319295692801?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on X</a>. “Soumith Chintala will be the new CTO of Thinking Machines. He is a brilliant and seasoned leader who has made important contributions to the AI field for over a decade, and he’s been a major contributor to our team. We could not be more excited to have him take on this new responsibility.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murati’s announcement made no mention of other departures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just 58 minutes after Murati’s announcement of Zoph’s departure, Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, announced that Zoph would be headed back to OpenAI. “Excited to welcome Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, and Sam Schoenholz back to OpenAI! This has been in the works for several weeks, and we’re thrilled to have them join the team,” <a href=\"https://x.com/fidjissimo/status/2011592010881446116?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Simo wrote on X</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Metz <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lsvp.com/company/thinking-machines/\">is another co-founder</a> of Thinking Machines and previously <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-metz-5003046a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">worked for OpenAI</a> for a number of years on the company’s technical staff. So did Schoenholz, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-schoenholz-379830a0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">whose LinkedIn profile</a> still lists him as working for Thinking Machines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoph previously worked for OpenAI as VP of research, and before that, worked for six years at Google as a research scientist. Murati, who served as the CTO of OpenAI until September 2024, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/technology/mira-murati-openai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">left the company</a> and co-founded Thinking Machines with Zoph and Metz. The startup, where Murati serves as CEO, has amassed significant financial support since then, closing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\">a $2 billion seed round</a> last July, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, which led the round, as well as Accel, Nvidia, AMD, and Jane Street, among others. The round valued the company at $12 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to both Thinking Machines and OpenAI for comment. Wired reports that the split between Zoph and Thinking Labs <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/thinking-machines-lab-cofounders-leave-for-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wasn’t amicable</a>. Certainly, it’s telling that Murati didn’t write more in her public messaging about his departure from the company.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While talent moves between AI giants are common in Silicon Valley, the departure of co-founders from a startup less than a year after its founding is particularly notable. The loss of two co-founders simultaneously — especially when one served as CTO — could be perceived as a particularly meaningful setback for Thinking Machines, which had assembled a high-profile team of former OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral AI researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also lost other key personnel, including co-founder Andrew Tulloch, who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/11/thinking-machines-lab-co-founder-andrew-tulloch-heads-to-meta/\">left to join Meta</a> in October. OpenAI itself has seen numerous co-founders depart to launch or join competing ventures, including John Schulman, who left for Anthropic in August 2024 before joining Thinking Machines as chief scientist at its launch in February of last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The finalized order, which comes a year after the agency reached a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/gm-banned-from-sharing-driving-and-location-data-with-insurance-companies/\">proposed settlement</a> with GM, also requires the automaker to be more transparent with its consumers and obtain their explicit consent on certain data collection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/GMAdminOrderDec2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">finalized order</a> comes nearly two years after a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">New York Times report </a>showed how GM and OnStar collected, used, and sold drivers’ precise geolocation data and driving behavior to third parties, including data brokers LexisNexis and Verisk. The data was collected through GM’s Smart Driver program, a free feature contained within its connected car apps that tracked and rated driving behaviors and seatbelt use. Data brokers sold this information to insurance providers, which could affect customers’ rates, the NYT reported at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM <a href=\"https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2024/apr/0424-driver.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discontinued</a> the Smart Driver program in April 2024 across all of its brands, citing customer feedback. GM said at the time it unenrolled all customers and ended its third-party telematics relationships with LexisNexis and Verisk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FTC alleged that GM and OnStar used a misleading enrollment process to get consumers to sign up for its OnStar connected vehicle service and OnStar Smart Driver feature. The FTC also alleged the automaker failed to clearly disclose that the data would be collected and sold to third parties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the order finalized Wednesday, GM is also required to obtain explicit consent from consumers prior to collecting, using, or sharing connected vehicle data. This process occurs at the dealership when a consumer buys a car from a GM brand. At that point, the OnStar system is linked to that particular vehicle VIN number and the new owner is asked whether they agree or not with data collection, according to GM.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some exceptions to the data collection ban, however. GM is allowed to share location data with emergency first responders and for internal research, the FTC said. GM confirmed this, noting it collects data for internal research and development and sometimes shares de-identified, or anonymized data (not associated with specific drivers or vehicles) with select partners to enhance city infrastructure and improve road safety. For instance, data has been shared with the University of Michigan, which used it for <a href=\"https://www.umtri.umich.edu/2025/11/05/new-traffic-signal-reduces-unnecessary-stops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">urban planning. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM must also establish a way for all U.S. consumers to request a copy of their data and seek its deletion and give them the ability to disable the collection of precise geolocation data from their vehicles. GM says it has already complied with these mandates.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM says it began overhauling its policies and programs on data collection and privacy in 2024. For instance, the automaker said it has consolidated many of its U.S. privacy statements into a single, simpler statement and expanded its privacy program that allows customers to access and delete their personal information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Federal Trade Commission has formally approved the agreement reached last year with General Motors to address concerns,” an emailed statement from GM reads. “As vehicle connectivity becomes increasingly integral to the driving experience, GM remains committed to protecting customer privacy, maintaining trust, and ensuring customers have a clear understanding of our practices.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: The previous article incorrectly stated GM would be required to obtain their explicit consent on any data collection.

The funding values Emversity at around $120 million post-money, sources confirmed to TechCrunch, up from about $60 million in its April 2025 pre-Series A round. Total funding now stands at $46 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has been grappling with a widening skills gap, with graduates often entering the workforce without job-ready skills even as key service sectors struggle to hire trained staff. In healthcare, the Indian government says the country has <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2197614\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about 4.3 million registered nursing personnel</a> and 5,253 nursing institutions producing roughly 387,000 nurses annually, yet recent reports have <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/indias-home-nurses-are-overworked-untrained-and-undervalued-how-to-bridge-the-gap-in-elderly-care/articleshow/120876242.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">continued to flag a shortage</a>. Hospitality, too, has faced a <a href=\"https://etedge-insights.com/industry/travel-and-leisure/hospitalitys-great-talent-gap-why-the-luxury-industry-must-rethink-attraction-retention/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">55% to 60% demand-supply gap</a> for workers, according to industry estimates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity is trying to bridge that gap by integrating employer-designed training programs into university curricula and running skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and placements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two-year-old startup has partnered with 23 universities and colleges across over 40 campuses and focuses on “grey-collar” roles — positions that require hands-on training and credentialing — including nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, as well as hospitality roles such as guest relations and food and beverage service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity has trained about 4,500 learners so far and placed 800 candidates to date, founder and CEO Vivek Sinha (pictured above) said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sinha, who previously served as chief operating officer at Indian edtech startup Unacademy for over three years before starting Emversity in 2023, told TechCrunch he conceived the idea while working on test-preparation courses for entry-level government jobs. He noticed that applicants included engineers, MBAs, and even PhDs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I started speaking to these learners,” he said. “Some of them had paid fees to private colleges and spent 16 to 18 years earning those degrees.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sinha said the gap has widened in recent years and could grow further as automation and new workplace tools change what employers expect from entry-level hires, while demand remains strong in credentialed roles such as healthcare, where hands-on training and staffing ratios still matter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI can cut down the administrative work of a nurse, such as filing patient details or electronic medical records,” Sinha stated. “But AI can’t replace a nurse if you still need one at an ICU for every two beds.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity works with employers such as Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels), and Lemon Tree Hotels to co-design role-specific training modules, which it then helps universities embed into their degree programs. The startup does not charge employers, instead earning revenue through fees paid by partner institutions and through short-term certification programs run at its NSDC-affiliated skill centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup operates with gross margins of about 80% and has kept customer acquisition costs below 10% of revenue by relying largely on organic channels rather than performance marketing, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the startup offers a career counseling platform for high school students that generated more than 350,000 inquiries and accounted for more than 20% of revenue last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the fresh funding, Emversity plans to expand its footprint to more than 200 locations over the next two years and deepen its focus on healthcare and hospitality, while entering new industries such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and manufacturing. The startup is already in advanced discussions with one of India’s top EPC companies to design and roll out role-specific programs this year, and plans to begin manufacturing-focused training next year, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To deliver consistent outcomes across campuses, Emversity combines employer-led curriculum design with hands-on training infrastructure, including simulation labs for clinical roles such as nursing and emergency care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Emversity’s revenue split roughly evenly between its university-embedded training programs and short-term certification courses run through its own skill centers, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Emversity currently builds talent pipelines for domestic employers, Sinha said the startup sees an opportunity to eventually serve international demand as well, particularly in healthcare, as aging populations in markets such as Japan and Germany look for trained workers. However, he did not disclose the exact timeline for catering to global demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity has about 700 employees, including 200 to 250 trainers deployed across its campus network.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Copyleaks, an AI detection and content governance platform, estimated roughly one image was posted each minute on X. A separate <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2Nzc5MDk4NywiZXhwIjoxNzY4Mzk1Nzg3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOEhRS0hLR0lGUE8wMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.3B4JWnmqmXFC3DOqhs11h99g5gNzi4j_poKAHLuWdrY&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sample</a> gathered from January 5 to January 6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. (X and xAI are part of the same company.) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This material…has been used to harass people across the internet,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement. “I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AG’s office will investigate whether and how xAI violated the law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several laws exist to protect targets of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\">Take It Down Act</a> was signed into a federal law, which criminalizes knowingly distributing nonconsensual intimate images — including deepfakes — and requires platforms like X to remove such content within 48 hours. California also has its own <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/19/governor-newsom-signs-bills-to-crack-down-on-sexually-explicit-deepfakes-require-ai-watermarking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">series of laws</a> that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2024 to crack down on sexually explicit deepfakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grok began fulfilling user requests on X to produce sexualized photos of women and children toward the end of the year. The trend appears to have taken off after certain adult-content creators prompted Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves as a form of marketing, which then led to other users issuing similar prompts. In a number of public cases, including well-known figures like “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown, Grok responded to prompts asking it to alter real photos of real women by changing clothing, body positioning, or physical features in overtly sexual ways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/13/musks-x-stops-bikini-bot-undressing-women/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some reports</a>, xAI has begun implementing safeguards to address the issue. Grok now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/x-restricts-groks-image-generation-to-paying-subscribers-only-after-drawing-the-worlds-ire/\">requires a premium subscription</a> before responding to certain image-generation requests, and even then the image may not be generated. April Kozen, VP of marketing at Copyleaks, told TechCrunch that Grok may fulfill a request in a more generic or toned-down way. They added that Grok appears more permissive with adult content creators. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, these behaviors suggest X is experimenting with multiple mechanisms to reduce or control problematic image generation, though inconsistencies remain,” Kozen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neither xAI nor Musk has publicly addressed the problem head on. A few days after the instances began, Musk appeared to make light of the issue by asking Grok to generate an <a href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/2006546133875876195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2006547579161686289%7Ctwgr%5Ecd342afac0c746785e362fda4ec482da7d71b4d4%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mandatory.com%2Fnews%2F1708977-elon-musk-bikini-grok-ai-image\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">image of himself in a bikini</a>. On January 3, <a href=\"https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">X’s safety account</a> said the company takes “action against illegal content on X, including [CSAM],” without specifically addressing Grok’s apparent lack of safeguards or the creation of sexualized manipulated imagery involving women. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The positioning mirrors what Musk posted today, emphasizing illegality and user behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk wrote he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” That statement doesn’t deny the existence of bikini pics or sexualized edits more broadly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School and former litigator, told TechCrunch that Musk likely narrowly focused on CSAM because the penalties for creating or distributing synthetic sexualized imagery of children are greater. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For example, in the United States, the distributor or threatened distributor of CSAM can face up to three years imprisonment under the Take It Down Act, compared to two for nonconsensual adult sexual imagery,” Goodyear said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the “bigger point” is Musk’s attempt to draw attention to problematic user content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user request,” Musk wrote in his post. “When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taken together, the post characterizes these incidents as uncommon, attributes them to user requests or adversarial prompting, and presents them as technical issues that can be solved through fixes. It stops short of acknowledging any shortcomings in Grok’s underlying safety design. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Regulators may consider, with attention to free speech protections, requiring proactive measures by AI developers to prevent such content,” Goodyear said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI to ask how many times it caught instances of nonconsensual sexually manipulated images of women and children, what guardrails specifically changed, and whether the company notified regulators of the issue. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The California AG isn’t the only regulator to try to hold xAI accountable for the issue. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">Indonesia and Malaysia</a> have both temporarily blocked access to Grok; India has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/india-orders-musks-x-to-fix-grok-over-obscene-ai-content/\">demanded that X</a> make immediate technical and procedural changes to Grok; the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-commission-has-ordered-x-retain-all-grok-documents-until-end-2026-2026-01-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">European Commission ordered</a> xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot, a precursor to opening a new investigation; and the U.K.’s online safety watchdog <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/ofcom-launches-investigation-into-x-over-grok-sexualised-imagery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ofcom opened a formal investigation</a> under the U.K.’s Online Safety Act. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI has come under fire for Grok’s sexualized imagery before. As AG Bonta pointed out in a statement, Grok includes a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/grok-imagine-xais-new-ai-image-and-video-generator-lets-you-make-nsfw-content/\">“spicy mode”</a> to generate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/of-course-groks-ai-companions-want-to-have-sex-and-burn-down-schools/\">explicit content</a>. In October, an update made it even easier to jailbreak what little safety guidelines there were, resulting in many users creating hardcore pornography with Grok, as well as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">graphic and violent sexual images</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the more pornographic images that Grok has produced have been of AI-generated people — something that many might still find ethically dubious but perhaps less harmful to the individuals in the images and videos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people’s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,” Copyleaks co-founder and CEO Alon Yamin said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “From Sora to Grok, we are seeing a rapid rise in AI capabilities for manipulated media. To that end, detection and governance are needed now more than ever to help prevent misuse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
