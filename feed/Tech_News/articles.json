But it also doesn’t want the U.S.’s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s quite the balance to strike.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If President Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Action Plan</a>, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“​​America currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,” the plan stated. “It is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through “creative approaches” followed by a pair of policy recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn’t a focus on many of the component subsystems — a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“America must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,” the plan states. “We should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there’s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months — including just last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/nvidias-resumption-of-h20-chip-sales-related-to-rare-earth-element-trade-talks/\">the green light to start selling AI chips</a> they had developed for China, just months after rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/\">licensing restrictions on the same AI chips</a> that effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/\">AI diffusion rule</a> (which put a cap on how much AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it’s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The fee for the event is $600.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/y-combinator-cuts-nearly-20-of-staff-scales-back-growth-stage-investments/\">YC laid off most of the folks</a> putting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator’s events have always been highly popular and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/25/in-2024-it-really-is-better-to-run-a-startup-in-san-francisco-according-to-data-and-founders-whove-relocated/\">were a major force in making San Francisco the hub</a> for the burgeoning AI startup community. (Of course, the center of that universe is YC-affiliated OpenAI, also headquartered in San Francisco and run by former YC president Sam Altman.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The people putting on this event are doing it because they are appalled at how often early-stage startups are led to believe they must pay tens of thousands of dollars to hire PR and social media agencies, one person involved told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/why-a16z-vc-believes-that-cluely-the-cheat-on-everything-startup-is-the-new-blueprint-for-ai-startups/\">startups that routinely go viral, like Cluely,</a> founders feel pressured to do the same.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also true that a single social media post can make an early-stage startup go viral these days. The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and nab <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/rorks-founders-were-almost-broke-when-a-viral-tweet-led-to-2-8m-and-a16z/\">a spot in a16z’s Speedrun program</a>. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/defense-tech-theseus-landed-y-combinator-the-us-special-forces-and-4-3m-from-a-tweet/\">Defense tech startup Theseus</a> landed a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the folks behind the new event could help YC founders, they believe they can help founders who aren’t part of the famed program — and on the cheap without giving up equity. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The organization on Wednesday announced it’s launching a campaign that introduces banners inside its Android and iOS apps, prompting users to make a monetary donation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, the feature will be shown only to those on the Mastodon servers the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/mastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure/\">nonprofit</a> itself operates, Mastodon.social and Mastodon.online. These banners will be easy to dismiss, Mastodon says, and will only be shown to people who have accounts that have existed for at least four weeks. The organization promises that it won’t continually prompt users to donate, either.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such campaigns can work well for nonprofit organizations at scale. Wikimedia Foundation, for example, brings in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising/2024_banners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">majority</a> of its funding from individual donors, including those who donate through the pop-up banners that occasionally appear on Wikipedia. However, Mastodon has a much smaller user base: 8.1 million <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fedidb.com/\">r</a><a href=\"https://fedidb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">e</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fedidb.com/\">gistered</a> accounts, and fewer than 1 million monthly active users. Still, the banners could encourage people who haven’t actively sought out ways to contribute to now do so, as it makes the process more seamless as an in-app feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon says it will later expand the campaign to the web and, if successful, make it available to all other Mastodon instances. The latter would allow individual server admins to receive direct support from their own users, which could help keep them operational. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an open, decentralized social media platform, Mastodon faces challenges when it comes to financial support. Unlike Meta and X, which are supported by ads, Mastodon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/amid-twitter-chaos-mastodon-grew-donations-488-in-2022-reached-1-8m-monthly-active-users/\">so far has relied largely on</a> user donations from Patreon. It has also accepted a handful of donations from open source-focused funds and foundations over the years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/reports/Mastodon%20Annual%20Report%202023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2023</a>, Mastodon raised €545,000 in total donations, up 65% year-over-year, but its Patreon donor base dropped nearly 23% to 7,400. (Its 2024 report is not out yet.) That decline could have pushed it to look into more aggressive fundraising tactics, especially as competition from Meta and newcomers like the VC-backed startup Bluesky is growing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know that collecting money can present complexities and questions,” a Mastodon <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/07/a-nudge-to-fund-our-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> stated. “We’d like to figure out how to do this well, together with the community. This is not a corporate fundraising campaign: it’s an effort to secure the future of a more ethical and independent social web.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizes <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/openai-agreed-to-pay-oracle-30b-a-year-for-data-center-services/\">building out data centers</a> to power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration positions this as the only way to “usher in a new golden age of human flourishing.” Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,” Trump said in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a>. “To do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to ‘Build, Baby, Build!’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration’s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-deregulation-and-bringing-back-the-ai-moratorium\">Deregulation and bringing back the AI moratorium</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the start of this month, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/us-senate-removes-controversial-ai-moratorium-from-budget-bill/\">Senate removed a controversial provision</a> in the budget bill that would bar states from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/\">regulating AI for 10 years</a>. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states’ federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It appears that matter hasn’t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to “unleash prosperity through deregulation,” the administration threatens to limit states’ federal funding based on their AI regulations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to “evaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency’s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.” In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet — which many do — then the FCC can get involved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cutting-red-tape-around-data-centers\">Cutting red tape around data centers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">data centers</a>, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations — like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act — are hindering America’s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Trump’s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America’s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers — such as AI companies — can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Certain companies, like xAI and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Meta</a>, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/memphis-xai-elon-musk-pollution-naacp-571c16950259b382f9eae61bd59260ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Critics have accused xAI</a> of bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep “adversarial technology” — like Chinese-made chips and hardware — out of the U.S. supply chain. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-trump-s-war-on-biased-ai\">Trump’s war on “biased AI”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the main standouts in Trump’s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and “American values,” in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,” the plan reads. “We must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn’t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who “ensure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That language is similar to what <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> would be in Trump’s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,” Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contracts <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/anthropic-google-openai-xai-granted-up-to-200-million-from-dod.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">worth up to $200 million</a> each to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump’s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For instance, an order that says, ‘We won’t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model’ would likely violate the First Amendment,” Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. “An order that says, ‘We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral’ would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it’s so hard to know what’s ‘neutral’ in these situations).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added: “If the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-encouraging-an-open-approach-to-ai\">Encouraging an open approach to AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/\">DeepSeek</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/alibaba-unveils-qwen-3-a-family-of-hybrid-ai-reasoning-models/\">Alibaba’s Qwen</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community’s access to private AI models and data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach — including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face — could benefit from Trump’s embrace of open AI.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-safety-and-security\">AI safety and security</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America’s national security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compared to Biden’s AI executive order, Trump’s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an “onerous” task, which Trump seems to want to limit.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-limiting-china\">Limiting China</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump’s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing “national security” threats from accessing advanced AI technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under Trump’s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America’s adversaries.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-national-security\">National security</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/trump-fires-head-of-national-security-agency-and-cyber-command/\">National security</a>” was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan — more than “data centers,” “jobs,” “science,” and other key terms. The plan’s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These signals can sense a person’s intended actions, even before they do them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal of this wristband is to provide less invasive tools to interact with computers for people with motor disabilities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is <a href=\"https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2024/07/09-wearable-sensing-tech.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">collaborating with Carnegie Mellon</a> to test the wristband with people who have spinal cord injuries, enabling them to use computers even if they are unable to fully use their arms or hands. Douglas Weber, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Neuroscience Institute, noted that even people with complete hand paralysis still exhibit some muscle activity. As a result, the device is able to interpret their intended actions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The wristband is a simpler alternative to other projects, such as Elon Musk’s <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Neuralink,</a> which aims to implant brain chips in individuals with severe paralysis. Other non-invasive approaches include headsets that utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; however, these have limitations due to the weak signals they produce. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Meta’s wristband could be used immediately without surgical intervention, and its use of sEMG signals means it operates at a higher frequency than EEG.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

YouTube says the feature can be used to add movement to landscape photos, animate pictures of everyday photos, or bring group photos to life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an example given by YouTube, the feature turns a static image of a pedestrian signal into a short video that slowly zooms into a dancing version of the walking man symbol. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/YouTube-Photo-to-video.gif?w=320\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030444\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>YouTube</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature works similarly to an <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/photo-to-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">offering already available</a> in Gemini. Plus, it’s similar to the Animate tool in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/a-guide-to-using-edits-metas-new-capcut-rival-for-short-form-video-editing/\">Meta’s Edits app</a>, which also uses AI to transform static images into videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new tool is rolling out over the next week in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. YouTube plans to bring it to more regions later this year. It’s worth noting that Google Photos is also getting a similar image-to-video tool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the new AI effects, creators can use them to transform their doodles into artistic images and turn their selfies into videos where they’re swimming underwater, twinning with someone, and more. Users can find these new effects by navigating to the “Effects” icon in the Shorts camera and then tapping “AI” to browse all of the generative effects. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/YouTube-Effect-Underwater.gif?w=320\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030449\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>YouTube</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube notes that the features announced today are powered by Veo 2, Google’s AI model for video generation. YouTube says it uses <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/science/synthid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SynthID</a> watermarks and <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-approach-to-responsible-ai-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">clear labels</a> to indicate that these creations were generated with AI.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month at Cannes Lions 2025, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-veo-3-can-generate-videos-and-soundtracks-to-go-along-with-them/\">Google’s Veo 3 video generator</a>, which can generate both video and audio, will be coming to Shorts later this summer. He also shared that Shorts are now averaging more than <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/neal-mohan-cannes-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">200 billion daily views</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube also announced on Wednesday that AI Playground is its new home for generative AI creation tools, inspirational examples, prefilled prompts, and more. Creators can find AI Playground by tapping the Create button and then the sparkle icon in the top right corner. It’s available now for everyone in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For every technology, there comes a tipping point where it switches from theory to possibility. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/fusion-power-challenges-founder-survey/\">Robin Langtry</a> believes that <a href=\"https://www.avalanchefusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Avalanche Energy</a> has reached that point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Avalanche recently operated its desktop fusion machine for hours on end while maintaining 300,000 volts, a figure the startup predicts will allow it to build a reactor capable of generating more energy than it consumes, the holy grail for any <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/fusion-power/\">fusion company</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Where other fusion companies need powerful magnets to generate energy, Avalanche’s design uses intense electrical currents to draw fast-moving ions into tight orbits around an electrode. As the density and speed of the ions rises, they begin to collide and fuse, releasing energy in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Getting to really high voltages is the key thing,” Langtry, Avalanche’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. And given that the company is building small reactors — targeting anywhere from 5 kilowatts to several hundred kilowatts — the density of that voltage, 6 million volts per meter, is important. “That’s the real unlock for us,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that sort of force, Avalanche expects it will be able to generate a large number of neutrons at low cost, which can be used to make radioisotopes and to evaluate materials for use in fusion reactors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company was recently awarded $10 million from Washington State to build FusionWERX, a testing facility where other fusion companies and researchers can book time to study their own fusion technologies. Money for the grant comes from proceeds from the state’s carbon marketplace. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can test your hardware, and then you get to leave with full ownership of your IP at the end of the day,” Langtry said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sales of radioisotopes and rentals of the FusionWERX facility should make Avalanche profitable in 2028, he said. Langtry is forecasting that the company will generate $30 million to $50 million in revenue in 2029.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a path to revenue, and having hit the 300,000-volt milestone, Avalanche is rumored to be raising a Series A round. Langtry wouldn’t comment specifically on the company’s fundraising activities, though he did say that it’s lining up the money needed to fulfill the 50% cost-match requirement of the Washington State grant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve already got a pretty good chunk of it lined up,” he said. Raising money to launch FusionWERX is “goal number one right now,” he added. “Then all the other stuff is going to fall in place as those pieces start getting built.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They’re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group’s <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/strawberries.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“Dirty Dozen” list</a> of the most contaminated produce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">San Luis Obispo, California-based <a href=\"https://www.tricrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TRIC Robotics</a> thinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth’s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,” Stager said. “We found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we’ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn’t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn’t even focused on agriculture to begin with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?” Stager said. “I was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that’s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven’t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC’s robotics.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,” Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. “We had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that’s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,” Stager said. “I just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there’s really a lot of exciting things to come.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Ben Dietderich, a spokesperson for the Department of Energy, which houses the NNSA, confirmed the department was “minimally impacted,” and that a “very small number of systems were impacted.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/hackers-exploiting-sharepoint-zero-day-seen-targeting-government-agencies-say-researchers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other government departments and agencies</a> were also compromised in an early wave of attacks exploiting the SharePoint bug, researchers confirmed.

The startup claims it now has more than 2.3 million active users, and last reported 180,000 paying subscribers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With only 45 full-time employees, and 14 open positions on its careers page, that makes for an impressive employee-to-revenue ratio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subscriptions seem to be driving the bulk of Lovable’s revenue, but the company isn’t prioritizing sales at all costs. Shortly after Lovable said it had reached <a href=\"https://x.com/antonosika/status/1935760127300337691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ARR of $75 million</a> in June, its CEO Anton Osika wrote on X that Lovable had <a href=\"https://x.com/antonosika/status/1939288991372570854\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“lost $1.5 million ARR in a single day”</a> because it had moved all users on its Team tier to its less expensive Pro tier, which now also accommodates collaboration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Teams plan is now being replaced by a Business tier, which sits between the Pro and custom Enterprise offerings. The new plan offers business-focused features such as self-serve, Single Sign-On (SSO), templates, private projects that won’t be visible to the entire team, and the option to opt-out from having your data be used for training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovable already has a slate of large customers like Klarna, HubSpot, and Photoroom, but there are still notable barriers and concerns around vibe coding among enterprises — where the big money is. This new tier could help Lovable find intermediary use cases and drive more businesses to use its tools for more than prototyping, which is what the startup says most people use it for today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has been one focus for the company, and Osika recently said that businesses were driving significant revenue from projects built with Lovable. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says more than 10 million projects have been created on Lovable to date. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $100 million ARR club isn’t large, especially in Europe, but it is growing thanks to tailwinds from all things AI.

Since then, the “women preferences” feature has rolled out to 40 countries, from Argentina and Brazil to Canada, India, and Mexico.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a few weeks, this feature will finally make its way to the United States, the company said on Wednesday. Uber plans to pilot the feature in Detroit, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Women will be able to set a preference for a woman driver in the Uber app, increasing their chances of a match. After that’s done, when a female rider requests a trip, they will see an option called “women drivers.” If the wait is longer than expected, the rider can opt for another ride, according to Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Women drivers can switch their settings to “women rider preference.” This setting can be changed if the driver wants to receive trip requests from all riders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft have grappled with ways to improve safety and attract the broadest set of users — both on the driver and rider sides. But it hasn’t been an easy road.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ride-hailing safety has been a long-standing issue, one that has often pitted advocates and regulators against companies like Uber and Lyft. And while rare, reports of sexual assaults and fatal attacks have only fueled those concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber <a href=\"https://uber.app.box.com/s/lea3xzb70bp2wxe3k3dgk2ghcyr687x3?uclick_id=46d3f8fb-cc10-450b-ba9e-c60261262b20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022, according to its latest U.S. safety report released last year. Uber noted that physical assault fatalities had jumped from previous years. While the incidents still made up a tiny fraction of the 1.8 billion trips that were made in 2021 and 2022 in the U.S., the uptick prompted the company to launch a variety of features to increase safety, including verified rider badges and options to audio and video record rides.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sexual assault incidents have dropped consistently since Uber began reporting the data in 2017. Uber reported 5,981 sexual assaults from 2017 to 2018, and that figure dropped by more than half to 2,717 in the 2021 to 2022 period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft have sought ways to attract more female drivers. Both companies have more male drivers than women — for instance, about one in five Uber drivers in the U.S. are women. The “women preferences” feature, designed to give both the rider and driver some control, could help attract more users on both sides.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber was the first major ride-hailing company to launch the women preferences feature. However, rival Lyft was the first to offer a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/12/lyfts-newest-feature-could-convince-more-women-to-drive-for-the-ride-hailing-app/\">women-matching feature in the United States</a> — its primary market. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Trump <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/president-trump-repeals-bidens-ai-executive-order/\">repealed Biden’s order within days of his inauguration</a>, arguing that its requirements could be onerous for AI companies, and may hinder American innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its first six months, the Trump administration has broadly encouraged efforts to accelerate the development and distribution of American AI technology. Trump helped OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">announce their multibillion-dollar Stargate data center project</a>, and the president <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/\">peeled back restrictions on Nvidia</a> selling its AI chips around the globe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, Trump’s AI czar David Sacks has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/trumps-silicon-valley-advisers-have-ai-censorship-in-their-crosshairs/\">picked a fight with technology companies over “woke” AI</a>, claiming that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are supposedly instilling left-leaning values into their AI chatbots and censoring conservative viewpoints. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some are already pushing back on Trump’s AI Action plan for allegedly putting corporate interests ahead of the public. On Tuesday, a group of more than 90 organizations, including labor, environmental justice, and consumer protection nonprofits, <a href=\"https://peoplesaiaction.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published an open letter called the People’s AI Action Plan</a>. This puts forth a series of AI policies that claim to put the interests of American citizens first, and counter what Trump is expected to announce.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can’t let Big Tech and Big Oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families’ well-being,” the group said in a statement to TechCrunch that acknowledged the energy needs of Silicon Valley’s AI data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI Action Plan should advance his administration’s agenda more explicitly, but exactly how remains unclear. Trump is expected to share more details about the plan at <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/president-donald-j-trump-to-deliver-keynote-address-at-winning-the-ai-race-summit-hosted-by-allin-podcast-and-hill--valley-forum-302505499.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the “Winning the AI Race” summit</a>, an event hosted by The Hill and Valley Forum and the All In podcast, which Sacks co-hosts when he’s not serving as a government official or venture capitalist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s what we know about the AI Action Plan so far.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-accelerating-american-ai\">Accelerating American AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI strategy is expected to focus on three pillars — infrastructure, innovation, and global influence — according to a report from <a href=\"https://time.com/7304389/trump-ai-action-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Time Magazine</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For infrastructure, the Trump administration is reportedly planning to overhaul permitting rules to speed up the development of AI data centers. This aims to help AI companies meet with the growing energy needs to train and serve their AI models. However, it’s widely expected that the rise of AI data centers — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">which suck up immense amounts of energy and water from neighboring communities</a> — could <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/ai-is-set-to-drive-surging-electricity-demand-from-data-centres-while-offering-the-potential-to-transform-how-the-energy-sector-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cause energy shortages by the end of the decade</a> unless there’s a rapid increase in energy production.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The president’s infrastructure pillar is also expected to include a plan to modernize America’s electrical grid and add new sources of energy to power these data centers, according to Time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the innovation front, Trump reportedly plans to use his AI Action Plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/\">revive the conversation around blocking state AI laws</a> (even though a federal proposition on the issue <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/us-senate-removes-controversial-ai-moratorium-from-budget-bill/\">overwhelmingly failed last month</a>). This is part of an effort to reduce barriers to innovation for American AI companies, but may ultimately block lawmakers from passing meaningful safety and security standards for AI companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the global influence pillar, Trump is expected to put forth a strategy to advance the adoption of American AI models and chips, not just in the U.S., but around the world. Federal officials were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape/\">spooked by the rise of DeepSeek,</a> and other Chinese AI labs such as Qwen and Moonshot AI have since become worthy competitors to OpenAI. Trump wants America’s technology to be the global standard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To advance its goals, the Trump administration is also expected to sign a series of AI-related executive orders on Wednesday, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/22/tech-brief-trump-ai-action-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post.</a> Some of these orders clear the path for faster data center buildouts, while others encourage the export of American technologies.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-combating-woke-ai\">Combating “woke” AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the executive orders Trump is slated to sign Wednesday would crack down on “woke” AI models, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24?mod=e2tw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported earlier this week. The order requires AI companies with federal contracts — which includes OpenAI, xAI, Google, and Anthropic — to ensure their AI models have neutral and unbiased language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The crackdown on “woke” AI marks the Republican party’s latest attack on Silicon Valley’s historically left-leaning crowd. In past years, Republicans investigated social media companies for allegedly altering their algorithms to censor conservative voices. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently capitulated to these allegations, and overhauled <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/meta-drops-fact-checking-and-loosens-its-content-moderation-rules/\">Facebook and Instagram’s content moderation</a> to represent more voices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key question looming around this executive order is who defines whether AI models are neutral or biased, and how they determine it. Trump has long stated he’s an advocate of free speech, so an executive order setting rules around what an AI model can and can’t say may seem counterintuitive. That said, a Florida judge recently ruled that AI chatbots <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/florida-judge-rules-ai-chatbots-not-protected-by-first-amendment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">are not protected by the First Amendment</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In light of this crackdown, OpenAI and other AI labs have tried to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/16/openai-tries-to-uncensor-chatgpt/\">make their AI chatbots represent more viewpoints</a>. These companies are in the awkward position to generate AI responses that please everyone, while also not spreading extremist viewpoints or misinformation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elon Musk, once Trump’s greatest financial backer whose relationship with the president has recently soured, explicitly started xAI to develop an “anti-woke” AI chatbot, Grok, and combat ChatGPT. However, xAI’s effort to create such a chatbot hasn’t gone so well. In recent weeks, xAI was forced to apologize repeatedly when its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/grok-is-being-antisemitic-again-and-also-the-sky-is-blue/\">AI chatbot went on antisemitic rants</a> and<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-4-seems-to-consult-elon-musk-to-answer-controversial-questions/\"> consulted Musk’s personal opinions</a> on hot-button issues.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-silicon-valley-and-big-tech-want\">What Silicon Valley and Big Tech want</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The White House announced in April it had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/public-comments-to-white-house-on-ai-policy-touch-on-copyright-tariffs/\">received more than 10,000 public comments</a> from companies, local governments, and nonprofit organizations regarding Trump’s AI Action Plan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Amazon effectively took the opportunity to submit wishlists of friendly AI policies they’d like to see the Trump administration implement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of America’s leading AI model developers asked Trump to use his AI Action plan to guarantee that training large language models on copyrighted material would be fair use, and should therefore be allowed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such a protection could benefit these companies significantly, as many of them are involved in active lawsuits with copyright owners from the music, film, news, and book industries. These publishers have accused AI companies of illegally training on their copyrighted works to make AI models, potentially devaluing their media in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Meta asked Trump to protect open AI models — which are freely available to download online. By releasing its Llama models openly, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/metas-llamacon-was-all-about-undercutting-openai/\">Meta has been able to undercut OpenAI and Google’s closed offerings</a>. However, Anthropic has raised concerns over whether open AI models could leak powerful technology to bad actors, including China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other interest groups, including nonprofits such as The Future of Life Institute, used the commenting period to ask the Trump administration to increase investment into AI research efforts outside of commercial entities. The request comes at a time when the Trump administration and <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/02/11/doge-musk-education-department-research/78411180007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DOGE have slashed funding for American universities</a>, many of which have been powerhouses for scientific breakthroughs in recent decades.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems unlikely that Trump’s AI Action Plan will feature the same safety and security reporting standards that the Biden administration sought to impose. However, polls show that <a href=\"https://theaipi.org/april-voters-prefer-ai-regulation-over-self-regulation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most Americans want AI companies to be held to safety standards</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several state lawmakers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/new-york-passes-a-bill-to-prevent-ai-fueled-disasters/\">pushing bills that would create safety and security reporting mandates</a>, but they may face opposition from the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers should they contradict Trump’s AI Action Plan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Customers can choose to add protection for more devices for $5.99 per month each. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until now, people have had to enroll their Apple devices into separate AppleCare+ plans if they wanted additional coverage for their products beyond the standard warranty. Now, the company is offering bundled coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AppleCare One includes all of the benefits of AppleCare+, including unlimited repairs for accidents like drops or spills, 24/7 support from Apple experts, and battery coverage. AppleCare One adds theft and loss protection beyond iPhone to also cover iPad and Apple Watch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the first time ever, Apple is letting customers add AppleCare coverage to the Apple products they already own. With the new subscription plan, customers can add most products up to four years old if they are in good condition. To verify that a device is in “good condition,” it may be required to undergo a diagnostic check using a customer’s iPhone or iPad, or at an Apple Store, before being added to the plan.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?w=486\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030164\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg 2743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=857,1200 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=914,1280 914w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=307,430 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=514,720 514w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=643,900 643w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=571,800 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=1463,2048 1463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=477,668 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=268,375 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=441,617 441w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=379,531 379w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AppleCare-One_plans.jpg?resize=36,50 36w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AppleCare One pricing is the same regardless of the products that are covered, meaning a customer can enroll their iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, and save up to $11 a month over enrolling in separate AppleCare+ plans for each device,” Apple explained in a press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means that if someone buys AppleCare One when they purchase a new MacBook Pro and add their iPhone to the plan, they will already be saving money by not having two separate AppleCare+ plans.

These accounts will automatically be placed into the app’s strictest message settings to prevent unwanted messages and will have the platform’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/in-the-wake-of-recent-racist-attacks-instagram-rolls-out-more-anti-abuse-features/\">“Hidden Words” feature</a> enabled to filter offensive comments. The company is also rolling out new safety features for teen accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accounts that will be placed into the new, stricter message settings include ones run by adults who regularly share photos and videos of their children, along with accounts run by parents or talent managers that represent children.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While these accounts are overwhelmingly used in benign ways, unfortunately, there are people who may try to abuse them, leaving sexualized comments under their posts or asking for sexual images in DMs, in clear violation of our rules,” the company wrote in their blog post. “Today we’re announcing steps to help prevent this abuse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it will attempt to prevent potentially suspicious adults, such as people who have already been blocked by teens, from finding accounts that primarily feature children. Meta will avoid recommending suspicious adults to these accounts on Instagram, and vice versa, and make it harder for them to find each other in Instagram Search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s announcement comes as Meta and Instagram have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/08/meta-introduces-restricted-teen-accounts-to-facebook-and-messenger/\">taken steps</a> over the past year to address mental health concerns tied to social media. These concerns have been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/10/state-attorneys-endorse-social-media-warning-labels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised by the U.S. Surgeon General</a> and various states, some of which have even <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/to-protect-teens-on-social-media-new-york-targets-the-algorithms-8b5feaae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">gone so far as to require</a> parental consent for access to social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes will significantly impact the accounts of family vloggers/creators and parents running accounts for “kidfluencers,” both of which have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-dangers-of-parents-sharing-their-childrens-lives-on-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">faced criticism for the risks associated</a> with sharing children’s lives on social media. A New York Times investigation published last year found that the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/us/instagram-child-influencers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">parents are often aware</a> of their child’s exploitation or even participating in it, by selling photos or clothing their child wore. In The NYT’s examination of 5,000 parent-run accounts, it found 32 million connections to male followers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the accounts that are placed into these stricter settings will see a notification at the top of their Instagram Feed notifying them that the social network has updated their safety settings. The notice will also prompt them to review their account privacy settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta notes it has removed almost 135,000 Instagram accounts that were sexualizing accounts that primarily feature children, as well as 500,000 Instagram and Facebook accounts that were associated with the original accounts it had removed.  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030223\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=768,669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=680,592 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=1200,1045 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=1280,1114 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=430,374 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=720,627 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=900,784 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=800,697 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=1536,1337 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=668,582 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=431,375 431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=709,617 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=610,531 610w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image001.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside today’s announcement, Meta is also bringing new safety features to DMs in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/17/instagram-tightens-restrictions-on-teen-accounts-putting-parents-in-control/\">Teen Accounts</a>, its app experience with built-in protections for teens that are automatically applied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teens will now see new options to view safety tips, reminding them to check profiles carefully and be mindful of what they share. Plus, the month and year that the account joined Instagram will be displayed at the top of new chats. In addition, Instagram has added a new block and report option that lets users do both things at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new features are designed to give teens more context about the accounts they’re messaging and help them spot potential scammers, Meta says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These new features complement the safety notices we show to remind people to be cautious in private messages and to block and report anything that makes them uncomfortable — and we’re encouraged to see teens responding to them,” Meta wrote in the blog post. “In June alone, they blocked accounts 1 million times and reported another 1 million after seeing a safety notice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta also provided an update on its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/11/meta-will-auto-blur-nudity-in-instagram-dms-in-latest-teen-safety-step/\">nudity protection filter</a>, noting that 99% of people, including teens, have kept it turned on. Last month, over 40% of blurred images received in DMs stayed blurred, the company said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
