In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Employees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re glad to hear the CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic condemning the ICE murders,” the ICEout.tech organizers, whose identities remain unknown, told TechCrunch. “Now we need to hear from CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta, all of whom have remained silent despite calls all across the industry.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Amodei and Altman may be taking something of a stand – one in public, the other internally – both CEOs couched their statements with praise for President Trump, as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/walz-trump-phone-call-minneapolis-minnesota-alex-pretti-renee-good/\">independent investigation</a> into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Alex Pretti’s death  circulated online. (It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-growing-number-of-republicans-criticize-trump-admin-response/\">growing number of Republicans have begun to call for</a> an investigation, as well.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">J.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year, OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\">$100 billion at an $830 billion valuation</a>, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/sequoia-joins-gic-coatue-in-25b-anthropic-funding-at-350b-valuation-ft/ar-AA1UszTG?apiversion=v2&amp;domshim=1&amp;noservercache=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1#:~:text=Venture%20capital%20firm%20Sequoia%20Capital,Cisco%20(CSCO)%20and%20YouTube.\">$25 billion at a $350 billion valuation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, such words of praise for Trump is an about face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/trump\">own blog</a>:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/anthropics-ceo-stuns-davos-with-nvidia-criticism/\">calling the decision “crazy”</a> last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and OpenAI for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with comment from J.J.

This includes the U.S, where it will cost $7.99 per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion brings the lower-cost plan to 35 new countries and territories, after earlier launches in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/googles-cheaper-ai-plus-plan-is-now-available-in-over-40-countries/\">dozens of global markets,</a> which began <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1965490977000640833\">with Indonesia</a> last September.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan includes access to Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro in the Gemini app, Flow’s AI filmmaking tools, research and writing assistance in NotebookLM, and more. It also offers 200GB of storage and the ability to share your plan benefits with up to five other family members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Existing Google One Premium 2TB subscribers will automatically gain access to all Google AI Plus plan benefits over the next few days, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially focused on emerging markets, the Google AI Plus plan is designed as the first step beyond free access to Gemini and other AI tools for those who either don’t need or can’t afford to subscribe to the more expensive <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://one.google.com/intl/en/about/google-ai-plans/\">Google AI Pro plan</a>, which is typically priced at $20 per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Plus plan’s price point varies by region, its $8 per month price point could introduce a new, more casual audience to Google’s AI technology here in the United States. Elsewhere, the plan tends to cost less than $5 per month. For instance, users in India pay ₹399 ($4.44 USD) per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it first debuted, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1965490977000640833\">Google explained that the plan</a> was designed to bring access to Gemini, Veo, and other creative AI tools to emerging markets at a more affordable price point. It’s also designed to compete with OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChatGPT Go plan</a>, which is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://chatgpt.com/pricing\">$8 per month</a> in the U.S., or less in some emerging markets.

Designed as an AI-enhanced word processor and research tool for scientific papers, Prism is deeply integrated with GPT-5.2, which can be used to assess claims, revise prose, or search for prior research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prism isn’t designed to conduct research on its own and without human guidance. Executives believe it will accelerate the work being done by human scientists and compared Prism to coding interfaces like Cursor and Windsurf. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI and software engineering,” Kevin Weill, VP of OpenAI for Science, said in a press call announcing the tool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new software, which is accessed via a web app, comes as OpenAI is seeing a flood of scientific queries coming to its consumer products like ChatGPT. The company says that ChatGPT receives an average of 8.4 million messages a week on advanced topics in the hard sciences — although it’s difficult to know how many are from professional researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-assisted research is also becoming more common among academic researchers. In mathematics, AI models have been used to prove <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/ai-models-are-starting-to-crack-high-level-math-problems/\">a number of long-standing Erdos problems</a> through a combination of literature review and new applications of existing techniques. While the significance of the proofs is still hotly debated, the results have been an early victory for proponents of AI models and formal verification systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10220\">A statistics paper published in December</a> used GPT 5.2 Pro to establish new proofs for a central axiom of statistical theory, with human researchers only prompting and verifying the model’s work. OpenAI applauded the result <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-2-for-science-and-math/\">in a blog post</a>, presenting it as a model for human-AI collaboration in research going forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In domains with axiomatic theoretical foundations,” the post reads, “frontier models can help explore proofs, test hypotheses, and identify connections that might otherwise take substantial human effort to uncover.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the value of OpenAI’s new system comes from simple product work on existing standards. Prism integrates with LaTeX, an open-source system used to format and typeset scientific papers, but goes significantly beyond most available LaTeX software tools. The program also leverages GPT 5.2’s visual capabilities to allow researchers to assemble diagrams from online whiteboard drawings, which can be a significant pain point with existing tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the most powerful feature comes from combining the usual powers of an AI model with more rigorous context management. When users open up a ChatGPT window through Prism, the model can access the full context of the research project, making responses both more germane and more intelligent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of that would be possible for a savvy user of GPT-5.2, but OpenAI is hoping that a cleaner interface will draw in scientific researchers more quickly. Weill described it as the same combination of factors that made AI tools so powerful in software engineering.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Software engineering accelerated in part because of amazing models,” he told reporters, “and in part because of deep workflow integration.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The United States is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its authority. Several <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-judge-icc-trump-1.7613704\">other ICC judges and prosecutors</a> have also been sanctioned by the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prost, whose name now shares the same list as some of the world’s most dangerous people, from terrorists to North Korean hackers and Iranian spies, described the effect of sanctions on her life as “paralyzing” in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2025/12/12/its-surreal-us-sanctions-lock-international-criminal-court-judge-out-of-daily-life/\">an interview by The Irish Times</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This high-profile case provides a glimpse into the disruption that being cut off from the U.S. can have on a person’s everyday life; lawmakers and government leaders across Europe are growing more aware of the looming threat facing them at home, and their over-reliance on U.S. technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s diplomatic escalations and the upending of international norms, including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/live-updates-u-s-captures-maduro-and-his-wife-after-striking-venezuela\">the capture a foreign leader</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74x4m71pmjo\">threatening to invade a NATO and European ally</a>, have caused some EU countries to consider moving away from U.S. tech and reclaim their digital sovereignty. This shift in thinking comes as the Trump administration has become increasingly unpredictable and vindictive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Belgium, the country’s cybersecurity chief Miguel De Bruycker conceded in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/854fcad0-0d39-438b-975b-adf9d8b89827\">a recent interview</a> that Europe has “lost the internet” to the United States, which has hoarded much of the world’s tech and financial systems. De Bruycker said it is “currently impossible” to store data fully in Europe as a result of U.S. dominating digital infrastructure, and urged the European Union to strengthen its tech across the bloc.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The European Parliament voted January 22 to adopt a report directing the European Commission to identify areas where the EU can reduce its reliance on foreign providers.

But that gap is narrowing, according to <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/obi-releases-data-analysis-of-tesla-and-waymo-rideshare-pricing-wait-times-and-sentiments-302669664.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new data published Tuesday</a> by Obi, a company that aggregates real-time pricing and pick-up times across multiple ride-hailing services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two factors, working together, are behind the change. Waymo has lowered its pricing, at least in the San Francisco Bay Area where the data was pulled, while traditional ride-hailing rides on the Uber and Lyft networks have risen, according to Obi. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new data was collected between November 27 and January 1, with Obi simulating more than 94,000 ride requests in the Bay Area. The company found that Waymo rides cost an average of $19.69, while Uber rides were slightly cheaper at $17.47. Lyft rides across the same period averaged $15.47. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June, Obi <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/waymo-rides-cost-more-than-uber-or-lyft-and-people-are-paying-anyway/\">released its first report</a> analyzing robotaxi versus ride-hailing data. The data, which was taken from rides in April 2025, showed Waymo rides averaged $20.43, Uber landed at $15.58, and Lyft rides evened out at $14.44. Compared to these figures, Waymo’s average cost has dropped 3.62%, while Uber’s went up 12%, and Lyft’s climbed 7%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obi CEO Ashwini Anburajan told TechCrunch she believes this is a trend to watch because, while last April’s data implied customers were willing to pay a higher price to ride in a Waymo, the “novelty is wearing off for people in the Bay Area.” That means Waymo will likely keep having to price its offering more competitively, she said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-wildcard-tesla\">The wildcard: Tesla</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The wildcard in Obi’s new report is that it collected data on Tesla’s burgeoning robotaxi service, which appears to be far cheaper than these other three offerings. But there are a number of important caveats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, Tesla isn’t technically operating a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area, where the data was sampled. Tesla doesn’t have the permits required to operate a driverless commercial robotaxi service in the state. Nor does it have a transportation network company permit like Uber or Lyft. Instead, Tesla has a transportation charter permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, which means the company uses employees to drive the company’s vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving software. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s Bay Area fleet is also modest. Crowdsourced data from the website Robotaxi Tracker has helped log <a href=\"https://robotaxitracker.com/vehicles?area=bay_area\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">around 168 vehicles</a> in Tesla’s ride-hail fleet, though not all of those cars are active all the time. (Obi notes in the report that only 156 were spotted by the crowdsourced website at the time the company ran its data sampling.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That smaller fleet has driven by wait times. Of the four services surveyed, Tesla had the longest wait time with an average ETA of 15.32 minutes. Waymo’s average wait time was 5.74 minutes (up from 4.28 minutes last April), while Lyft and Uber came in at 5.14 minutes and 3.15 minutes, respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These inputs — fleet size, human drivers, wait times — could have all affect how Tesla prices rides at true scale, and it’s hard to say when and how that might happen. Tesla only just recently pulled safety monitors out of a handful of cars in Austin, Texas. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Tesla can scale its robotaxis — which rely on camera inputs alone — the company should theoretically be able to price rides lower than competitors like Waymo which, integrates its self-driving software into modified vehicles equipped with several different kinds of sensors. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-popularity-contest\">Popularity contest</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anburajan thinks there’s value in Tesla operating a ride-hailing service, ahead of any attempt at operating true robotaxis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not really a autonomous vehicle at the moment. It has a safety driver in it. They’re building brand familiarity. They’re building brand preference for people that already like Teslas and people who are inclined to like Tesla,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s some evidence of this in the report Obi released Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with the ride requests sampled in the Bay Area, Obi surveyed 2,000 people in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas on a number of issues related to robotaxis and ride-hailing. Over half of those respondents who had taken an autonomous vehicle ride said they’d ridden in a Tesla robotaxi. And when asked which autonomous brand they preferred the most, respondents chose Tesla 31% of the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo was still the most preferred, with 39.8% of respondents choosing the Alphabet-owned brand. But this strong preference for Tesla, despite the company not operating a real robotaxi service at any scale yet, hints at future demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That strong preference for Tesla is also being driven in large part by a particular group: men. Women who were surveyed by Obi were essentially evenly split when it comes to choosing Waymo or Tesla, with Zoox a distant third at 8%. But 56% of men surveyed preferred Tesla to Waymo (25%) or Zoox (7%). </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obi’s report offers a good baseline ahead of a year that’s sure to see many developments in the world of autonomous vehicles. Waymo is rapidly expanding into new cities, even partnering with Uber and Lyft in some of them. Those ride-hail companies are bringing many other autonomous vehicle partners onto their platforms, too. And Tesla will likely look to prove its robotaxi approach works in order to expand its nascent offering.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is also about to start offering rides in a new van-like vehicle that it is building with Chinese company Zeekr. That vehicle, known as Ojai, is expected to have a lower up-front cost for Waymo and could allow the company to get more aggressive on pricing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One thing is clear to Anburajan, though: real competition is coming. Other companies are preparing to launch their own robotaxi services. Nuro is supplying its self-driving system to modified Lucid Gravity vehicles as part of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/this-is-ubers-new-robotaxi-from-lucid-and-nuro/\">premium robotaxi network </a>that will be operated by Uber. Hyundai-backed Motional has rebooted its efforts and plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/motional-puts-ai-at-center-of-robotaxi-reboot-as-it-targets-2026-for-driverless-service/\">launch a commercial robotaxi service</a> in Las Vegas before the end of the year. And other companies like Avride <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/uber-and-avride-launch-robotaxi-service-in-dallas/\">have partnered with Uber</a> to bring robotaxis to other U.S. cities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s still very early in the game, so no one’s a late entrant, right?” she said. “We’re in this new era, so who’s gonna capture market share and move fast to win consumers over?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While children’s online safety is a pressing concern, privacy advocates argue that the type of cloud-based age verification methods mandated by legislation like OSA harms adults by collecting swaths of highly sensitive data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In other jurisdictions, Aylo has often been one of the only major platforms to comply, only to see traffic diverted to even larger, non-compliant sites,” the company said. Sites that do not comply with OSA are supposed to get fined, but Aylo claims that so far, only the forum 4chan has been fined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ofcom also disagrees with Aylo’s claim that it is not punishing porn sites for non-compliance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve taken strong and swift action against non-compliance, launching investigations into more than 80 porn sites and fining a porn provider £1 million, with more to come,” Ofcom said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to block access in the U.K. is consistent with Aylo’s decisions around navigating compliance with age verification laws in the United States. Aylo’s websites are blocked in a number of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/pornhub-disables-access-in-texas-due-to-age-verification-law/\">U.S. states</a> where age verification is mandated for adult content, since the company believes that age verification software opens the door to the threat of data breaches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These fears are not unfounded. Pornhub was, in fact, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/hacking-group-says-its-extorting-pornhub-after-stealing-users-viewing-data/\">vulnerable to a data breach</a> at the web and mobile analytics provider Mixpanel, which exposed data about some Pornhub Premium subscribers.

We’re committed to bringing TikTok back to its full capacity as soon as possible. We’ll continue to provide updates. Thanks for your patience.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has not named the data center partner at fault; however, the U.S. has been impacted of a large winter storm over the past few days, which affected <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/winter-storm-live-updates-tracking-dangerous-ice-snow/?id=129469173\">some 220 million Americans</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of the glitches has led some users to question the veracity of TikTok’s statements, as the disruption also occurred as civil unrest <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/minute-minute-timeline-fatal-shooting-alex-pretti-federal/story?id=129547199\">began heating up</a> after U.S. citizen Alex Pretti was killed by ICE agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2015936397073437004\">a prior post</a>, TikTok noted that U.S. users may experience “multiple bugs, slower load times, or timed-out requests, including when posting new content,” as the infrastructure issues continue.

The company said in a blog post that this update will give users “a best-in-class AI response right on the search results page.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tuesday’s announcements mark Google’s ongoing efforts to make Search less of a static search results experience and more of an interactive, AI-driven experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People come to Search for an incredibly wide range of questions — sometimes to find information quickly, like a sports score or the weather, where a simple result is all you need,” Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search, said in a blog post. “But for complex questions or tasks where you need to explore a topic deeply, you should be able to seamlessly tap into a powerful conversational AI experience.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says its testing shows that users prefer an experience that flows naturally into a conversation and that asking follow-up questions while preserving context from AI Overviews makes Search more helpful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new experience is designed to feel like a single flow, with links that let users move from a quick snapshot to a deeper conversation as needed, the tech giant says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updates come a few days after Google announced that it’s bringing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/googles-ai-mode-can-now-tap-into-your-gmail-and-photos-to-provide-tailored-responses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“Personal Intelligence” to AI Mode</a>, enabling it to tap into your Gmail and Google Photos to provide more individualized responses.

Now users will have access to a dedicated on/off toggle switch in the device’s settings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The devices will also offer stronger protection against a thief trying to guess a device owner’s PIN, pattern, or password by increasing the lockout time after failed attempts. Plus, Identity Check, a feature rolled out for Android 15 and higher last year, now covers all features and apps that use biometrics — like banking apps or the Google Password Manager. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Remote Lock, a tool that lets you lock a lost or stolen device from a web browser, will now include an optional security challenge or question. With this feature, available to Android 10+, only the real device owner can initiate the lock for added security. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Brazil, two theft protection features will now be enabled by default, including the Theft Detection Lock, which uses on-device AI to sense motion that could indicate a “snatch-and-run” theft. The Remote Lock feature will also be automatically turned on and accessible from the website android.com/lock. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We are studying them, if possible, [will] implement a similar ban on children below 16 for usage of social media.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Goa, the southern state of Andhra Pradesh is also considering adopting Australia’s approach. Earlier this month, the state’s IT and education minister, Nara Lokesh, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/andhra-pradesh-mulling-australia-like-under-16-social-media-ban-nara-lokesh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggested the move</a>, saying officials were studying Australia’s law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe we need to create a strong legal enactment,” Lokesh said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Andhra Pradesh government has already <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-govt-mulls-australia-style-restrictions-on-social-media-access-for-children-under-16/articleshow/127242574.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">constituted</a> a group of ministers to study whether restrictions or a ban on minors’ access to social media platforms would be legally and practically feasible. The panel is chaired by Lokesh and includes key cabinet ministers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the two Indian states, the issue has also drawn judicial scrutiny, with the Madras High Court <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/consider-law-like-australia-to-ban-under-16s-from-social-media-madras-high-court-9978085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">urging</a> India’s federal government in December to consider Australia-style restrictions, highlighting how concerns about children’s online safety are driving regulatory debates well beyond legislatures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Any move to restrict children’s access to social media in India would carry significant implications for global technology companies, for which the South Asian nation is a critical growth market. Government estimates put India’s internet user base at <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2206477\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 1 billion</a>, with a large share of those users coming online at a young age, making the country central to the user and advertising strategies of platforms such as Meta, Google, and X.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Meta spokesperson said the company shared lawmakers’ goal of creating “safe, positive online experiences for young people,” but argued that parents — rather than governments — should decide which apps their teenagers use. “Governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites, or logged-out experiences that bypass important protections — like the default safeguards we offer in Instagram’s Teen Accounts,” the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/australia-approves-law-banning-social-media-for-users-under-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Passed</a> through the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024 and approved by parliament in November 2024 before taking effect in December 2025, Australia’s under-16 social media ban has already exposed enforcement challenges for platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/with-upcoming-ban-meta-begins-to-notify-australian-teens-that-their-accounts-will-be-shut-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">began notifying</a> Australian teenagers that their accounts would be shut down, signaling the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/07/as-australia-bans-social-media-for-kids-under-16-age-assurance-tech-is-in-the-spotlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">difficulty of accurately determining users’ ages</a>, particularly when people are not always truthful at sign-up.

He added that some states, including Andhra Pradesh, are therefore likely to seek the central government’s support — an outcome that remains uncertain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aprajita Rana, a partner at corporate law firm AZB &amp; Partners, echoed Rizvi’s view on the limits of state-level action, saying that while an Australia-style ban would be unprecedented in a market of India’s size, blanket restrictions risk pushing children away from regulated platforms toward unmonitored online spaces, potentially undermining the very safety goals policymakers are seeking to achieve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/india-digital-personal-data-protection-bill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">passed</a> in August 2023, includes specific protections for children’s data, requiring verifiable parental consent before processing personal data of individuals under 18 and prohibiting tracking, behavioral monitoring, and targeted advertising directed at minors. However, the operational rules for these <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/dpdp-rules-and-the-future-of-child-data-safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">provisions are being phased in through 2027</a>, giving platforms time to implement the required safeguards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, Snap, and X did not respond to requests for comment.

The company is instead focusing on offering that technology to third parties, like concession stands at sports stadiums.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we’ve seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven’t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,” the company wrote in its blog post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These retail closures will not impact customers who use Amazon for grocery delivery. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not surprising that Amazon will divest from its branded retail stores, given that Amazon has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/amazon-closes-more-of-its-cashierless-convenience-stores/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cutting down</a> on its physical retail presence over the last few years. Upon closing down some stores in 2024, an Amazon spokesperson said that the company “couldn’t make the economics work with the lease cost.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon isn’t giving up on the brick-and-mortar side of its business, though. Instead, it will embrace the fact that people have a stronger brand affinity with Whole Foods Market than the Amazon Go convenience store. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon will open more than 100 new Whole Foods stores over the next few years.

Major players like Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Freshworks currently dominate the space, but lots of smaller startups are betting that reshuffling workflows will give them a chance to cut in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.tryrisotto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Risotto</a> is one of those startups, and after today, it will have plenty of runway to test its theory. The company on Tuesday said it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bonfire Ventures, with participation from 645 Ventures, Y Combinator, Ritual Capital, and SurgePoint Capital.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Designed to autonomously resolve help desk tickets, Risotto sits between ticket management systems like Jira and the complex internal tooling needed to resolve them. The product is built on a third-party foundation model, but CEO Aron Solberg says the core of the business is the infrastructure that sits between the model and the customer, keeping the non-deterministic nature of the model in check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our special sauce is the prompt libraries, the eval suites, and the thousands and thousands of real-world examples that the AI gets trained on to ensure it actually does what it’s expected to do,” Solberg told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Working with the payroll company <a href=\"https://gusto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gusto</a>, Risotto was able to automate away 60% of the company’s support tickets. Its current work is focused on conventional ticketing systems, but Risotto is also positioning itself for a more radical shift in the industry, as AI triggers more fundamental changes in the way help desks function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With 95% of our customers, humans still solve tickets the traditional way,” Solberg said. “But we see the newer companies shifting to have the primary interface between humans and the technology be an LLM.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practical terms, this would mean tasks are managed through tools like ChatGPT for Enterprise, which coordinate help-desk tickets alongside a range of other professional tasks. Solberg says his team has already worked on integrations with ChatGPT for Enterprise and Gemini, connecting Risotto over MCP.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that approach becomes more common, it would mean significant changes for the industry at large. Risotto and similar products would function as tools that would be called by a central AI, offering more focused and reliable service than a general-purpose system could perform on its own. It’s a new paradigm for thinking about SaaS products — one where reliability and context-management are more important than human-friendly interfaces.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Risotto’s most immediate value proposition comes from taming the mess of different IT systems. As Solberg sees it, there is still plenty of value in making it easier to use existing ticketing systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of our customers has four full-time employees just to manage Jira,” Solberg says. “And that’s to say nothing about implementing AI. That’s just to wrangle the platform itself.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup is laser-focused on building an AI shopping agent, but also, after a snowstorm barreled through New York City, Phia founders Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni can’t leave their respective apartments. So it’s a rarity that when I chat with the former Stanford roommates and best friends, they are not together, nor are they in the Phia office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were like, ‘It’s okay, stay home.’ It’s dangerous. Nobody needs to go to the office,” Kianni told TechCrunch, laughing. But while she and Gates hunkered down at home, many of their employees still made the trek to the office. “Our team is sending Slack photos right now … The entire porch is snow.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such is the life of a fast-growing startup. Phia is 10 months old, yet it just closed a $35 million funding round led by Notable Capital with participation from Khosla Ventures and returning investor Kleiner Perkins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a quick turnaround. When I <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/phias-founders-on-how-ai-is-changing-online-shopping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last spoke with Phia</a> in October on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> stage, they were just one month removed from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/phias-founders-on-how-ai-is-changing-online-shopping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an $8 million round</a> that included checks from celebrity investors like Kris Jenner, Sara Blakely, and Sheryl Sandberg. (Yes, Phoebe Gates is the daughter of Bill and Melinda; no, her parents are not bankrolling her startup.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are just at such a prime time of opportunity,” Gates said to explain the new fundraise. “Commerce itself for the consumer hasn’t really been adapted in the last 30 years, and the opportunity to make a truly personalized, end-to-end shopping experience is today.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With hundreds of thousands of monthly active users, Phia has achieved 11x revenue growth since launch and onboarded 6,200 retail partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it stands, Phia is a mobile app and a web browser extension that seeks to help shoppers save money by showing them resale or secondhand alternatives to the products they’re looking for. If you’re about to buy a brand-new Anthropologie dress for $200, for example, Phia could show you that the same dress is available on Poshmark for $80. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a sustainability angle to buying secondhand — Kianni is a <a href=\"https://www.climatecardinals.org/sophiakianni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">climate activist</a> and former adviser to the United Nations — but as a tech company, the founders understand that their way to build a customer base is to simply help them save money. Beyond resale options, Phia might also recommend similar items from less expensive brands, which is where its partnerships come in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A lot of [brand partners] were very much taking a bet on us and joining the platform when we had less proof points,” said Kianni. When brands make sales on Phia, the app gets a cut, similar to an affiliate marketing model. “With new offerings that we have, we actually have data to be able to show things like, we can give them a 15% increase in average order value, or 30% stronger new customer acquisition, or 50% lower return rates.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of Phia’s success stems from its founder-led marketing tactics. As Gen Z digital natives, Gates and Kianni have amassed over 2 million followers across social media platforms. This includes their podcast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@theburnoutspodcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Burnouts</a>, in which the duo talk about their entrepreneurship journey and interview prominent figures in business and entertainment, from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/the-spectacle-of-bryan-johnson-and-his-livestreamed-shrooms-trip/\">Bryan Johnson</a> to Paris Hilton.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Phia founders have ambitions to turn the app into what Gates calls a “holistic shopping agent,” which is why the company plans to use its newfound capital to recruit top machine learning engineers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our number one goal was always bringing the top engineering talent specifically into our company, and being able to have capital that can really attract the best people,” Kianni said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3086527\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/54887275350_05af282714_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The current Phia team, who all work out of the New York office (so long as there’s not a massive snowstorm), is about 20 people, which is small for a company with somewhat nebulous ambitions to revolutionize commerce — but as Kianni puts it, “It’s not even about team size anymore. It’s just about the quality of the talent you’re attracting.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To bring their ideas to fruition, they’re going to need that kind of talent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Gone are the days where you would go to a static HTML page that’s not personalized for you, your taste, your sizes, and what you already own that’s in your closet,” Gates said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the company grows, she wants people to “go to Phia first, really to start that shopping journey from the top of the funnel, both with your own personalized feed and outfit recommendations for you based on your current closet, or understanding what you might want to donate or sell.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In order to create such personalized experiences, however, Phia needs to collect user data, which is tricky to accomplish in a secure manner that keeps users informed about how much they’re sharing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/15/phia-ai-shopping-agent-bill-gates-phoebe-gates-sophia-kianni-collecting-user-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported by Fortune</a> in November, cybersecurity researchers found a feature in Phia’s browser extension that was able to capture the HTML code of the websites users visited while using the extension, essentially collecting data from their browser history. The company removed the feature once notified and said in a statement to Fortune that “the extension previously logged webpage content to understand if the site was a shopping destination,” and that Phia has “never in the past, or at present, stored this data.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We always are extremely transparent with users about the reasons why we are requesting certain permissions, and everything is displayed very clearly up front,” Kianni said. “In terms of the way that we’re building our tech and our back end, we’ve always made sure all data is aggregated, anonymous, and only used for the purpose of being able to help users find the best products as efficiently as possible.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hopefully that incident is remembered as a growing pain for the startup, and not an indicator of problems to come — because Phia is right that online shopping could use a makeover. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that’s where AI agents play a huge role,” Kianni said. “All this cumbersome, manual work really can become compressed and be able to get you to the shortest path possible to the perfect item.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re on the cusp of a completely new way of shopping,” Gates added. “We want to make the entire ecosystem just way more efficient and make shopping fun again.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It might sound crazy to some, launching an entirely new product line while your flagship business has shed two-thirds of its paper value. But Howie Liu, the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.airtable.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Airtable</a>, suggests it’s the sanest thing he could do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company that investors valued at $11.7 billion during the zero-interest-rate fervor of 2021 now trades on secondary markets at roughly $4 billion. But Airtable has raised $1.4 billion total, and Liu says the company still has half of that in the bank while “throwing off cash.” The valuation collapse affected investor returns and employee stock options but didn’t undermine the business itself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu’s response is to launch <a href=\"https://superagent.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Superagent</a>, an AI agent he suggests could eventually eclipse Airtable itself. It’s Airtable’s first stand-alone product in its 13-year history and captures both where the company is headed and the reality of the current AI moment: Every serious software player is racing to prove they can deliver on agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To understand what makes this move especially interesting, consider what Airtable is: a no-code platform that democratizes app-building. It’s essentially a supercharged database that lets anyone create custom software tailored to their workflows. The company now employs more than 700 people and serves over 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100. This isn’t a struggling startup but instead a mature business betting its future on a new architecture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Superagent represents Liu’s bet on “multi-agent coordination” — a system where you ask a question and get not one AI assistant fumbling through sequential tasks, but a coordinating agent that deploys specialists working in parallel. “You’re not prompting an AI,” Liu explains. “You’re orchestrating a team.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s how it works: When you ask Superagent about expanding your athleisure brand into Europe (an example from Liu), the system first builds a research plan, identifying what needs investigation and surfacing dimensions you didn’t think to ask about. Then it deploys specialized agents in parallel — one investigating financials, another analyzing competitive positioning, another reviewing management and news. Finally, it synthesizes everything into a finished deliverable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The output isn’t a wall of text. It’s an interactive market analysis with demographic breakdowns, competitive presence mapped visually, and expansion timelines you can filter and explore. “What if every person could have New York Times-quality data visualization built for every task they have?” Liu told me over Zoom last week. “This would have been unfathomable 10 years ago, or five years ago, where you don’t get that quality of output — you just get text. But to be able to now get truly extremely high-quality, rich interactive outputs as a default format, I think that’s a game changer.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The distinction Liu draws between Superagent and competitors is technical. He name-checks Anthropic’s AI agent Claude and Manus (a newer entrant in the AI research space that’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">being acquired by Meta</a>) as the only two products with “a true, generally capable, long-running and really smart agent architecture.” Most other so-called agents, he argues, are merely “LLM powered workflows” — predetermined steps with AI calls mixed in, not true autonomous agents that can course-correct and backtrack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a fine line in a market where everyone is suddenly launching AI agents. OpenAI kicked off 2025 by launching new agent-building tools, while Notion, Harvey, and hundreds of other companies have since added agent functionality. In a market steeped with agent claims, Liu’s insistence that Superagent is different will need to prove itself in practice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a blog post announcing the product, Liu provides examples of what Superagent can do. Ask it to evaluate Google as a three-year investment opportunity, he writes, and you get a structured assessment with citations to earnings calls, defensibility analysis against OpenAI and Anthropic, and risk factors you hadn’t considered. Ask it to brief you on Wells Fargo’s AI strategy before pitching them, and you get their regulatory posture, recent AI investments, and specific pain points your product addresses. The system pulls from premium data sources like FactSet, Crunchbase, SEC filings, and earnings transcripts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move caps a transformation for Airtable, which Liu has been repositioning as an “AI-native platform.” Last fall, the company brought in David Azose, formerly the engineering lead for ChatGPT’s business products at OpenAI, as CTO. At the same time, it <a href=\"https://www.upstartsmedia.com/p/airtable-hires-cto-openai-acquires-deepsky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquired DeepSky</a> (formerly Gradient), an AI agent startup that had raised $40 million. Superagent will operate semi-independently from Airtable, helmed by DeepSky’s founding trio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pricing was still being hammered out as of last week, but it sounded poised to follow the emerging AI products playbook: $20 per month per user at the entry tier, up to $200 for power users, with generous inference credits. “We’re not trying to optimize for profit margin right now,” Liu says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether Superagent becomes the trillion-dollar market Liu envisions or a big bet that doesn’t pan out remains to be seen. The competition is not trivial, and the distinctions Liu draws between “real agents” and the rest may not matter to customers if the others can deliver adequate results faster and cheaper.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But for a CEO whose company has lost $7.7 billion in paper valuation while retaining most of its actual capital, the move shows a willingness to bet on the future rather than protect the present. Indeed, Liu has reframed that earlier valuation compression as a recruiting advantage, telling employees they’re getting “equity that’s actually much more attractively priced than the $11 billion valuation” with significant upside if his bets pay off. He has capital for strategic acquisitions and doesn’t need to raise another round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked if he thinks Superagent is ultimately the bigger opportunity, Liu shrugs — he’s not ruling it out. Airtable “will probably be larger for at least the near term than any new products that we do, including Superagent,” he says. “But I also like being able to bet on Superagent. Optionality is a good thing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is Liu’s version of what he calls “wartime” leadership — a term he admits he once eschewed as needlessly violent but now embraces as apt. “Being very fast on the draw to be able to adapt,” he says, is “the most value-creative way to run things right now.” He quickly adds, “It’s also the most exciting way to do things.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001506293/000150629326000009/pins-20260122.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">regulatory filing</a>, the company noted it expects to complete the layoffs by late September.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The filing stated that Pinterest would be “reallocating resources to AI-focused roles and teams that drive AI adoption and execution” and “prioritizing AI‑powered products and capabilities.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company had 4,666 full-time employees at the end of 2024, which means roughly 700 workers will be affected by cuts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as Pinterest, and every other tech company, has been investing in AI. A few months ago, the company <a href=\"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/news/pinterest-assistant-revolutionizing-the-way-you-shop-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched “Pinterest Assistant,”</a> an AI companion users can talk to for shopping advice and recommendations.

(Quantum Computing Inc. had upped its bid to $28 million but apparently was unwilling or unable to go higher.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement, MicroVision said Tuesday that it is acquiring “IP and inventory related to the Iris and Halo lidar sensors, key engineering and operations talent, and certain commercial contracts and orders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s no secret that the lidar market has been ripe for disruption and in need of further consolidation,” MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said. “Building on our proven executive leadership in automotive, our history of developing and delivering products in defense, and now an even more expansive portfolio of technologically diverse lidar sensors and advanced perception solutions, we believe MicroVision is ready to upend the industry, enabling widespread commercial adoption and significantly increased safety.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sale of Luminar’s lidar business will now be subject to approval by the judge in the bankruptcy case. A hearing is slated for Tuesday afternoon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear whether Luminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell submitted a bid for his company’s lidar assets. Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/ousted-luminar-ceo-austin-russell-wants-to-buy-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tried to buy the company</a> outright in October 2025 before it filed for bankruptcy, and he expressed an interest in making a bid during the bankruptcy process. Representatives for Russell did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Russell and Luminar spent the first month of the bankruptcy case fighting over a subpoena. The company has said it is still evaluating whether to take legal action against Russell, tied to his resignation last May, which followed a board-run ethics inquiry. While Russell already turned over his computers to Luminar, he had been holding on to his phone until he received a guarantee from the company that any personal information on the device would be protected. Luminar accused him of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/luminar-claims-founder-austin-russell-is-dodging-a-subpoena-in-the-bankruptcy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dodging the subpoena</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell ultimately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/luminar-founder-austin-russell-agrees-to-accept-subpoena-in-bankruptcy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">agreed to accept the subpoena last week</a>. Over the weekend, he and Luminar made a joint filing in court laying out the terms of a protective order regarding his personal information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the sale of the lidar assets goes through, it could bring about a fairly swift end to Luminar’s bankruptcy case, which was filed in December. The company has already reached an agreement to sell its other business division, centered around semiconductors, to Quantum Computing Inc. for $110 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with a statement from MicroVision.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It added that the models are good at coding tasks and handling agent swarms <br>—  an orchestration where multiple agents work together. In released benchmarks, the model matches the performance of the proprietary peers and even beats them in certain tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, in the coding benchmark, the Kimi K2.5 outperforms Gemini 3 Pro at the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark and scores higher than GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on the SWE-Bench Multilingual benchmark. In video understanding, it beats GPT 5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 on VideoMMMU (video massive multi-discipline multimodal understanding), a benchmark that measures how a model reasons over videos.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3086508\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg 1022w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=720,433 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=900,541 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=800,481 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=668,401 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=624,375 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=708,425 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-5.08.47-PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Moonshot AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moonshot AI said that on the coding front, while the model can understand text well, users can also feed it images or videos and ask it to make a similar interface shown in those media files. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To let people use these coding capabilities, the company has launched an open source coding tool called Kimi Code, which would rival Anthropic’s Claude Code or Google’s Gemini CLI. Developers can use Kimi Code through their terminals or integrate it with development software such as VSCode, Cursor, and Zed. The startup said that developers can use images and videos as input with Kimi Code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coding tools have gained rapid popularity and are becoming revenue drivers for AI labs. Anthropic announced in November that Claude Code had reached $1 billion in annualized recurring revenue (ARR). Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/claude-code-success-anthropic-business-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wired</a> reported that by the end of 2025, the tool had added $100 million to that figure. Moonshot’s Chinese competitor, DeepSeek, is set to release a new model with strong coding chops next month, according to a report by <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Information</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moonshot was founded by former Google and Meta AI researcher <a href=\"https://kimiyoung.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Yang Zhilin</a>. The company raised $1 billion in funding in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/moonshot-ai-funding-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a Series B round at a $2.5 billion valuation</a>. According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/china-s-moonshot-unveils-new-ai-model-ahead-of-deepseek-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>, the startup picked up $500 million in funding last month at $4.3 billion valuation. What’s more, the report noted that it is already seeking to raise a new round at a $5 billion valuation.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
