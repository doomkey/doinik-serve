To that end, OpenAI has said it has started testing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-rolls-out-ads/\">ads in ChatGPT</a> for free users, a gamble that could lead to more revenue or could send users running from the platform. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apparently investors think it’s worth the risk if they’re valuing the company $20 billion higher than the $830 billion valuation initially expected. The company’s pre-money value will remain at $730 billion, per Bloomberg’s source. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first tranches of funding are reportedly coming from the usual suspects: Amazon (already in talks to invest <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-50-billion-in-openai-wsj-says\">up to $50 billion</a>), SoftBank (gearing up for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-30-billion-more-in-openai-wsj-says\">$30 billion</a>), Nvidia (close to investing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/nvidia-nears-deal-to-invest-20-billion-in-openai-round\">$20 billion</a>), and Microsoft. VC firms and sovereign wealth funds are expected to close later, potentially bringing the total amount raised higher.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment. </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

In doing so, the app could make using RSS feeds to consume news and information a more approachable experience for those who aren’t consuming news for work or consider themselves information junkies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Current’s developer, Terry Godier, said he noticed that he always felt guilty when returning to his feed reader after a few days away. He attributed his feelings to how most readers were built to resemble email inboxes, with unread counts, and bolded text for new items. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Email’s unread count means something specific: these are messages from real people who wrote to you and are, in some cases, actively waiting for your response. The number isn’t neutral information. It’s a measure of social debt,” Godier wrote in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.terrygodier.com/phantom-obligation/ascii\">a blog post</a> about how he came to create Current, which is a side project he worked on during his free time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But when we applied that same visual language to RSS…we imported the anxiety without the cause,” he said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094179\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp 2064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_5_image.webp?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Current</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those unfamiliar, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a>, or Really Simple Syndication, is a format that allows users to access updated information from websites in a structured format. For instance, new headlines and articles from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/feed/\">your favorite news site</a> would appear as new, unread entries in the RSS reader (aka news reader or feed reader) of your choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The format was hugely popular in the early 2000s until the 2006 arrival of Twitter shifted people to another platform for real-time news and information sharing. Within a few years, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/rest-in-peace-rss/\">people were ditching Google’s popular RSS reader,</a> Google Reader, in favor of Twitter’s 140-character posts. Another few years later, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/rip-google-reader/\">Google Reader shut down for good</a>. (We still miss it.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But RSS itself never died. In addition to being the underlying tool for podcast distribution, you can still use the format to syndicate from websites through RSS apps like Feedly, NetNewsWire, Inoreader, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a>, and others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Current, however, proposes a different RSS experience. Instead of structuring feeds as lists to be processed, or unread counts driven to zero, the app’s main screen is a river.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094185\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg 2362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1200,634 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1280,676 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=900,476 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=800,423 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1536,812 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=2048,1082 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=668,353 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1168,617 1168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=708,374 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Screenshot</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Current on the App Store</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re not watching content drift past like a screensaver. It’s a river in the sense that matters: content arrives, lingers for a time, and then fades away,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.terrygodier.com/current\">writes</a> Godier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each piece of content ages differently, with items dimming before fading out entirely and becoming invisible. Breaking news, for instance, remains bright for three hours, while daily news articles may stick around for around 18 hours. Essays sit for longer (three days) and articles like evergreen tutorials remain in the river for a week. As you scroll through the river, you keep up with what’s new and interesting without the pressure of marking things as read.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you set up Current, you pick one of five speeds per source: Breaking, News, Article, Essay, or Tutorial. As you read, you don’t have to physically mark them as read; instead, you just push cards off the screen with a long left swipe, or tap the release button at the end of the article you’ve finished, which brings you back to the river. (There’s also an undo button.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?w=313\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094181\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=244,531 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/imgi_3_image.webp?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Current</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Current also offers a number of other clever features that will thrill RSS enthusiasts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It can fetch the full article text from the web even if the website itself is set to truncate its feeds (as many sites do to motivate people to visit), and you can mark sources as webcomics to unlock an image-first reader experience. You can also mute sources for a week and pin <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/feed/\">those you can’t miss</a> to the top of the river.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app adds some intelligence to your reading experience, too: if a site is flooding your feed, the app will prompt you to quiet or rate-limit them. It also notices when you regularly skip specific content or enthusiastically read it, and will suggest you to either remove feeds you don’t read often or pin those that you do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Current lets you follow individual writers in a space called Voices, which differentiates blogs or newsletters written by individuals from feeds belonging to larger news publications. You can tap on any Voice to filter your feed to focus on just their content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(You can potentially follow individuals within larger publications if their writers have individual RSS feeds. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/sarah-perez/feed/\">Here’s mine</a>!)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094186\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg 1005w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=300,244 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=768,624 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=680,552 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=430,349 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=720,585 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=900,731 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=800,650 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=668,542 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=462,375 462w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=760,617 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=654,531 654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">current</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Godier is interested in identifying voices behind the news, having authored a specification called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bylinespec.org/\">Byline</a> that adds author context to RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Voices” is just one of three built-in categories, which Current simply calls “currents” (hence the app’s name).

This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After this story was published, a Tenga spokesperson told TechCrunch that the breach affected “approximately 600 people” in the United States, based on a forensic review. “We have already proactively contacted those who may have been impacted to ensure their safety and provide guidance,” said the spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company spokesperson would not say if there was any multi-factor on the email account prior to the breach. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo. Tenga sells a variety of sex toys, mostly for men. It’s unclear if the breach affected customers outside of the United States, given that the email came explicitly from Tenga Store USA.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga is the latest in a long list of sex toy makers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/sex-toy-maker-lovense-caught-leaking-users-email-addresses-and-exposing-accounts-to-takeovers/\">such as Lovense last year</a>, and adult websites, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/hacking-group-says-its-extorting-pornhub-after-stealing-users-viewing-data/\">Pornhub</a> last year and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/sexting-site-sextpanther-data-exposed/\">SexPanther</a> in 2020, that have been hacked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>First published on February 13</em>. <em>Updated with comment from Tenga spokesperson.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Email addresses and phone numbers of parents, as well as information about children’s siblings, were also exposed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Florida-based VentureEd Solutions, which develops and maintains Ravenna Hub, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ravennasolutions.com/\">says</a> on its website that it serves over a million students, and processes hundreds of thousands of applications a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch first learned of the vulnerability on Wednesday and soon after alerted the company. VentureEd fixed the bug the same day, but TechCrunch held this report until we could verify that the bug was fixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nick Laird, the chief executive of VentureEd Solutions, told TechCrunch in an email that the company was able to replicate the issue and has addressed the vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laird said the company was investigating the incident, but he would not commit to notifying users about the security lapse, or say — when asked by TechCrunch — if the company has the ability to check if there was any improper access to other users’ data. We also asked if Ravenna Hub had its security checked by a third-party, and if so, by whom. Laird would not say, and declined to comment further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear who, if anyone, oversees cybersecurity at VentureEd and Ravenna Hub.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/cisa-nsa-australia-idor-flaws/\">common security flaw</a> that allows users to access stored information because of weak or non-existent security controls on the concerned servers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, the bug allowed any logged-in user to access another student’s data, including their personal information, by modifying the unique number associated with a student’s profile using their web browser’s address bar. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Ravenna Hub, student numbers are sequential, meaning it was possible for any user to access another student’s data by changing the profile number by one or more digits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch created a new account with test data, we found that the web address contained a seven-digit number. As such, there were slightly more than 1.63 million records prior to ours that were accessible to any other user.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest security lapse involving simple security flaws affecting the personal information of children. In January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/ustrive-security-lapse-exposed-personal-data-of-its-users-including-children/\">online mentoring site UStrive exposed the personal information of its users</a>, many of whom are still in school. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Asare said he came to believe that the future lay in people managing AI employees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “And if that’s true, we’ll need a real system to manage them, with structure around onboarding, coordination, and oversight for digital workers,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, the duo launched <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://withreload.com\">Reload</a>, an AI workforce management platform. On Thursday, the company announced its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://epic.dev/\">first AI product, Epic</a>, alongside a $2.275 million round led by Anthemis, with participation from Zeal Capital Partners, Plug and Play, Cohen Circle, Blueprint, and Axiom. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reload is a platform that lets organizations manage their AI agents across teams and departments. Companies can connect agents, regardless of who built them (whether by a third party or internally), assign them roles and permissions, and track the work they perform. “Reload acts like the system of record for AI employees, providing visibility, coordination, and oversight as agents operate across functions,” said Asare, the company’s CEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, he observed, teams are using multiple agents simultaneously for tasks such as coding, debugging, and refactoring. The problem is that these agents are often focused solely on whatever they were prompted to do and don’t necessarily retain long-term memory of what a product is or why they were told to perform a specific function. They operate, in other words, with only short-term memory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, an agent can lose context, or the system can evolve away from its original intent. That’s why Reload is launching Epic. Built on top of the Reload platform, it serves as an architect alongside other coding agents, continuously defining a product’s requirements and constraints, and reminding agents what they are building and why, to keep a system consistent as it develops. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In software development specifically, coding agents can generate large amounts of code, but they don’t preserve shared system understanding over time,” Asare said. “Epic complements those agents by defining the system upfront and maintaining shared context as it evolves. It doesn’t replace coding agents; it makes them more effective.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epic is designed to live inside the coding environments where developers already work. It can be installed as an extension in AI-assisted code editors like Cursor and Windsurf, running alongside other agents inside these tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When a team starts a project, Epic helps create the core system artifacts such as product requirements, data models, API specifications, tech stack decisions, diagrams, and structured task breakdowns,” Asare said, adding that these are the foundations that coding agents build against. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As development progresses, Epic maintains a structured memory of decisions, code changes, and patterns,” he continued. “If you switch coding agents, your structure and memory follow. If multiple engineers use different agents on the same project, everyone builds against the same shared source of truth.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asare and Das previously had a company together that was acquired and this is their second company together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI infrastructure space is crowded. Competitors include LongChain, which helps with AI agent deployment and memory management, and CrewAI, which helps enterprises manage their AI agents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Das said Epic is different because it “defines the system upfront and maintains shared project-level context across agents and sessions,” with a focus specifically on building infrastructure to maintain AI employees. “Traditional workforce systems weren’t designed for AI agents operating as teammates,” said Das, who serves as the company’s CTO. “That’s the layer we’re focused on.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh capital will go toward hiring and product advancement, specifically expanding the infrastructure needed to support a growing number of AI agents. “We’re building for the next era of work,” Asare said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to add the other investors in the round. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rivian owners will be able to perform basic tasks such as locking and unlocking doors, venting windows, and triggering the vehicle alarm using their Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian said it is adding more precise and customizable functions, too. For instance, users can adjust the digital crown on the watch to set a target state of charge or adjust the temperature inside the vehicle. The app also allows users to pick four quick controls, depending on which they use the most.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some limitations, however, for Rivian’s first-generation R1T trucks and R1S SUVs. Owners of these cars will only be able to lock or unlock their vehicle by opening the app and tapping the lock icon on the Watch. Second-generation R1 vehicles, meanwhile, will unlock automatically as the driver approaches the car, provided a digital key has been set up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Apple Watch integration follows a broader update to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/techcrunch-mobility-rivians-savior/\">vehicle software system</a> that was rolled out on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most of the updates focus on improving performance and accessibility, including a “kneel mode” that lowers the vehicle another inch below its previous low setting. The update will also allow drivers to toggle between different drive modes without causing the advanced driver assistance system to disengage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a new cold weather indicator that will add a blue tint to the battery graphic displayed on the vehicle’s digital screen so drivers can see how much energy the battery pack is used for warming.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian makes and sells EVs, but software has become one of its central products, and a selling point, for consumers as well as companies like Volkswagen that have tapped the carmaker for its technology.

Companies like Apple and Qualcomm are in the early stages of making on-device AI more useful. Amid all that, the 14-person technical team of London-based <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://trymirai.com/\">Mirai</a> is working to improve how models run on phones and laptops.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai, which is backed by a $10 million seed round led by Uncork Capital, was founded by Dima Shvets and Alexey Moiseenkov last year. Both founders have experience in building scalable consumer apps. Shevts co-founded face-swapping app Reface, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/reface-grabs-5-5m-seed-led-by-a16z-to-stoke-its-viral-face-swap-video-app/\">which was backed by a16z</a>. Shvets later also became a scout for the venture firm. Moiseenkov was CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/prisma-uses-ai-to-turn-your-photos-into-graphic-novel-fodder-double-quick/\">the last decade’s viral AI filters app, Prisma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As consumer developers, both had been thinking about AI and machine learning on devices even before generative AI became popular, Shvets said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we met together in London, we started to chat about technology, and we realized that within the hype of gen AI and more AI adoption, everybody speaks about cloud, about servers, about AGI coming. But the missing piece is on-device [AI] for consumer hardware,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shvets and Moiseenkov wanted to use AI to create a pipeline that would allow them to enable complex tasks on the phone, which led them to start Mirai. When they asked others who developed consumer apps, they heard that many wanted better cost optimization and margin per token usage, too.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094301\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=430,254 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=720,426 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=900,533 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=800,473 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=668,395 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=634,375 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=1043,617 1043w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=708,419 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Co-founders Alexey Moiseenkov and Dima Shvets Image Credits: Mirai</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Mirai is developing a framework for models so they can perform better on devices. The company has built an inference engine for Apple Silicon that optimizes on-device throughput. With its upcoming SDK, developers can integrate the runtime in their apps with only a few lines, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the visions why we started the company was that we wanted to give developers, like this Stripe-like, eight lines of code [integration] experience…you basically go to our platform, integrate the key, and start working with summarization, classification, or whatever your use case is,” Shvets said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built this engine in Rust, which can bump up a model’s generation speed by up to 37%, they claim. The company said that, while tuning the model for a platform, it doesn’t tinker with model weights to ensure there is no loss in quality of the output.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai’s stack currently focuses on improving text and voice modalities on the platform, with plans to support vision in the future. The team has started to work with frontier model providers to tune their models for edge use and is in talks with different chipmakers. Later, it plans to bring its engine to Android, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Mirai aims to release on-device benchmarks so model makers can test on-device performance. Shevts recognizes that not all AI work can be done on-device, though. To enable a mixed mode of operation, the team is building an orchestration layer to send requests that can’t be fulfilled on the device up to the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the startup is not directly working with apps just yet, its engine could power on-device assistants, transcribers, translators, and chat apps, we’re told.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andy McLoughlin, managing partner at Uncork Capital, noted that he invested in an edge machine learning company in the last decade. He said that the company was early and eventually sold its business to Spotify. In today’s world, the situation is different, he thinks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given the cost of cloud inference, something has to change… For now, VCs are happy to continue funding the rocketship companies, spending inordinate sums on cloud inference. But that won’t last — at some point, people will focus on the underlying economics of these businesses and realize that something has to change,” he said. “It feels like every model maker will want to run part of their inference workloads at the edge, and Mirai feels very well positioned to capture this demand.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai’s seed round also saw participation from individuals, including Dreamer CEO David Singleton, YC Partner Francois Chaubard, Snowflake co-founder Marcin Żukowski, ElevenLabs co-founder Mati Staniszewski, former Google AdSense product manager and Coinbase board member Gokul Rajaram, Groq investor Scooter Braun, Turing.com CTO Vijay Krishnan, Theory Forge Ventures’ Ben Parr and Matt Schlicht, and ex-Netflix technical leader, Aditya Jami.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He took a few stabs at starting new AI businesses, but nothing really stuck until he got a call from a friend who wanted help filling out customs paperwork.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu got “very curious” and started cold-calling customs brokers in the Los Angeles area. He learned that many are mom-and-pop affairs still deeply reliant on fax machines and paper. When his first customer showed him stacks of manila folders during a FaceTime tour of her office, everything clicked, Basu told TechCrunch. He flew to that customer’s office the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That was the eye-opening moment. There’s just papers and papers,” Basu said in a recent interview. “I was both shocked and impressed. Shocked that this is how the industry runs, and impressed that everything around us, from the watch that you’re wearing to the glasses, literally everything that’s imported, and this is what’s happening behind the scenes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This seed of an idea is now called Amari AI, a startup co-founded by Basu and Arushi Vashist, a former senior software engineer at LinkedIn. The pair, and their small team, have already collected more than 30 customers, and helped those firms move more than $15 billion of goods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amari has also raised $4.5 million of funding co-led by preeminent early-stage firms First Round Capital and Pear VC, all before coming out of stealth mode on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu has two goals with Amari. One is to help customs brokers modernize. To date, he said, many of them have done little work to integrate new technologies. Some leverage optical character recognition software to help speed up data entry, but that tech is limited and brittle, he said. Amari is meant to help automate data entry and paperwork, and let employees — who <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Oct/CBP%20Publication%201847-0622%20-%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Key%20Changes%2019%20CFR%20111%20Final%20Rule.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legally must be in the United States</a>, meaning companies can’t use off-shore workers — focus on helping customers move their goods across the border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where the second goal comes in. President Donald Trump’s chaotic trade policy has made customs brokers all the more important, according to Chris Bachinski, CEO of 125-year-old firm GHY International. Bachinski — who is one of Amari’s early adopters — told TechCrunch that many of his own customers don’t even have their own compliance staff. Instead, they look to the brokers like GHY to help figure out how sudden changes in trade policy apply to their goods, especially if they are already in transit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This chaos has led to burnout across the industry, according to Basu. With the employee base tightly regulated, and a <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/customs-brokers/license-examination-notice-examination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">licensing exam pass rate</a> that hovers around 10% to 20%, “it’s a perfect fit for AI,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Experienced people are leaving the industry or taking early retirement,” Basu said. “So we’re pitching ourselves as these extra set of hands that logistics companies can hire or keep alongside the human expertise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu said Amari’s AI agents constantly monitor trade rules and update their reasoning any time there’s a change, making it easier for brokers to help their customers quickly understand any impact. Previously, these kinds of sudden changes required manual research that would slow down brokers’ ability to clear cargo into the country.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amari does this by building its own AI models trained on more than one million documents related to the shipments it’s already helped clear through customs, though Basu said the company has been leveraging off-the-shelf models to date. He noted some customers do opt out of this training, and that Amari anonymizes the data before feeding it to the models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do not sell their data, and we make sure that their data is theirs,” he said. “They’re very serious about these documents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Todd Jackson, a partner at First Round Capital, attributed Amari’s early success to Basu’s willingness to pound the pavement in order to learn what these brokers need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He’s going to conferences, he’s going to trade shows, [and] the word of mouth starts to get very strong,” Jackson said in an interview. “It’s an old-school industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was at one of these trade shows — the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, to be precise — that one of Basu’s presentations caught Bachinski’s eye. GHY International is not a mom-and-pop, but it’s also not a Fortune 500 like FedEx; Bachinski has been looking for ways to both stay competitive and grow his company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bachinski said the biggest concern amongst GHY employees so far has been job loss. But he’s told them not to worry. He said he expects tech like Amari’s to help GHY grow, and to focus more on the customer relationships and compliance work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s an old industry, and technology is going to shift our industry faster than I think most customs brokers understand,” he said. And with trade now constantly in the spotlight, he said brokers need to be agile. “I make this joke that last year, the first time in history, our families know what we do for a living. Because all of a sudden, custom brokers became very, very important.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But that equation just doesn’t quite stick. In practice, the impact of AI coding tools on open source software has been far more mixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools have caused as many problems as they have solved, according to industry experts. The easy-to-use and accessible nature of AI coding tools has enabled a flood of bad code that threatens to overwhelm projects. Building new features is easier than ever, but maintaining them is just as hard and threatens to further fragment software ecosystems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is a more complicated story than simple software abundance. Perhaps, the predicted, imminent death of the software engineer in this new AI era is premature. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-quality-vs-quantity\">Quality vs quantity</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across the board, projects with open codebases are noticing a decline in the average quality of submissions, likely a result of AI tools lowering barriers to entry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For people who are junior to the VLC codebase, the quality of the merge requests we see is abysmal,” Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.videolan.org/\">the VideoLan Organization</a> that oversees VLC, said in a recent interview.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kempf is still optimistic about AI coding tools overall but says they’re best “for experienced developers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been similar problems for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/\">Blender</a>, a 3D modeling tool that has been maintained as open source since 2002. Blender Foundation CEO Franceso Siddi said LLM-assisted contributions typically “wasted reviewers’ time and affected their motivation.” Blender is still developing an official policy for AI coding tools, but Siddi said they are “neither mandated nor recommended for contributors or core developers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flood of merge requests has gotten so bad that open-source developers are building new tools to manage it. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, developer Mitchell Hashimoto launched a system that would limit GitHub contributions to “vouched” users, effectively closing the open-door policy for open-source software. As Hashimoto put it in the announcement, “AI eliminated the natural barrier to entry that let OSS projects trust by default.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same effect has emerged in bug bounty programs, which give outside researchers an open door to report security vulnerabilities. The open-source data transfer program cURL recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thenewstack.io/curls-daniel-stenberg-ai-is-ddosing-open-source-and-fixing-its-bugs/\">halted its bug bounty program</a> after being overwhelmed by what creator Daniel Stenberg described as “AI slop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the old days, someone actually invested a lot of time [in] the security report,” Stenberg said at a recent conference. “There was a built-in friction, but now there’s no effort at all in doing this. The floodgates are open.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s particularly frustrating because many of open-source projects are also seeing the benefits of AI coding tools. Kempf says it’s made building new modules for VLC far easier, provided there’s an experienced developer at the helm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can give the model the whole codebase of VLC and say, ‘I’m porting this to a new operating system,’” Kempf said. “It is useful for senior people to write new code, but it’s difficult to manage for people who don’t know what they’re doing.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-competing-priorities\">Competing priorities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger problem for open-source projects is a difference in priorities. Companies like Meta value new code and products, while open-source software work focuses more on stability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The problem is different from large companies to open-source projects,” Kempf commented. “They get promoted for writing code, not maintaining it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools are also arriving at a moment when software, in general, is particularly fragmented. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Open source investor Konstantin Vinogradov says AI tools are running into a long-standing trend in open-source engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On the one hand, we have exponentially growing code base with exponentially growing number of interdependences, And on the other hand, we have number of active maintainers, which is maybe slowly growing, but definitely not keeping up,” Vinogradov said. “With AI, both parts of this equation accelerated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a new way of thinking about AI’s impact on software engineering — one with alarming implications for the industry at large. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you see engineering as the process of producing working software, AI coding makes it easier than ever. But if engineering is really the process of managing software complexity, AI coding tools could make it harder. At the very least, it will take a lot of active planning and work to keep the sprawling complexity in check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Vinogradov, the result is a familiar situation for open-source projects: a lot of work to do, and not enough good engineers to do it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI does not increase the number of active, skilled maintainers,” he remarked. “It empowers the good ones, but all the fundamental problems just remain.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

FreeForm declined to disclose the company’s post-financing valuation, which Pitchbook cites as $179 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO and cofounder Erik Palitsch said the funding would allow the company to upgrade its current GoldenEye printing system, which uses 18 lasers to fuse metal powders into precision components, to a new version. Dubbed Skyfall, the next iteration of the platform would use hundreds of lasers to produce thousands of kilograms of metal parts each day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the culmination of a vision Palitsch and co-founder/president Thomas Ronacher launched in 2018. The two met while developing rocket engines at SpaceX, where they found that industrial machines for printing metal components are expensive, finicky, and not well designed for mass manufacturing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their new company would build its platform from the ground up to achieve higher throughput and flexibility, with an emphasis on active software controls. Palitsch says Freeform’s platform is “AI native,” noting a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/ex-spacex-engineers-land-14m-to-scale-new-method-for-3d-printing-metal/\">partnership with Nvidia</a> that allows the company to access advanced GPUs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’re the only quote-unquote manufacturing company out there that has H200 clusters in a data center on site,” Paltisch told TechCrunch. “What are they doing?

The first five to 10 employees will have a massive impact on the company culture, and the precedents set with them are difficult to change down the road. That’s why this season on Build Mode, we’re diving into what it takes to build a world-class founding team.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To kick off season two, Isabelle Johannessen is joined by Yuri Sagalov, managing director at General Catalyst and former founder, YC partner, and seed investor at Wayfinder Ventures. Sagalov has worked with hundreds of pre-seed and seed-stage companies and has seen firsthand the best (and worst) ways to hire in the early days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this episode, Sagalov offers his best pieces of advice for founders who are hiring their first team, strategically building their cap table, and forming compensation structures that can scale with the company.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-three-types-of-investors-and-which-one-to-avoid\">The three types of investors (and which one to avoid) </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagalov categorizes investors into three main buckets: the ones that are heavily involved and function as an extension of your team, the ones that will give you a check and then vanish, and the micromanagers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first type of investor is the most valuable according to Sagalov: “They’re going to help you with recruiting, hiring, go to market. And the most interesting thing with those investors is often it’s completely disconnected from the check size.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it may feel counterintuitive to turn down investments, working with VCs who will become overly involved in the process may cause more harm than good in the long run. Sagalov said, “The only bucket that I avoid is this third bucket of investors who give you money and they’re kind of in your kitchen, meddling. They have an opinion on everything. They get stressed out when things don’t go right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a fundraise, everyone is putting their best foot forward, so Sagalov suggests reaching out to current portfolio companies before committing to an investor.  “The best thing you can do as a founder is actually talk to portfolio companies, talk to other founders that they’ve worked with, ask for concrete examples of how they’ve been helpful, if they’ve been helpful, and then actually ask how they were when things didn’t go right.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-split-equity-with-a-co-founder\">How to split equity with a co-founder </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an investor, Sagalov looks for co-founders who have created an equity split that is fair but also hedges for future misalignments. He suggests creating a slight differentiation by plus or minus one share so there is a clear way to break deadlocks.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagalov also reminds early-stage founders that these early decisions have staying power: “Oftentimes founders over-index on ‘I came up with the idea, so I deserve the lion’s share.’  Most of the journey of the company is ahead of them. You don’t want someone waking up five years from now feeling like they put in equal blood, sweat, and tears but own one-fifth of the equity.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talk-to-early-employees-about-risk-and-compensation\">Talk to early employees about risk and compensation </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first few hires should be all in on the startup’s mission. Oftentimes, joining an early-stage startup can be perceived as risky. Sagalov emphasized the importance of discussing the risks and potential benefits: “Fundamentally, what you’re looking for when you’re hiring the first few people are missionaries who, beyond even the compensation, want to join you for the mission of the business,” he said. “You want to be honest with them that there is a lot of risk on the journey.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next week on Build Mode, we’re talking with Sarah Lucena, the founder and CEO of Mappa, who discusses how founders can take compatibility into account and hire the right fit for the team the first time, using their AI tool. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Isabelle Johannessen is our host.

The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/openai-for-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/openais-stargate-project-sets-its-sights-on-international-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stargate project</a>, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users</a> spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI’s Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI’s partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country’s workforce for the AI era.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2025, TCS <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/indias-tcs-gets-tpg-to-fund-half-of-2b-ai-data-center-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">secured backing from private equity firm TPG</a> to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business. The platform is backed by about ₹180 billion (about $2 billion) in planned investment and is designed to support large-scale compute workloads for hyperscalers and enterprise customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI will also expand its certification programs in India, with TCS becoming the first participating organization outside the United States. The certifications are designed to help professionals build practical AI skills across roles and industries, the company said. The move follows OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent partnerships with leading Indian institutions</a> in engineering, medicine, and design.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI plans to open new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">existing presence in New Delhi</a> as it deepens operations in the country.

Earlier this week, OpenAI partnered with leading Indian engineering, medical, and design institutions to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bring AI tools into higher education</a>, betting that India’s large developer base and more than a billion internet users will play a central role in the next phase of AI adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs is already using AI internally to automate parts of its settlement and reconciliation process, cutting the time it takes to clear daily settlements from hours to minutes, according to Chief executive B Amrish Rau. The Noida-based company previously relied on manual checks by dozens of employees to process funds from multiple banks before markets opened each day, a workflow that is now largely handled by AI-driven systems, he said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Pine Labs, the partnership is intended to extend those AI-driven efficiencies beyond internal operations to merchants and corporate clients, starting with business-to-business use cases such as invoice processing, settlements and payments orchestration, Rau told TechCrunch. He noted the company sees faster adoption in B2B workflows, where AI agents can handle large volumes of repetitive financial tasks under predefined rules, before similar capabilities reach consumer-facing payments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People talk about retail AI, but the bigger impact of all of this is really efficiency improvement, especially in B2B,” Rau said. “If you look at invoicing and settlement, those are workflows where agents can actually drive the process end to end, and that’s where adoption can happen faster.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rollout of more autonomous, agent-led payment workflows will move faster in overseas markets where regulations already allow such transactions, Rau said, while India is likely to see a more gradual adoption focused on AI-assisted commerce rather than fully agent-initiated payments. He said that Pine Labs is already prototyping agent-driven payments in parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, even as Indian regulations require tighter controls on how payments are authorized.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For OpenAI, the partnership offers a route deeper into India’s payments and enterprise ecosystem as it looks to move beyond consumer-facing tools and embed its models into high-volume, regulated workflows. Rau said the collaboration is aimed at increasing merchant stickiness and expanding Pine Labs’ role from a payments processor to a broader commerce platform, with higher transaction volumes over time translating into incremental revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs says it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/pine-labs-aims-to-take-indian-fintech-global-even-as-it-cuts-valuation-for-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">works with more than 980,000 merchants</a>, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, and has processed over 6 billion cumulative transactions valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (about $126 billion), per its prospectus published last year. The fintech operates across 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, parts of Africa, the UAE, and the U.S., giving the OpenAI partnership reach across both Indian and international markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rau said the partnership does not involve revenue sharing between the two companies, with Pine Labs not taking a cut if its merchants choose to embed OpenAI’s tools. “We’ve kept it completely independent of each other — anything related to payment and payment services, we will get the benefit of it, and anything related to OpenAI revenues will go to them,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The arrangement, Rau added, is also non-exclusive. He compared it to OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe in the U.S. and said Pine Labs remains open to working with other AI providers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rau said Pine Labs is building additional security and compliance layers around AI-driven workflows to ensure that sensitive merchant and consumer transaction data remains protected, as the company integrates AI more deeply into its payments systems. He said the focus is on ensuring transactions remain secure and compliant even as more workflows are automated by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pine Labs’ interest in AI-driven commerce builds on earlier work through its Setu unit, which has <a href=\"https://www.pinelabs.com/media-analyst/setu-launches-indias-first-agentic-bill-payments-experience-on-chatgpt-and-claude\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">experimented with agent-led bill payment experiences</a> using chatbots including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude.

Etsy is scheduled to release its 2025 earnings on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers,” said Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal in the press release. “We are proud of what the Depop team has built – a truly differentiated brand and product, grounded in clear purpose and strong community – becoming one of the fastest-growing fashion resale marketplaces in the U.S. I am confident that Depop is well-positioned for its next phase of growth as part of eBay.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sale is the latest in a pattern of Etsy acquiring and then divesting niche online marketplaces.

class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Germ’s standalone app is also available in a public beta on iOS in North America and Europe. That app had seen thousands of downloads so far, but after the official integration announcement, daily active users jumped by 5x, the team said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">California-based Germ is a startup founded by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tessa-r-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tessa Brown</a>, a communications scholar who previously taught at Stanford, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmxue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mark Xue</a>, who worked as a privacy engineer at Apple on technologies like FaceTime and iMessage. The idea, the company previously explained to TechCrunch, was to offer an alternative to other E2E encrypted platforms like iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp that’s built on newer technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Germ takes advantage of Messaging Layer Security (MLS), a new standard approved by the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF), and the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol</a> (or ATProto), which powers Bluesky, Skylight, and a growing number of other social apps. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of requiring a user’s phone number, Germ integrates with ATProto to enable its encrypted chats. That means Germ’s messages cannot be decrypted by another service, including itself or Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the new messenger, you’ll simply click on the badge on a friend’s profile on Bluesky, which opens an iOS App Clip — a lightweight, temporary app. You click “open” on this app experience and then authenticate by logging in with your ATProto handle. You can then send a message to a friend immediately. You’ll also be nudged to download the full Germ DM app, but this is optional. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you want to add the badge to your own profile, you’ll download the Germ DM app on iOS and authenticate your Bluesky credentials there.

Now, users who set up Germ to work within Bluesky will receive a new badge that’s displayed on their profiles, allowing them to remove the link-in-bio option they were using before. (The links will still work, but the badge is easier and more noticeable, of course.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Germ told TechCrunch their startup has been in conversation with the ATProto developer community, including Bluesky’s app and protocol teams, since the <a href=\"https://atprotocol.dev/atmosphereconf-seattle-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ATmosphere Conference in Seattle</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve been transparent about our planning and roadmap, and shipping our private beta in August generated valuable feedback from users and developers about the desire to replace our links in bios with native UI,” said Xue, who serves as CTO at Germ Network. “Both our team and Bluesky’s saw value in better AppView support for the Germ link.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes to Bluesky’s app were led by head of product Alex Benzer, as the company was <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/protocol-checkin-fall-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">looked to experiment</a> with implementing third-party services within Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Working directly with the Bluesky team has been a treat,” Brown, Germ’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “They ship fast, prioritize the user experience, and care about their users’ access to end-to-end encrypted messaging. We’re thrilled to be the first secure messenger they’ve brought natively into their app.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s true that the AT Protocol could eventually implement E2E encryption, that is not a focus today. As Bluesky protocol engineer Daniel Holms recently explained, the company has several reasons not to design a system itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reality is that E2EE is hard,” he <a href=\"https://dholms.leaflet.pub/3meluqcwky22a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a blog post</a>. “And this inherent complexity isn’t something that the protocol team at Bluesky can just handle – it gets pushed out to every dev trying to build a client that works with encrypted data,” Holms said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xue agreed, adding, “We align with the ATProto ethos that people should be able to communicate using the apps and tools they choose. We believe that by solving the hard problems for ATProto users in safe, transparent, and user-friendly ways, they’ll continue to choose us,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after Bluesky added support for the Germ badge, another <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/blackskyweb.xyz/post/3meoxfu7ap22m\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol-based client, Blacksky</a>, did as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown noted the team is currently focused on shipping more everyday messaging features, not on monetization. But further down the road, Germ may test paid features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect that our first paid features will be centered on the needs of prosumer power users like creators, journalists, and politicians—for example, support for multiple handles and private AI-powered screening for first messages from new connections,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
