The company raised $13 billion in equity funding <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation\">just five months ago</a>, but intense competition between frontier labs and the ongoing cost of compute have made them eager to raise as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Funds expected to participate in the round include Altimeter Capital Management, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Coatue Management, Iconiq Capital, and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, but the bulk of the funding is said to come from the company’s strategic partners Nvidia and Microsoft.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is building on recent successes, most notably the deployment of its coding agents, which have software engineers raving about increased coding productivity. Last week, the company’s release of new models focused on legal and business research rattled the share prices of publicly-traded data firms as investors worried about the ability of AI to disrupt their businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s rival, OpenAI, is reportedly assembling a new $100 billion fundraising round, and both companies are thought to be preparing IPOs ahead of a blockbuster summer in the markets, with xAI, recently acquired by SpaceX, also tapping public equity as part of the rocket maker’s IPO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iconik.io/blog/what-is-dark-data-and-why-you-should-care\">dark data</a>: a massive, untapped resource that companies collect automatically but almost never use in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To tackle the problem, Aza Kai (CEO) and Hiraku Yanagita (COO), two former Googlers who spent nearly a decade working together at Google Japan, decided to build their own solution. The duo co-founded <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://infinimind.io/en\">InfiniMind</a>, a Tokyo-based startup developing infrastructure that converts petabytes of unviewed video and audio into structured, queryable business data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My co-founder, who spent a decade leading brand and data solutions at Google Japan, and I saw this inflection point coming while we were still at Google,” Kai said. By 2024, the technology had matured, and the market demand had become clear enough that the co-founders felt compelled to build the company themselves, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kai, who previously worked at Google Japan across cloud, machine learning, ad systems, and video recommendation models and later led data science teams, explained that current solutions force a tradeoff. Earlier approaches could label objects in individual frames, but they couldn’t track narratives, understand causality, or answer complex questions about video content. For clients with decades of broadcast archives and petabytes of footage, even basic questions about their content often went unanswered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What really changed was the progress in vision-language models between 2021 and 2023. That’s when video AI started moving beyond simple object tagging, Kai noted. Falling GPU costs and annual performance gains of roughly 15–20% over the last decade helped, but the bigger story was capability until recently, models just couldn’t do the job, he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">InfiniMind recently secured $5.8 million in seed funding, led by UTEC and joined by CX2, Headline Asia, Chiba Dojo, and an AI researcher at a16z Scout<strong>.</strong> The company is relocating its headquarters to the U.S., while it continues to operate an office in Japan. Japan provided the perfect testbed: strong hardware, talented engineers, and a supportive startup ecosystem<strong>, </strong>allowing the team to fine-tune its technology with demanding customers before going global.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its first product, TV Pulse, launched in Japan in April 2025. The AI-powered platform analyzes television content in real time, helping media and retail companies “track product exposure, brand presence, customer sentiment, and PR impact,” per the startup. After pilot programs with major broadcasters and agencies, it already has paying customers, including wholesalers and media companies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, InfiniMind is ready for the international market. Its flagship product, DeepFrame, a long-form video intelligence platform capable of processing 200 hours of footage to pinpoint specific scenes, speakers, or events, is scheduled for a beta release in March, followed by a full launch in April 2026, Kai said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090794\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">image credits: infinimind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The video analysis space is highly fragmented. Companies such as TwelveLabs provide general-purpose video understanding APIs for a broad range of users, including consumers, prosumers, and enterprises, Kai said, while InfiniMind focuses specifically on enterprise use cases, including monitoring, safety, security, and analyzing video content for deeper insights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our solution requires no code; clients bring their data, and our system processes it, providing actionable insights,” Kai said. “We also integrate audio, sound, and speech understanding, not just visuals. Our system can handle unlimited video length, and cost efficiency is a major differentiator. Most existing solutions prioritize accuracy or specific use cases but don’t solve cost challenges.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed funding will help the team continue developing the DeepFrame model, expand engineering infrastructure, hire more engineers, and reach additional customers across Japan and the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is an exciting space, one of the paths toward AGI,” Kai said. “Understanding general video intelligence is about understanding reality. Industrial applications are important, but our ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of technology to better understand reality and help humans make better decisions.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s worth noting that location sharing on Snap Map is off by default. No one can see your location or receive an alert unless you choose to share it, Snapchat explained. One-time alerts expire after they’re sent or after 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use Arrival Notifications, you need to share your location with a trusted friend that you want to keep in the loop. Then, you need to tap on your friendship profile and scroll down to “Arrival Notifications.” You can pick a location on the map and give it a personal name. For example, you could set the location for your “run club” or the location for “piano lessons.” You can then choose a one-time or recurring alert, after which Snapchat will notify your friend when you arrive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature comes as Snapchat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/snap-map-reaches-new-milestone-of-400m-monthly-active-users/\">announced last summer that Snap Map</a> now has more than 400 million monthly active users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. The feature now also offers ways for users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/03/snapchat-restaurant-recommendations-snap-map/\">discover local hotspots</a> and find things to do.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its Home Safe and Arrival Notifications features, Snapchat is looking to further compete with services like the family location-sharing app Life360 and Apple’s “Find My.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Over the past few years, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\">dozens of stalkerware apps</a> have been hacked, or have managed to lose, spill, or expose people’s private data — often the victims themselves — thanks to shoddy cybersecurity by the stalkerware operators.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tTo contact Zack Whittaker securely, reach out via Signal username zackwhittaker.1337.

The customer records did not include dates of payments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch verified the data was authentic by taking several transaction records containing disposable email addresses with public inboxes, such as Mailinator, and running them through the various password reset portals provided by the various surveillance apps. By resetting the passwords on accounts associated with public email addresses, we determined that these were real accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We also verified the data by matching each transaction’s unique invoice number from the leaked dataset with the surveillance vendor’s checkout pages. We could do this because the checkout page allowed us to retrieve the same customer and transaction data from the server without needing a password.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacktivist, who goes by the moniker “wikkid,” told TechCrunch they scraped the data from the stalkerware vendor thanks to a “trivial” bug in its website. The hacktivist said they “have fun targeting apps that are used to spy on people,” and subsequently published the scraped data on a known hacking forum.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacking forum listing lists the surveillance vendor as Ersten Group, which presents itself as a U.K.-presenting software development startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch found several email addresses in the dataset used for testing and customer support instead reference Struktura, a Ukrainian company that has an identical website to Ersten Group. The earliest record in the dataset contained the email address for Struktura’s chief executive, Viktoriia Zosim, for a transaction of $1. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Representatives for Ersten Group did not respond to our requests for comment.

The new plans will start rolling out this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While that main plan will not go away, the new plans will allow customers to pick what matters most and what they could do without in return for cost savings. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090976\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg 1302w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=1200,868 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=1280,926 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=430,311 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=720,521 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=900,651 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=800,579 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=668,483 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=518,375 518w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=853,617 853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=708,512 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>YouTube</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among the new plans are a $64.99 per month Sports plan, a Sports + News plan for $71.99 per month, a less expensive Entertainment plan for $54.99 per month, and a $69.99 per month News + Entertainment + Family plan, which includes kids’ content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Sports plans include all major broadcasters, plus networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, all of the ESPN networks, and ESPN Unlimited. This plan is $18 cheaper per month than the main plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube TV’s news channels include CNBC, Fox News, CNN, MS NOW, and Bloomberg, along with other national news channels. Combined with Sports, the package is priced $11 lower per month than the main YouTube TV plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entertainment-only plan is $28 cheaper per month than the main plan, and includes major broadcasters as well as FX, Hallmark, Comedy Central, Bravo, Paramount, Food Network, and HGTV. Families with small kids can add other channels like Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Cartoon Network, and PBS Kids for a bit more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also offering discounts for new subscribers, which could lower the price of certain plans further for either the first few months or the first year. Subscribers will continue to have access to YouTube TV’s unlimited DVR, support for up to six family members on one account, multiview, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other add-ons like NFL Sunday Ticket + RedZone, HBO Max, and 4K Plus can also be purchased to customize plans further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says all the new plans will roll out over the next several weeks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customized packages are now not a new idea in streaming — à la carte options were a key part of the early streaming pioneer Sling TV’s initial offering, for instance. This element of personalization was also one of the factors that was meant to make streaming a better alternative to traditional pay TV, where consumers often ended up paying for channels they didn’t want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as streamers added more content, networks, and, in particular, sports programming, the cost of streaming inched back up to compete with cable and linear television. Live TV streamers like YouTube TV may have offered convenience and some savings over still <a href=\"https://cordcuttersnews.com/average-cost-of-cable-tv-climbs-to-over-over-147-a-month-over-1700-a-year-as-cord-cutting-grows/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more expensive cable</a>, but it wasn’t exactly affordable anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These new packages hit the market at a time when consumer confidence is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-confidence-slumps-january-level-last-seen-2014-2026-01-27/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">at its lowest in more than 11 years,</a> due to fears about the labor market and higher prices, which have made consumers more cautious about their spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

All users will be put into a “teen-appropriate experience” by default unless they prove they’re adults. Age verification will be required to change certain settings and access age-restricted content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord users will need to be confirmed as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting, and only adults can access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands. Additionally, messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and only verified adults can modify this setting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know, and only adults will be able speak onstage in servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To complete age verification, users need to either complete a facial age estimation or submit an ID to Discord’s vendor partners. The platform plans to add more options in the future. Discord notes that some users may be asked to use multiple methods when additional information is needed to assign an age group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The facial age estimation requires video selfies, which Discord says never leave your device. Additionally, the company says IDs submitted to its vendor partners are deleted quickly and, in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Discord <a href=\"https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service?ref=404media.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a> last October that around 70,000 users may have had sensitive data, such as their government ID photos, exposed after hackers breached a third-party vendor that the platform uses for age-related appeals. The breach reflected <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/eff-fifth-circuit-age-verification-laws-will-hurt-more-they-help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">digital rights activists’ concerns</a> over the use of age checks as a way to make the internet “safer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord’s global launch of age verification follows the company’s decision to <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/33362401287959-What-s-Changing-for-UK-and-Australian-Users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">establish age checks</a> for users in the U.K. and Australia last year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility,” said Savannah Badalich, head of product policy at Discord, in a press release. “We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement mirrors similar moves made by other online platforms, reflecting growing international efforts to strengthen child safety. Most recently, Roblox introduced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/roblox-now-requires-all-users-globally-to-complete-age-checks-to-access-chat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mandatory facial verification</a> for access to chats on its platform. Last July, YouTube <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/youtube-rolls-out-age-estimatation-tech-to-identify-u-s-teens-and-apply-additional-protections/\">launched its age-estimation</a> technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in order to provide a more age-appropriate experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord’s age-verification changes will begin in early March, and both new and existing users will need to verify their age to access age-restricted content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The ride-hailing giant will also pay $100 million for a 15% stake in Getir’s grocery, retail, and water delivery business, and said it would complete the acquisition of the division over the next few years.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber is buying the business from Getir’s biggest shareholder, the Emirati sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The investment firm was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/mubadala-explores-selling-all-getir-stakes-turkey-sources-say-2025-09-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> seeking to sell its stake in the company last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal comes after a turbulent few years for Getir, which once enjoyed a valuation of $12 billion, that saw the startup scale down its operations massively. The company launched to great traction in 2015, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/\">invested aggressively</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/getir-weezy-acquisition/\">expand</a> its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/07/getir-freshdirect/\">operations</a> in the U.S. and Europe, both organically and via acquisitions, especially during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But after the pandemic lockdowns eased, broader consumer demand for food and grocery delivery also wavered, and Getir chose to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/getir-getout-instant-delivery/\">cut its losses</a> in 2024, shutting shop and laying off thousands of staff in the U.S., U.K., and Europe in order to focus on business back home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nearly a year ago, the company went through a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/mubadala-proposal-turkeys-getir-prompts-founders-plan-legal-move-2025-01-15/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">struggle for control</a> over a restructuring plan proposed by Mubadala. The plan was opposed by one of Getir’s co-founders, who eventually sued to fight the “illegal coup,” but a Dutch court rejected the founder’s appeals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised a total of $2.40 billion so far, according to PitchBook.

Uber said Getir’s food delivery business alone recorded gross bookings of more than $1 billion in 2025, up 50% from a year earlier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal follows a strong showing by Uber’s delivery business in the fourth quarter, <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/fcda6930-c9b5-4ab5-bb64-9b621c2ca8a5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting</a> revenue of $4.89 billion, up 30% from a year earlier.

That’s the VC firm founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Gather team first met Smith Point a year ago at a logistics conference, and “it took Keith and his team five minutes to get what we’re doing,” co-founder and CEO Sankalp Arora told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What <a href=\"https://www.gather.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gather AI</a> is doing is unusual. The three founders met as PhD students at Carnegie Mellon University, where they built one of the first autonomous helicopters and tested it on the FBI training grounds in Quantico. (Block is a trustee for CMU.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2017, the founders took what they learned about teaching helicopters to fly and land safely and launched Gather AI. Using off-the-shelf cameras placed on strategic moving equipment like forklifts, as well as off-the-shelf drones flying around the warehouse, the cameras watch on-the-floor operations and log what they find into the warehouse management systems.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the catch is, the AI isn’t being random about what it scans. It is being “curious,” as Arora described it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My PhD work focused on how to make different kinds of flying robots curious,” he said. “So they’re curious about boxes and bar codes and workflows.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to barcodes, they look for lot codes, text, expiration dates, case counts, damages, occupancy, and other items. The idea is that they will discover and predict issues like low inventory, misplaced stock, and workflows that may cause safety issues. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also work in environments unfriendly to people, like freezers and cold storage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because Gather’s underlying tech was built years before the age of large language models, this is not the kind of AI that an LLM uses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re not end-to-end neural networks,” Arora explains. “They are classical Bayesian techniques, combined with neural networks.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI vision Bayesian techniques use probability-base methods to teach computers how to interpret visual data. These systems allow the technology to learn by using data and prior knowledge to make decisions — meaning they don’t suffer the hallucination problems of LLMs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead they “get curious,” as Arora put it, to gather information (hence the startup’s name) and make a decision on the next action based on what they’ve learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As old-school as that sounds, Gather AI is sitting at the edge of the next big thing in AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/ai-researchers-embodied-an-llm-into-a-robot-and-it-started-channeling-robin-williams/\">sometimes called “embodied AI.”</a> These are robots that interact with the real world, as opposed to an LLM interacting via computer chat or web app.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To that end, in December, the startup won the <a href=\"https://nebius.com/newsroom/nebius-debuts-the-robotics-and-physical-ai-awards-and-summit-to-support-next-generation-startups-with-1-5-million-in-compute-credits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2025 Nebius Robotics</a> award for Vision AI and Streaming Video Analytics. (Nebius is a Netherlands company that provides AI infrastructure.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gather currently employs about 60 people, Arora said, and customers include Kwik Trip, Axon, GEODIS, and NFI Industries. With this fresh funding, the startup has now raised $74 million total. Other investors include Bain Capital Ventures, XRC Ventures, and Hillman Investments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Previously, CarInsurance.com held the crown at $49.7 million (2010), followed by VacationRentals.com ($35 million in 2007) and Voice.com ($30 million in 2019). Other eye-popping sales include PrivateJet.com ($30 million), 360.com ($17 million), and Sex.com, which has sold twice for over $13 million each time, though its second owner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90332346/how-the-epic-feud-over-the-rights-to-the-sex-com-domain-ended-with-the-ultimate-deception\">went bankrupt </a>trying to monetize it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes,” Fischer told the FT. “When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether these mega-dollar domains actually deliver returns remains an open question.

More than that, I was baffled why anyone would spend time and money on something that seemed guaranteed to outrage cinephiles while offering negligible commercial value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/09/deepfaking-orson-welless-mangled-masterpiece\">an in-depth profile by the New Yorker’s Michael Schulman</a> provides more details about the project. If nothing else, it helps explain why the startup Fable and its founder Edward Saatchi are pursuing it: It seems to come from a genuine love of Welles and his work.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saatchi (whose father was a founder of advertising firm Saatchi &amp; Saatchi) recalled a childhood of watching films in a private screening room with his “movie mad” parents. He said he first saw “Ambersons” when he was twelve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The profile also explains why “Ambersons,” while much less famous than Welles’ first film “Citizen Kane,” remains so tantalizing — Welles himself claimed it was a “much better picture” than “Kane,” but after a disastrous preview screening, the studio cut 43 minutes from the film, added an abrupt and unconvincing happy ending, and eventually destroyed the excised footage to make space in its vaults.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To me, this is the holy grail of lost cinema,” Saatchi said. “It just seemed intuitively that there would be some way to undo what had happened.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saatchi is only the latest Welles devotee to dream of recreating the lost footage. In fact, Fable is working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who already spent years trying to achieve the same thing with animated scenes based on the movie’s script and photographs, and on Welles’ notes. (Rose said that after he screened the results for friends and family, “a lot of them were scratching their heads.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So while Fable is using more advanced technology — filming scenes in live action, then eventually overlaying them with digital recreations of the original actors and their voices — this project is best understood as a slicker, better-funded version of Rose’s work. It’s a fan’s attempt to glimpse Welles’ vision.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, while the New Yorker article includes a few clips of Rose’s animations, as well as images of Fable’s AI actors, there’s no footage showing the results of Fable’s live action-AI hybrid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the company’s own admission, there are significant challenges, whether that’s fixing obvious blunders like a two-headed version of the actor Joseph Cotten, or the more subjective task of recreating the complex beauty of the film’s cinematography. (Saatchi even described a “happiness” problem, with the AI tending to make the film’s women look inappropriately happy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for whether this footage will ever be released to the public, Saatchi admitted it was “a total mistake” not to speak to Welles’ estate before his announcement. Since then, he has reportedly been working to win over both the estate and Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the film. Welles’ daughter Beatrice told Schulman that while she remains “skeptical,” she now believes “they are going into this project with enormous respect toward my father and this beautiful movie.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The actor and biographer Simon Callow — who’s currently writing the fourth book in his multi-volume Welles biography — has also agreed to advise the project, which he described as a “great idea.” (Callow is a family friend of the Saatchis.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But not everyone has been convinced. Melissa Galt said her mother, the actress Anne Baxter, would “not have agreed with that at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not the truth,” Galt said. “It’s a creation of someone else’s truth. But it’s not the original, and she was a purist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while I’ve become more sympathetic to Saatchi’s aims, I still agree with Galt: At its best, this project will only result in a novelty, a dream of what the movie might have been.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, Galt’s description of her mother’s position that “once the movie was done, it was done,” reminded me of a recent essay in which the writer Aaron Bady <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oaklandreviewofbooks.org/sinners-one-battle-after-another-greatness-death/\">compared AI to the vampires in “Sinners.”</a> Bady argued that when it comes to art, both vampires and AI will always come up short, because “what makes art possible” is a knowledge of mortality and limitations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is no work of art without an ending, without the point at which the work ends (even if the world continues),” he wrote, adding, “Without death, without loss, and without the space between my body and yours, separating my memories from yours, we cannot make art or desire or feeling.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that light, Saatchi’s insistence that there <em>must</em> be “some way to undo what had happened” feels, if not outright vampiric, then at least a little childish in its unwillingness to accept that some losses are permanent. It may not, perhaps, be all that different from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/deadbots-ai-grief-obsolete/685811/\">a startup founder claiming they can make grief obsolete</a> — or a studio executive insisting that “The Magnificent Ambersons” needed a happy ending.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Alphabet-owned self-driving company now operates commercial robotaxi services in six markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, and Miami. It has plans to grow its fleet of driverless taxicabs this year to more than a dozen new cities internationally, including London and Tokyo. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And now it has <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-to-scale-robotaxi-fleet-london-tokyo/\">$16 billion</a> to fuel that expansion. Is it enough? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Talking to a few industry watchers, the answer kept landing in the squishy “sort of” and “it depends” territory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First the bull case. Alphabet is clearly committed to ensuring Waymo’s success; the parent company is, and continues to be, the primary investor. Which means Waymo isn’t exposed like other AV startups that suddenly lost funding after their backers (often legacy automakers) got skittish or pivoted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its ridership and autonomous miles driven stats are also exploding and will likely continue in that trajectory unless it is derailed by regulators. (Waymo provides 400,000 rides every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas, and in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This doesn’t guarantee success, though, especially if the gauge is set to profitability. Waymo still must solve several problems, including cost and increasing attention from regulators (the company’s chief safety officer just testified in a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/?modal=short-chief-safety-officer-dr-mauricio-pena-testimony\">Senate Commerce hearing</a>). If Waymo wants to simply be the licensor of its AV tech, it will have to move away from being the operator, which means giving up some control.

He had connections to Prince Andrew but was otherwise a ghost.<br><br>He was on my mind, though, as the Department of Justice started releasing its files on <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>. My curiosity as to whether he would turn up in the documents was quickly overwhelmed by the fact that he was, in fact, a close business partner of the convicted sex offender. He brought Epstein investment opportunities from around the world, and in particular, pitched him on investing in <strong>Faraday Future</strong>, <strong>Lucid Motors</strong>, and Canoo during the go-go days of mobility funding. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/prince-andrew-advisor-pitched-jeffrey-epstein-on-investing-in-ev-startups-like-lucid-motors/\">Read my story</a> on Stern and Epstein’s relationship and how mobility startups were once in the mix.<br><br><em>— Sean O’Kane</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

Many startup founders are applying the AV systems they’ve developed to other use cases, including off-road defense, trucking, forklifts, mining, and construction. Investors, anxious about missing out on the AV party, are jumping into these sectors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Bedrock Robotics</strong> is the latest example of investor interest. The Silicon Valley autonomous vehicle technology startup, founded by veterans of Waymo and Segment, are developing a self-driving system that can be retrofitted onto construction equipment. And it just raised $270 million in Series B funding co-led by CapitalG and the Valor Atreides AI Fund. Other investors include Xora, 8VC, Eclipse, Emergence Capital, Perry Creek Capital, NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm), Tishman Speyer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Georgian, Incharge Capital, C4 Ventures, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bedrock raised more than $350 million in a short time (the company was formed in 2024). And while that might not seem like a lot compared to the size of some seed rounds in the AI labs sector, it shows money is flowing into physical AI startups. I expect more deal flow; importantly I expect the startups focused on practical applications of automated driving systems to attract talent — if they can afford them. Bedrock, for instance, hired Vincent Gonguet, who previously led AI safety and alignment at Meta for all Llama models, as its head of evaluation. It also hired John Chu away from Waymo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keep an eye out for my interview with Bedrock Robotics co-founder and CEO <strong>Boris Sofman</strong>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">German electric motor maker <strong>Additive Drives</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/additive-drives-25m-nordic-alpha-rare-earth-motors/\">raised €25 million</a> ($29.5 million) from Nordic Alpha Partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autonomous underwater vehicles startup <strong>Apeiron Labs</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/apeiron-labs-gets-95m-to-flood-the-oceans-with-autonomous-underwater-robots/\">closed a $9.5 million</a> Series A round led by Dyne Ventures, RA Capital Management Planetary Health, and S2G Investments.

The ruling, published by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, says all new cars sold in the country must have mechanical releases on their door handles by January 1, 2027. There is chatter that Europe could soon follow. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Uber</strong> continues to make moves designed to make it competitive in the autonomous vehicle sector. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/uber-appoints-new-cfo-as-its-av-plans-accelerate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has promoted</a><strong> Balaji Krishnamurthy</strong>, its VP of strategic finance and investor relations, to be its CFO. This may not seem connected to AVs, but it is. Krishnamurthy actively promotes the company’s autonomous ride-hailing partnerships and has a board seat at AV company Waabi. During the company’s Q4 call, he talked about AVs, saying the company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, a high-profile lawsuit against <strong>Uber</strong> has delivered a mixed verdict for the ride-hailing company, which was sued after a woman alleged she was raped by her Uber driver in November 2023. A jury determined Uber was liable as an apparent agent of the driver and awarded $8.5 million to the plaintiff. The jury rejected claims that Uber was liable for negligence or design defects and declined to award punitive damages. An Uber spokesperson, who emailed TechCrunch a statement, said the “verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety. We will continue to put safety at the heart of everything we do.” Uber plans to appeal the decision. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One more thing …</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week in our newsletter, we did a poll asking what the name or ticker of <strong>Elon Musk</strong>’s combined supercompany should be. Thanks to those who emailed their suggestions, many of which had space themes, like Galactic X (great one). As for the poll, the majority picked plain ol’ X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That makes sense, considering Musk has often talked, and posted, about X, the everything app. About 50% voted for X, while 20.7% picked ELON, 17.2% selected SpaceAI, and 12.1% chose K2, a reference to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">one of the corporate entities</a> created in January. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My pick?

Because of that India is adjusting its startup rules, and mobilizing public capital, hoping to help more of them make it to commercial products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, the Indian government <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2224069\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">updated</a> its startup framework, doubling the period for which deep tech companies are treated as startups to 20 years and raising the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant, and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.12 million), from ₹1 billion (around $11.04 million) previously. The change aims to align policy timelines with the long development cycles typical of science- and engineering-led businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change also forms part of New Delhi’s effort to build a long-horizon deep tech ecosystem by combining regulatory reform with public capital, including the ₹1 trillion (around $11 billion) Research, Development and Innovation Fund (RDI), announced last year. That fund is intended to expand patient financing for science-led and R&amp;D-driven companies. Against that backdrop, U.S. and Indian venture firms later came together to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/u-s-and-indian-vcs-just-formed-a-1b-alliance-to-fund-indias-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launch the India Deep Tech Alliance</a>, $1 billion-plus private investor coalition that includes Accel, Blume Ventures, Celesta Capital, Premji Invest, Ideaspring Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, and Kalaari Capital, with chipmaker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nvidia acting as an adviser</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For founders, these changes may fix what some see as an artificial pressure point. Under the previous framework,  companies often risked losing startup status while still pre-commercial, creating a “false failure signal” that judged science-led ventures on policy timelines rather than technological progress, said Vishesh Rajaram, founding partner at Speciale Invest, an Indian deep tech venture capital firm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By formally recognizing deep tech as different, the policy reduces friction in fundraising, follow-on capital, and engagement with the state, which absolutely shows up in a founder’s operating reality over time,” Rajaram told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, investors say access to capital remains a more binding constraint, particularly beyond the early stages. “The biggest gap has historically been funding depth at Series A and beyond, especially for capital-intensive deep tech companies,” Rajaram said. That is where the government’s earlier <a href=\"https://rdifund.anrf.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">RDI fund</a> is meant to play a complementary role.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The real benefit of the RDI framework is to increase the funding available to deep tech companies at early and growth stages,” said Arun Kumar, managing partner at Celesta Capital. By routing public capital through venture funds with tenors similar to private capital, he said, the fund is designed to address chronic gaps in follow-on funding without altering the commercial criteria that govern private investment decisions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital and co-chair of regulatory affairs at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association, said India’s deep tech framework avoids a “graduation cliff” that has historically cut companies off from support just as they scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These policy changes come as the RDI fund is beginning to take shape operationally, Pai said, with the first batch of fund managers identified and the process of selecting venture and private equity managers under way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While private capital for deep tech already exists in India — particularly in areas such as biotech — Pai told TechCrunch the RDI Fund is intended to act as a nucleus around which greater capital formation can occur. Unlike a traditional fund-of-funds, he noted, the vehicle is also designed to take direct positions and provide credit and grants to deep tech startups.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-s-deep-tech-funding-grows\">India’s deep tech funding grows</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of scale, India remains an emerging rather than dominant deep tech market. Indian deep tech startups have raised $8.54 billion in total to date, but recent data point to renewed momentum. Indian deep tech startups raised $1.65 billion in 2025, a sharp rebound from $1.1 billion in each of the previous two years after funding peaked at $2 billion in 2022, per Tracxn. The recovery suggests growing investor confidence, particularly in areas aligned with national priorities such as advanced manufacturing, defence, climate technologies, and semiconductors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, the pickup in funding suggests a gradual move toward longer-horizon investing,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, U.S. deep tech startups raised about $147 billion in 2025, more than 80 times the amount deployed in India that year, while China accounted for roughly $81 billion, data from Tracxn shows. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The disparity highlights the challenge India faces in building capital-intensive technologies, even with its wealth of engineering talent. So the hope is that these moves by the Indian government will lead to more investor participation over the medium term.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090651\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=768,540 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1200,843 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1280,899 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=430,302 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=720,506 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=900,632 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=800,562 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1536,1079 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=668,469 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=534,375 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=878,617 878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=708,497 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-longer-term-signal\">A longer-term signal</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For global investors, New Delhi’s framework change is being read as a signal of longer-term policy intent rather than a trigger for immediate shifts in allocation. “Deep tech companies operate on seven- to twelve-year horizons, so regulatory recognition that stretches the lifecycle gives investors greater confidence that the policy environment will not change mid-journey,” said Pratik Agarwal, a partner at Accel. While he said the change would not alter allocation models overnight or eliminate policy risk entirely, it increased investor comfort that India is thinking about deep tech on longer time horizons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The change shows that India is learning from the U.S. and Europe on how to create patient frameworks for frontier building,” Agarwal told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether the move will reduce the tendency of Indian startups to shift their headquarters overseas as they scale remains an open question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The extended runway strengthens the case for building and staying in India, Agarwal said, though access to capital and customers still matters. Over the past five years, he added, India’s public markets have shown a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/india-already-an-ipo-bright-spot-prepares-for-bigger-surge-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">growing appetite for venture-backed tech companies</a>, making domestic listings a more credible option than in the past. That, in turn, could ease some of the pressure on deep tech founders to incorporate overseas, even if access to procurement and late-stage capital will continue to shape where companies ultimately scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For investors backing long-horizon technologies, the ultimate test will be whether India can deliver globally competitive outcomes. The real signal, Kumar of Celesta Capital said, would be the emergence of a critical mass of Indian deep tech companies succeeding on the world stage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It would be great to see ten globally competitive deep tech companies from India achieve sustained success over the next decade,” he said, describing that as the benchmark he would look for in assessing whether India’s deep tech ecosystem is maturing.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan is expected to be there. Apple’s Tim Cook, too. (He has become a Super Bowl fixture since Apple Music began sponsoring the halftime show several years ago.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Longtime VC Venky Ganesan from Menlo Ventures gave the New York Times a quote about the whole thing, saying the Super Bowl in the Bay Area is “tech billionaires who got picked last in gym class paying $50,000 to pretend they’re friends with the guys who got picked first.” Added Ganesan, “And for the record, I, too, was picked last in gym class.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ganesan could likely afford a $50,000 ticket if he needed one. Menlo went all-in on Anthropic, setting up a $100 million fund with the AI company in summer 2024 to invest in other AI startups. The firm has also joined numerous funding rounds for Anthropic itself, both through its flagship fund and various special purpose vehicles. (Anthropic is reportedly expected to close a <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-more-20-billion-funding-010451731.html\">$20 billion round</a> of funding next week at a post-money valuation of $350 billion.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tickets are expensive across the board, averaging almost $7,000 according to the Times (with some last-minute seats still available on StubHub for closer to $3,600, according to a quick glance at the ticket reseller site). Only a quarter go to the general public; the rest are distributed to NFL teams. Of all ticket buyers, the largest group (27%) is coming from Washington State for the Seahawks, who’ve won just one Super Bowl in franchise history compared with the Patriots’ six titles, all with Tom Brady as quarterback.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1yGy9fELtE\">Google</a>, OpenAI, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQRu7DdTTVA\">Anthropic</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCyiXmxHqSg\">Amazon</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NerlyGrv7WM\">Meta</a> are splashing out for competing ads about whose AI is best for customers, so maybe their respective CEOs will show up, too.
