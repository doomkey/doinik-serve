            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has identified at least 80 instances in which Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software violated road rules by running red lights or crossing into the wrong lane, according to a <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INIM-PE25012-30897.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new letter</a> sent to the automaker this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NHTSA said in the letter it has received 62 complaints from Tesla drivers, 14 reports submitted by Tesla, and four media reports that describe potential violations. That’s up from around 50 violations NHTSA cited when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-for-traffic-safety-violations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened an investigation into the behavior</a> in October. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The federal safety agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is probing whether Tesla’s driver assistance software can “accurately detect and appropriately respond to traffic signals, signs and lane markings,” according to the letter. ODI is also evaluating whether Tesla’s software is providing sufficient warnings to drivers in these situations. Tesla’s responses are due January 19, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The increase in complaints is notable in part because the original batch reported by ODI in October included multiple reports from one particular intersection in Joppa, Maryland. Tesla told the agency at the time that it had already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection.” The agency didn’t say where, geographically, these newly reported incidents took place. Tesla heavily redacts <a href=\"https://fuelarc.com/tech/redacted-tesla-asked-for-redactions-on-every-self-driving-crash-reported-to-the-nhtsa-since-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its own submissions</a> to the agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new letter was sent to Tesla the same week that CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/musk-says-new-tesla-software-allows-texting-and-driving-which-is-illegal-in-most-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">claimed in a post on X</a> that the latest version of FSD will allow drivers to text and drive while using the driver assistance software, which is illegal in nearly every state. NHTSA has not responded to requests for comment about Musk’s statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter is meant to kick off the discovery process for NHTSA, and as such it details a number of requests for information the agency has made to Tesla. For instance, the agency is asking for data on how many Tesla vehicles are equipped with FSD, as well as how often the software is engaged. ODI is also asking Tesla to turn over any customer complaints it has received regarding these specific problems with FSD, including from fleet operators and from any lawsuits or third-party arbitration proceedings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the second investigation that NHTSA has opened into Tesla’s FSD software. In October 2024, the agency began a probe into how FSD handles <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-by-federal-safety-regulator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">low-visibility situations like fog or extreme sunlight</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Drawing on his engineering background, he decided to build the device himself, using a more than century-old technology: the electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect and measure electrical activity in the brain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While EEG is used clinically to diagnose diseases such as epilepsy and sleep disorders, it can also detect psychological stress by measuring high-frequency brain waves called beta waves. When those rapid beta waves persist for extended periods, they can lead to exhaustion, insomnia, and mental distress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Forenza collaborated with data scientists and biomedical engineers to develop <a href=\"https://www.awear.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Awear</a>, a small device worn behind the ear for continuous brainwave monitoring. The device transmits results to an app, which provides information about the wearer’s mood and offers AI-powered coaching advice for managing stress and improving emotional resilience.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our brain is phenomenal at self-adjusting and makes us believe we are not stressed,” Forenza said. “It’s fine to be in ‘fight or flight’ every once in a while. It’s part of our nature. But if you fall into the trap of constant ‘fight or flight’, then that leads to chronic stress, depression, anxiety.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Forenza claims that Awear helps users proactively intercept excessive stress before it leads to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">negative health effects</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Awear is a Startup Battlefield 200 finalist at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2025&amp;utm_content=ticketsales&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>,  where it won health category pitch competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Stanford University’s psychiatry department is currently testing the device to detect confusion and disorientation in elderly patients after surgery, Forenza’s primary focus is on selling Awear to individual consumers, similar to the approach taken by the Oura ring and other consumer wearables.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, Awear closed a pre-seed funding round led by Hustle Fund, Niremia Collective, Techstars, and The Pitch Fund, and the company plans to raise a $5 million seed round in early 2026.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Awear is available for purchase only through its early-access program. The device is available to early adopters — a group that already includes many other startup founders, a notoriously stressed-out group — for $195, which includes a complimentary lifetime app subscription.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After raising its seed round, the company will launch a Kickstarter campaign, following a strategy used by devices such as Peloton and Oura. “It is a path that worked for many other wearables. It gives you a lot of visibility, and it’s a good way to acquire customers,” Forenza said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company, which made an AI-powered pendant to record your conversations, says it will no longer sell its hardware devices and will maintain support for its existing customers for a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software “Rewind,” which recorded users’<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/01/rewind-wants-to-revamp-how-you-remember-with-millions-from-a16z/\"> desktop activity</a> and turned it into a searchable record.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettbejcek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Brett Bejcek</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dsiroker?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dan Siroker,</a> the co-founder and former chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Optimizely</a>, pivoted to become an AI device maker last year, offering its Limitless pendant for $99. The wearable could attach to your shirt like a wireless mic or be worn like a necklace. The device is one of several AI hardware devices on the market, including another (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/magazine/friend-wearable-ai-companion.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">not very well-received</a>) AI pendant known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/friend-delays-shipments-of-its-ai-companion-pendant/\">Friend</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Limitless’ announcement, the company shares in Meta’s vision to “bring personal superintelligence to everyone,” which includes building AI-enabled wearables. (Meta is focused for now on AR/AI glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta, and its in-lens AI glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display.) Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life — which likely means supporting Meta’s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/altman-describes-openais-forthcoming-ai-device-as-more-peaceful-and-calm-than-the-iphone/\">larger players like OpenAI</a> and Meta are developing their own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">hardware</a> devices, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,” wrote Siroker in the announcement. “AI was a pipe dream to many. Hardware startups were considered unfundable, and a business that did both AI and hardware would have been considered ludicrous. But today is different. The world has changed. We’re no longer working on a weird fringe idea. We’re building a future that now seems inevitable. We’re not alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta shared the following statement with TechCrunch via email: “We’re excited that Limitless will be joining Meta to help accelerate our work to build AI-enabled wearables.” The tech giant didn’t share further information about its plans, beyond noting that the team will work in the wearables organization of Reality Labs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Limitless will offer its customers a way to <a href=\"https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13004987-how-to-download-your-limitless-transcripts-and-account-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">export</a> their data, the company said, or users can choose to <a href=\"https://help.limitless.ai/en/articles/13005203-how-to-delete-your-limitless-account-and-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delete</a> their data from within the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/a16z-backed-rewind-pivots-to-build-ai-powered-pendant-to-record-your-conversations/\">raised</a> more than $33 million in funding from investors, including a16z, First Round Capital, and NEA. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Limitless has been acquired by Meta\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uuGTJzl1OVU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated after publication with Meta’s comment. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The missive, penned by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, instructed staff to focus on improving the company’s AI products, particularly in areas like personalization, reliability, image generation, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When looking at the recent data, it’s clear the race is not over yet: Both ChatGPT and Gemini continue to see sizable growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT has seen its global monthly active users climb by 180% year-over-year as of November 2025, while Gemini’s monthly active users are up 170%. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073348\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg 1358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=1200,772 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=1280,824 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=430,277 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=720,463 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=900,579 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=800,515 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=668,430 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=583,375 583w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=959,617 959w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=708,456 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/maus-2025-12-05-at-12.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sensor Tower</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the new data indicates that ChatGPT’s global monthly active users only grew by around 6% from August to November, to reach roughly 810 million. (The monthly active user numbers in the above chart are rounded, the firm notes.) This figure could suggest the AI chatbot is nearing market saturation, Sensor Tower says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Google Gemini’s global monthly active users jumped by around 30% during the same time frame, as the release of its new image generation model, Nano Banana, drove increased adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the report noted that around two times more U.S. Android users now engage with Gemini directly through the Android operating system compared with using the standalone Gemini mobile app. This could provide Google with a competitive advantage in the global market, where Android dominates, as it means Gemini isn’t constrained to only being used within a mobile app or web interface.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini is also increasing its share of the overall AI chatbot market when compared across all top apps like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok. Over the past seven months (May-November 2025), Gemini increased its share of global monthly active users by three percentage points, the firm estimates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But ChatGPT saw its share of global monthly active users drop three percentage points over the past four months (August-November 2025), by comparison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Challenges from Perplexity and Claude may also be impacting ChatGPT, as both rivals saw triple-digit growth for their respective chatbots in 2025, with the former up 370% year-over-year, and the latter up 190%. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073349\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg 1408w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=1200,779 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=1280,831 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=430,279 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=720,467 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=900,584 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=800,519 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=668,434 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=578,375 578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=950,617 950w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=708,460 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/downloads-2025-12-05-at-12.00.04-PM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sensor Tower</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT also saw its global downloads grow by 85% year-over-year as of November, but this lagged the overall cohort’s average growth of 110%. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity and Gemini saw the largest growth, up 215% and 190% year-over-year, respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, Gemini app users’ time spent in the app has more than doubled over the past few months, Sensor Tower said. As of November, Gemini users were spending 11 minutes per day in the app, up 120% from March. This is likely due to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/gemini-tops-the-app-store-thanks-to-new-ai-image-model-nano-banana/\">popularity</a> of its image generation model, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/google-geminis-ai-image-model-gets-a-bananas-upgrade/\">Nano Banana</a>, in September. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s users’ daily time spent only increased by 6% during the same time frame. Plus, ChatGPT users’ time spent was down 10% in November, compared with July. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the current data indicates Google could be catching up with the market leader, much of its recent gains have to do with the success of Nano Banana. OpenAI could speed up growth again with the release of its own new products, if they make a similar impact. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

AI for enterprise was everywhere. But are its customers just as eager?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS CEO Matt Garman acknowledged during his keynote that enterprises haven’t seen a return on AI investment yet. He thinks that’s about to change — and fast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe that the advent of AI agents has brought us to an inflection point in AI’s trajectory,” Garman said. “It’s turning from a technical wonder into something that delivers us real value. This change is going to have as much impact on your business as the internet or the cloud.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While analysts told TechCrunch they were impressed by some of AWS’ tech announcements this week, they aren’t sure it’s enough to move the needle on enterprise AI adoption or change AWS’ position in the AI race.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is one of the market leaders when it comes to cloud infrastructure; the same can’t be said for its enterprise AI offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google hold a commanding lead when it comes to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">enterprise market share</a> for actual AI models.

Instead, it was the infrastructure announcements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AWS AI factory is really compelling,” Feller said about a new initiative that allows customers to run <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\">AWS AI in their own data centers</a>. “AWS is a huge player in where the models are being run and is dominant in the cloud industry. I think that is where Amazon’s expertise really lies. It’s a good thing to double down on where they have expertise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Feller likes that AWS is looking to make a vertical AI play, but he thinks it may make more sense to do so through partnerships with other AI players like Anthropic and Nvidia as opposed to using all of their own AI technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite all of this, AWS is still well-positioned to carve out market share in the AI sector, while continuing to grow its core businesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS’ position as an industry-leading cloud provider means it has a solid business foundation despite what happens in the AI market because it provides the rails for the industry’s technology — regardless of what the AI trend of the moment is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the AI industry ends up being the bubble some say it is, AWS, which recorded <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/aws-exceeds-wall-streets-expectations-as-demand-for-cloud-infra-remains-high/\">$11.4 billion in operating income</a> in the third quarter, will likely be less affected by a negative change in AI market conditions than its peers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This gives AWS room to experiment and iterate on what its place in the AI market could look like down the road. That’s why even if enterprises aren’t ready for the tech they release today, AWS should keep working to improve it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>, and see all the announcements <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/all-the-biggest-news-from-aws-big-tech-show-reinvent-2025/\">you may have missed thus far here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

One key advantage of these eSIM-only phones is that they offer slightly larger battery life than the models with a physical SIM slot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Analytics firm Counterpoint said that in 2024, the penetration of smartphones with eSIM was just 23%. The U.S. is the strongest market for eSIM, with 41% of devices launched in 2024 having eSIM capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until recently, eSIM has been a feature of top-end devices, but that is changing slowly.

Pablo Iacopino, an analyst at GSMA, said local manufacturers like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo will also likely launch more eSIM-native or supported devices.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071149\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg 1245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,106 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,271 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,240 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=1200,423 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=430,152 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=720,254 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=900,317 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=800,282 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=668,236 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=708,250 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.49.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,18 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>GSMA</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These manufacturers have a big share in economically sensitive markets in Asia and Africa. They can gradually include eSIM support across price ranges to support the domestic demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Chinese brands, when they see that the Chinese MNOs have launched eSIM services for the domestic Chinese market, they will probably start introducing eSIM across a wider range of smartphones, including, medium and low-end market,” Iacopino said. “But I don’t think they will go eSIM only immediately. They will start with supporting both physical and eSIM, before shifting to eSIM-only models.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, even within devices with eSIM support, few people are using the technology — but that’s changing. Steffen Sorrell, head of research at Kaleido Intelligence, a telecom analyst firm, said that it observed a 30% activation rate in devices with eSIM capabilities in 2024. The firm estimates that the rate will go up to 75% by 2030.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-travel-is-a-big-catalyst\">Travel is a big catalyst</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While you are traveling, eSIM is one of the most convenient ways to get connectivity. A GSMA survey said that 51% of people using eSIM use it for travel. Plus, it is a more secure solution, given that often eSIM hardware is bound with secure hardware elements, making it difficult to tamper with.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These elements have been positive for eSIM provider startups Airalo, Holafly, eSIM.me, Nomad, and Truely. Even the Lithuania-based security provider Nord launched an <a href=\"https://saily.com/blog/category/news/page-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eSIM service called Saily</a>. Most of these companies have seen growth in their customer base, and that’s largely thanks to travel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GSMA said that travel is currently proving to be a strong catalyst for eSIM growth, as frequent travelers prefer to buy devices with eSIM support. Plus, they could adopt eSIM for their long-term usage.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071150\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg 1570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=768,396 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=1200,619 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=1280,660 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=430,222 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=720,371 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=900,464 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=800,413 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=1536,792 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=668,345 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=1196,617 1196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=708,365 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.42.49-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kaleido Intelligence</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People might experience eSIM for the first time while traveling. These users who like the eSIM experience would go back home and request their network providers to make a switch from a physical SIM,” GSMA’s Iacopino told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airalo is one of the biggest eSIM companies around and has been active for more than six years. The company’s CEO, Bahadir Ozdemir, said that the app is responsible for many users experiencing eSIM for the first time. The company did a survey on its app last year, with 85% of responders being first-time eSIM users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Roughly 15% of travel connectivity is being powered by eSIMs, and the number is growing. Once users discover how they can get connectivity with eSIM, they don’t really want to go back to the old way [physical SIMs] of doing it,” Ozdemir noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said that while a lot of telecom operators offer eSIMs, it is not easy for customers to discover those, and apps like Airalo make the process easier. Network providers are also thinking about the travel eSIM market. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.com/news/corporate-and-financial/vodafone-launches-major-partnership-with-uefa-and-uc-3-to-power-the-future-of-women-s-and-men-s-football\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vodafone partnered with UEFA to launch a specialized eSIM</a> for travelers attending football matches across the continent.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-growth-and-investor-interest\">Growth and investor interest</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Travel-related eSIM startups have seen notable growth. Truely said it has served more than 70,000 travelers over the last two years, with 2x order growth this year. The startup, which raised a <a href=\"https://e27.co/truely-tops-up-funding-to-us5-5m-to-boost-travel-connectivity-solutions-20250602/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$2 million extension round in June</a>, said that apart from partnering with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/truely_truely-moneyx-esim-activity-7361495714272595968-YJiE/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fintech services</a> and <a href=\"https://farefirst.truely.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">travel apps</a>, it is also exploring governmental collaborations in different regions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NordVPN said that its Saily eSIM app saw a seven-digit user base after its launch in March 2024. The company also launched <a href=\"https://nordsecurity.com/press-area/travel-esim-app-saily-debuts-ultra-a-new-premium-plan-for-unparalleled-journeys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a $60 per month Ultra plan with global coverage</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071151\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg 673w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=430,259 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=668,403 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=622,375 622w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-1.50.50-PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>GSMA</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Holafly said that it has sold more than 15 million eSIMs since its inception in 2018 and has crossed $500 million in total revenue. The startup noted that out of that figure, it earned $200 million in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airalo’s blockbuster <a href=\"https://www.cvc.com/media/news/2025/airalo-becomes-the-first-esim-unicorn-with-an-investment-round-of-220m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$220 million round, led by CVC and announced in July</a>, made it a unicorn and was the most notable eSIM investment in the last two years. Meanwhile, French eSIM startup Kolet nabbed <a href=\"https://www.phocuswire.com/kolet-raises-10-million-dollars-series-a-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$10 million in Series A funding</a> led by Daphni with participation from former Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern and Apple’s former vice president of marketing Jon Gieselman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scott Shiao, a principal at Goodwater Capital, said that the investment concentration will be on travel-related eSIM startups on the consumer side for the time being, but there could be an opportunity in domestic markets in the future as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Martell Hardenberg, a partner at Antler, said that while the travel eSIM use case has grown, a lot of users can be considered early adopters, and there is still much room to grow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there is opportunity in offering bundled services to global travelers or digital nomads about what can companies offer beyond travel SIM cards and make it a lucrative package for these user profiles,” Hardenberg told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors will likely look for offering, marketability for long-term bet as there might be consolidation a few years down the line, Kaledio’s Sorrell said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The market is obviously on its way up, but I think sooner or later we’re going to reach a saturation point in terms of the providers on the market there. So investors will look into the long-term viability of the business along with things like customer loyalty, quality of coverage, and even association with marketing capabilities, how you’re able to promote that eSIM, whether it’s through airlines, banks, or cab companies,” he said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-challenges-in-adoption\">Challenges in adoption</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A couple of roadblocks in adoption are education, trust, and ease of use. A lot of people just don’t know what an eSIM is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Spotify can tell people to download Spotify because people know about music, and Netflix can tell people to download Netflix because people know about TV shows,” Airalo’s Ozdemir said. “But we couldn’t do that with Airalo, as a lot of people don’t know about eSIMs.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He noted that the company regularly partners with different influencers to educate people about connectivity on the go through eSIM and redirects them to Airalo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truely CEO Eric Dadoun believes that given there is a steady rise in devices that are eSIM only, consumers would be forced to know about the technology as well. He said that companies working in the eSIM industry will still focus on user education for customer acquisition in markets where buying an eSIM-only device is optional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the thornier parts of using an eSIM is that when you buy a plan from any of the apps, you get a QR code in your email that you need to scan to install the eSIM. This means that you need a second device that displays the QR code. The whole process is cumbersome if you are visiting another country and you want to buy an eSIM when you are at an airport. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GSMA’s Iacopino agreed that the process is cumbersome for many users, and as adoption grows, eSIM providers and hardware makers will need to figure out a way to make the process smooth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kaleido Intelligence’s Sorrell noted that for some network providers, the move to eSIM is slower, as they have legacy technology and systems that are proving to be a roadblock. They would also need to make the process of switching to this tech fully digital so customers don’t have to visit a store. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The expansion is called “A Safehouse in the Hills” and is available starting December 10.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if the vans in the trailer have been, in true Grand Theft Auto fashion, hijacked by playable characters, or if they’ve gone rogue. It seems likely it’s the latter, though, as Rockstar Games says players will be encouraged to “stop the development of a mass surveillance network in an all-new action-packed adventure” as part of the DLC. (The trailer also teases a storyline that involves an AI assistant named “Haviland,” so the tech world in general appears to be a part of this particular storyline.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has said it will deny government requests for the footage its vehicles capture if those requests are “overly broad and unlawful.” But its robotaxis have nevertheless drawn criticism for being part of a growing surveillance state. That frustration has contributed to the company’s vehicles becoming a target of multiple instances of vandalism. Waymo SUVs have been burned, smashed, and had their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/waymo-cameras-capture-footage-of-man-charged-in-alleged-robotaxi-tire-slashings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tires slashed</a> in different cities over the last few years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rockstar is clearly tapping into those same dynamics here, as the tagline for KnoWay’s “autonomous hailing system” in the game is: “We Kno where you’re going.” It’s not hard to imagine some players of the DLC taking some of their frustrations out on the virtual vehicles once the update is released later this month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo declined to comment. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/waymo-co-ceo-on-robotaxi-vandalism-were-not-standing-for-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spoke out</a> against the vandalism, saying her company was “very focused on working with law enforcement to make sure that we pursue the people who are committing these crimes against our fleet.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He lost, but the moment forever changed the way he saw the place — and local governments, for that matter. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was trying to become a better candidate,” he recalled to TechCrunch. “I wanted to understand how my city actually worked, what decisions had been made, why, who said what. And I couldn’t figure it out. It’s a total black box, and almost intentionally opaque.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since COVID, towns across the nation have started recording and posting their city meetings online. That gave Rajaraman an idea: a company that helped people understand what was happening in local governments. That same year, in 2022, he launched Hamlet to do just that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We use AI to process thousands of hours of city council and planning commission meeting videos and turn them into intelligence they can actually use,” he said. He said these videos are better than meeting minutes because those documents are just someone’s interpretations of what happened. “The video doesn’t lie.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At first, he thought it would be a media company, but then real estate developers and political action committees started reaching out. Rajaraman realized that private companies have to deal with local governments, too, and they also want more insight into what is happening in those city council meetings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For enterprise customers, the company helps track agendas and alerts them when relevant topics are addressed across target cities. It also synthesizes what happened after meetings, so they don’t have to watch hourslong videos, and it lets them search the video archive to see, for example, when and how a competitor was mentioned in a local government setting.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hamlet has raised around $10 million in venture funding to date, from backers including Slow Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Banana Capital, and Kapor Capital. “We want to become the ‘Bloomberg’ of this space, so to speak,” Rajaraman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, Rajaraman announced he is expanding the company to launch Hamlet TV as a way to help keep regular citizens informed of what is happening inside their governments. The streaming channel is on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@my_hamlet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6OdfDFY578UcEzOf_jv37Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">YouTube,</a> AppleTV, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/my_hamlet_tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Instagram</a>, and will spotlight important moments from council, commission, and school board meetings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rajaraman said his company has processed thousands of hours of government meetings for government customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen meetings that have lasted 15-plus hours without recess,” he said. He and his team started curating funny moments from those meetings, and they thought it was a good idea to use humor to get people more invested in the U.S. democracy. “If you show people procedural videos, they are just not going to care. But if you show them the funny stuff, they’ll watch.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most surprising thing he and his team have seen so far on Hamlet TV has been someone dressing up as a cockroach to address their city council about a pest problem. But it’s not the funny stuff that surprises him, he said. “It’s how consequential these meetings are and how invisible they remain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He cited an example from earlier this year when the Tucson city council rejected Amazon’s $3.6 billion data center. He said that the decision came after months of planning, but only a few people likely watched those videos to understand why it happened.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t Rajaraman’s first time running a business — or a media outlet. He co-founded the analytics platform Scripted and was twice an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Foundation Capital. He also ran a publication called The Bold Italic, then sold it to Medium.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He knows Hamlet TV probably won’t be a moneymaker and reiterated that he’s doing this to get people more involved with the state of the country’s democracy. He also plans to give away the Hamlet tool to local journalists for free. “Data is great, but context matters so much,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next, the Hamlet company is looking to work with government affairs, advocacy organizations, and renewable energy developers. “Democracy works better when people are watching,” he said. “We’re trying to make watching possible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Times joins several media outlets suing Perplexity, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/chicago-tribune-sues-perplexity/\">Chicago Tribune</a>, which also filed suit this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Times’ suit claims that “Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute” for the outlet, “without permission or remuneration.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit — filed even as several publishers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/the-new-york-times-and-amazon-ink-ai-licensing-deal/\">including The Times</a>, negotiate deals with AI firms — is part of the same, ongoing years-long strategy. Recognizing the AI tide cannot be stopped, publishers use lawsuits as leverage in negotiations in the hopes of forcing AI companies to formally license content in ways that compensate creators and maintain the economic viability of original journalism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity tried to address compensation demands by launching a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/perplexitys-plan-to-share-ad-revenue-with-outlets-cited-by-its-ai-chatbot/\">Publishers’ Program last year,</a> which offers participating outlets like Gannett, TIME, Fortune and the Los Angeles Times a share of ad revenue. In August, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/perplexitys-comet-ai-browser-now-free-max-users-get-new-background-assistant/\">Perplexity also launched Comet Plus</a>, allocating 80% of its $5 monthly fee to participating publishers, and recently struck a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/perplexity-strikes-multi-year-licensing-deal-with-getty-images/\">multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity’s unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products,” Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. “We will continue to work to hold companies accountable that refuse to recognize the value of our work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to the Tribune’s suit, the Times takes issue with Perplexity’s method for answering user queries by gathering information from websites and databases to generate responses via its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) products, like its chatbots and Comet browser AI assistant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Perplexity then repackages the original content in written responses to users,” the suit reads. “Those responses, or outputs, often are verbatim or near-verbatim reproductions, summaries, or abridgments of the original content, including The Times’s copyrighted works.”  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or, as James put it in his statement,  “RAG allows Perplexity to crawl the internet and steal content from behind our paywall and deliver it to its customers in real time. That content should only be accessible to our paying subscribers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Times also claims Perplexity’s search engine has hallucinated information and falsely attributed it to the outlet, which damages its brand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Publishers have been suing new tech companies for a hundred years, starting with radio, TV, the internet, social media, and now AI,” Jesse Dwyer, Perplexity’s head of communications, told TechCrunch. “Fortunately it’s never worked, or we’d all be talking about this by telegraph.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Publishers have, at times, won or shaped major legal battles over new technologies, resulting in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\">settlements</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">licensing regimes</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press_v._Meltwater_U.S._Holdings,_Inc.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">court precedents</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit comes just over a year after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/new-york-times-sends-perplexity-cease-and-desist-letter-demands-it-stops-using-its-content-in-ai-summaries/\">The Times sent a cease and desist letter to Perplexity</a> demanding it stop using its content for summaries and other output. The outlet claims it has contacted Perplexity several times over the past 18 months to stop using its content unless an agreement could be negotiated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t the first fight The Times has picked with an AI firm. The Times is also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/the-new-york-times-wants-openai-and-microsoft-to-pay-for-training-data/\">suing OpenAI and its backer Microsoft</a>, claiming the two trained their AI systems with millions of the outlet’s articles without offering compensation. OpenAI has argued that its use of publicly available data for AI training constitutes “fair use,” and has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/sam-altman-comes-out-swinging-at-the-new-york-times/\">shot its own accusations</a> at the Times, claiming the outlet manipulated ChatGPT to find evidence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That case is still ongoing, but a similar lawsuit directed against OpenAI competitor Anthropic could set a precedent in regards to fair use for training AI systems going forward. In that suit, in which authors and publishers sued the AI firm for using pirated books to train its models, the court ruled that while lawfully acquired books might be a safe fair use application, pirated ones infringe on copyrights. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\">Anthropic agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Times’ lawsuit adds to mounting legal pressure on Perplexity. Last year, News Corp — which owns outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, and the New York Post — made similar claims against Perplexity. That list grew in 2025 to also include Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, Asahi Shimbun, and Reddit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other outlets, including Wired and Forbes, have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/news-outlets-are-accusing-perplexity-of-plagiarism-and-unethical-web-scraping/\">accused Perplexity of plagiarism</a> and unethically crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don’t want to be scraped. The latter claim is one that internet infrastructure provider <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/perplexity-accused-of-scraping-websites-that-explicitly-blocked-ai-scraping/\">Cloudflare recently confirmed</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its suit, The Times is asking the courts to make Perplexity pay for the harm allegedly caused and ban the startup from continuing to use its content. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Times is clearly not above working with AI firms that compensate for its reporters’ work. The outlet earlier this year<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/the-new-york-times-and-amazon-ink-ai-licensing-deal/\"> struck a multi-year deal with Amazon</a> to license its content to train the tech giant’s AI models. Several other publishers and media companies have signed licensing deals with AI firms to use their content for training and to feature in chatbot responses. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/22/whats-in-it-for-us-journalists-ask-as-publications-sign-content-deals-with-openai/\">OpenAI has inked deals</a> with Associated Press, Axel Springer, Vox Media, The Atlantic, and more.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated with comment from Perplexity.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In the third quarter, 4.7 gigawatts of batteries were installed. In sum, more than 40 gigawatts have been deployed, and the year isn’t over, Canary Media <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/grid-storage-industry-crushes-2025-goal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a>. In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, that’s nearly half of all new renewable power deployed on the grid for July through September, and this year, renewables have been the <a href=\"https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">leading source</a> of all new capacity, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the new storage capacity has been deployed in Arizona, California, and Texas, states where the grid has been strained in recent years. Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups have been taking note. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Redwood Materials, which was co-founded by Tesla alumnus JB Straubel, in June added a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/redwood-materials-launches-energy-storage-business-and-its-first-target-is-ai-data-centers/\">new business line</a> focused on repurposing used EV batteries for grid-scale storage. The company noticed two overlapping trends: The batteries that were arriving at its recycling facilities still had plenty of life left in them, and meanwhile, the battery storage industry was growing in leaps and bounds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2028, Redwood plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours’ worth of battery storage. Investors have voiced their approval, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/redwood-materials-raises-another-350-million-to-power-up-its-energy-storage-business/\">investing another $350 million</a> in the company to propel the new business line. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another startup, Base Power, has taken a slightly different tack, leasing batteries to homeowners and aggregating them to serve as a large virtual power plant. The Austin-based startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/base-power-raises-1b-to-deploy-home-batteries-everywhere/\">raised $1 billion</a> in October to help build a battery factory and fuel its expansion beyond Texas. The company has deployed more than 100 megawatt-hours of batteries in Texas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While lithium-ion batteries have dominated new installations, other startups are pursuing other technologies that could lower storage costs significantly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sizable Energy is working on a novel way to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/one-startups-quest-to-store-electricity-in-the-ocean/\">store power in flexible reservoirs</a> that float in the open ocean. Fourth Power is using blocks of carbon to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/fourth-powers-sci-fi-thermal-batteries-could-be-cheaper-than-pricey-natural-gas-power-plants/\">store heat at super-high temperatures</a>, and it’s looking to deploy them in 2028 at a cost that’s lower than lithium-ion batteries or peaking natural gas power plants. XL Batteries is deploying its flow-battery technology at petrochemical storage sites, allowing it to store hundreds of megawatt-hours using existing infrastructure. And, Cache Energy has developed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/22/cache-energys-mysterious-white-pellets-could-help-kill-coal-and-natural-gas/\">inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide</a> that could store energy for months with minimal losses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altogether, it points to an industry that’s in the midst of an exponential expansion. Paired with solar and wind, which remain the <a href=\"https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus-lcoeplus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cheapest forms of new electricity</a>, energy storage has the potential to rewire global energy markets, and the U.S. grid along with them.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/twitters-legacy-blue-checkmark-era-is-officially-over/\">did away</a> with that policy in 2023, and all the “verified” blue check today indicates is that a user subscribes to X Premium, and that they meet certain eligibility criteria, like having a profile photo, a display name, and have linked their account to a phone number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“X’s use of the ‘blue checkmark’ for ‘verified accounts’ deceives users,” the Commission wrote in a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a>. “This violates the DSA obligation for online platforms to prohibit deceptive design practices on their services. On X, anyone can pay to obtain the ‘verified’ status without the company meaningfully verifying who is behind the account, making it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and content they engage with.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Commission added that such a system exposes users to scams, impersonation fraud, and manipulation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The regulator also found that X’s advertisement repository doesn’t comply with DSA requirements for transparency and accessibility, saying the company imposes excessive delays in processing requests for access. The Commission also said the ads repository doesn’t house important information like the content or topic of ads, as well as who paid for those ads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This hinders researchers and the public to independently scrutinise any potential risks in online advertising,” the Commission wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Access to public data is another area of concern for the EU. The DSA mandates that public platforms allow researchers access to public data to study systemic risks, and the EC’s investigation has found that X does not allow researchers to independently do that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Moreover, X’s processes for researchers’ access to public data impose unnecessary barriers, effectively undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union,” the EC wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision comes two years after the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/x-dsa-probe/\">EC launched an investigation into the company</a> on the suspected breach of rules linked to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency, and data access for researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads, and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU,” Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy at the European Commission, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X now has 60 days to outline how it intends to address the complaint about the blue checkmarks, and 90 days to respond with an action plan for addressing the breaches relating to ads and public data transparency and accessibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Confirmed breaches of the DSA can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By making this move, Netflix is not just solidifying its top position but also significantly enhancing its content library, gaining access to well-known franchises such as DC Comics, “Game of Thrones,” and “Harry Potter.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Netflix boasted over 300 million paying subscribers in January, HBO Max, in combination with Discovery+, currently has around 128 million subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the scale of Netflix’s offer is notable, as the streaming giant is investing $72 billion, which exceeds Warner Bros.’ entire market valuation of $60 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, this merger isn’t without its challenges; it could face antitrust scrutiny. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal expressed concerns regarding the potential sale.

He said that someday, he’d ask the AI. When everyone snickered, he added, “You can laugh. It’s all right. But it really is what I <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/18/sam-altmans-leap-of-faith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">actually believe</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He wasn’t kidding.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sitting again in front of an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/strictlyvc-palo-alto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">audience</a>, this time across from Max Hodak, the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://science.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Science Corp</a>., I can’t help but remember that moment with Altman. Pale-complexioned Hodak, wearing jeans and a black zip-up sweatshirt, looks more like he’d fit in in a mosh pit than pitching a company valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. But he’s got a sly sense of humor that keeps the room engaged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hodak started programming when he was six, and as an undergraduate at Duke, he worked his way into the lab of Miguel Nicolelis, a pioneering neuroscientist who has since become publicly critical of commercial brain-computer interface ventures. In 2016, Hodak co-founded Neuralink with Elon Musk, serving as its president and essentially running day-to-day operations until 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I ask what he learned working alongside Musk, Hodak describes a specific pattern. “We got into lots of situations together where something would happen. In my mind, I’d have two diametrically opposed possible solutions, and I would bring them to him, and I’d be like, ‘Is it A or B?’ And he’d look at it and be like, ‘It’s definitely B,’ and the problem would never come back.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a few years of this, Hodak took what he’d learned and roped in three former Neuralink colleagues to launch Science Corp. about four years ago. Like Altman, Hodak describes his team’s improbable goal so placidly that I find myself believing the limits of cognition are about to be overcome sooner than most of us realize. And that he’ll be among those who make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While I’ve been consumed with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/your-ai-tools-run-on-fracked-gas-and-bulldozed-texas-land/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI data center craziness</a> and the talent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/sam-altman-says-meta-tried-and-failed-to-poach-openais-talent-with-100m-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">poaching wars</a>, momentum has been building in the background.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to World Economic Forum data, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/06/the-brain-computer-interface-market-is-growing-but-what-are-the-risks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nearly 700</a> companies around the world have at least some ties to brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, including some tech giants. In addition to Neuralink, ​​Microsoft Research has run a dedicated BCI project for the last seven years. Apple <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250804537175/en/Synchron-Debuts-First-Thought-Controlled-iPad-Experience-Using-Apples-New-BCI-Human-Interface-Device-Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnered</a> earlier this year with <a href=\"https://synchron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Synchron</a>, backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, to create a protocol that lets BCIs control iPhones and iPads. Even Altman is reportedly helping to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/sam-altman-openai-will-reportedly-back-a-startup-that-takes-on-musks-neuralink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stand up</a> a Neuralink rival.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And in August, China released its “Implementation Plan for Promoting Innovation and Development of the BCI Industry,” targeting core technological breakthroughs by 2027, and aiming to become the global leader by 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the neuroscience isn’t new. “A legitimate criticism of the BCI companies is that they aren’t doing new neuroscience,” Hodak said. “Decoding cursor control or robotic arm control from a human — people have been doing that for 30 years.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s new, however, is the engineering. “The innovation at Neuralink is making [a device] small enough and low-power enough that you can fully implant it and close the skin, and have something that isn’t an infection risk. That genuinely was new.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, Hodak admits we’re missing a lot of information about how the brain works to really build the products that he’s talking about. But unlike a lot of BCI companies that have to raise money, Science Corp. — which has so far secured $260 million — is figuring out ways to generate revenue. On a small scale, it makes tools that it then sells to other researchers — as Hodak puts it, “taking a $300,000 cart-sized recording system and turning it into a $2,000 handheld.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger unlock is getting something to market soon. A product that can help people and make money while the company quietly builds technology that it claims could reshape human consciousness itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That initial commercial “product” is a procedure called Prima. It’s exciting enough that Time magazine <a href=\"https://time.com/7330887/brain-computer-chips-future-of-medicine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">put the tech on its cover</a> a few weeks ago: a computer chip smaller than a grain of rice that’s implanted directly in the retina. Combined with camera-equipped glasses and (for the time being) a two-pound battery, the tech restores vision to people with advanced macular degeneration. Not blurry, vague light perception, but “form vision.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In completed clinical trials with 38 patients, Science Corp. says 80% were able to read again, two letters at a time. “To my knowledge, this is the first time that restoration of the ability to fluently read has ever been definitively shown in blind patients,” says Hodak.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Science Corp. can only take so much credit. It <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240425683676/en/Science-Corporation-Acquires-Pixiums-PRIMA-Retinal-Implant-Extending-and-Diversifying-Its-Commitment-to-Vision-Restoration-Through-Brain-Computer-Interface-Technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquired</a> Prima from a French company called Pixium Vision last year, refined the technology, completed the trials Pixium had started, and submitted the results for approval in Europe. Hodak expects to launch the product next summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prima is meanwhile still to be approved by U.S. regulators. Asked about the FDA, Hodak said, “We’re working with the FDA, although there’s some questions on exactly the timeline for that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, at what he estimates will cost $200,000 per procedure at the outset, Science Corp. will become profitable if it manages to get just 50 patients per month.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073240\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-mind-in-a-dish-of-neurons\">The mind in a dish of neurons</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The next, more ambitious step is gene therapy. Specifically, optogenetic gene therapy, which means making neurons light-sensitive so they can be controlled with light instead of electrodes. It’s not a new idea, but Science Corp. thinks it’s figured out what everyone else hasn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s how Prima works: Your retina has three layers of cells. Photoreceptors (rods and cones) at the back capture light and connect to bipolar cells, which connect to optic nerves that run to the brain. In macular degeneration, the photoreceptors die. Prima’s 400 electrodes stimulate the bipolar cells directly, bypassing the dead layer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With gene therapy, the goal is to skip the electrodes entirely. Instead, you engineer the surviving cells using new proteins to respond to light. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The eye is a really ideal place to do this type of gene therapy work, because it’s kind of left alone by the immune system,” Hodak explains. In other parts of the body, engineered cells that express unfamiliar proteins trigger immune attacks. But our body learned long ago not to overreact when things change in the eye.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies are pursuing similar approaches, but Hodak says they are either targeting the wrong cell layer, or their proteins just aren’t as good as his startup’s. “They’re not as fast, they’re not as sensitive. The proteins that we’re actually using are state of the art,” he claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, even gene therapy isn’t the long game. The long game is something Hodak has probably been dreaming about his entire life: a way to grow new brain tissue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Electrodes are crude; they damage tissue. “Every time you place something mechanically into the brain, there’s no free space in there,” Hodak explains. He says there’s redundancy in the cortex, and for someone with a spinal cord injury or blindness, the trade-off is “totally justifiable.” But the tissue damage means “you can’t scale it up to millions or billions of channels.” That, he says, is the fundamental limitation of approaches like Neuralink’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adding more neurons to the brain sounds batty, but Science Corp. says it has already tested a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/brain-computer-interface-2671151260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">proof-of-concept device</a> in mice. The device looks like a tiny waffle grid and sits on the brain’s surface (instead of being pushed inside), with each well containing engineered neurons grown from stem cells. The neurons are heavily modified, optimized for specific functions. Once the waffle-like device is installed, the neurons begin growing new connections — axons and dendrites — down into the brain tissue, forming biological links with existing neural circuits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At least in the tests with mice, Science Corp. says it demonstrated that these additional neurons worked some of the time: Five of nine mice learned to move left or right when the device was activated.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It does this in a perfectly bio-compatible way, because the brain is really just a bunch of neurons,” Hodak said. Just neurons talking to neurons, the way evolution intended, save for the not-inconsiderable fact that some of the neurons come from a lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What if something goes wrong? A patient “can take a vitamin, an FDA-approved thing that you wouldn’t otherwise take,” and the engineered neurons will die, Hodak says, describing it as a valve built into the biology itself.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-hodak-really-wants\">What Hodak really wants</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve been talking for a while when Hodak reframes everything in one sentence. “I actually think BCI is a longevity-adjacent story.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The brain does two things,” he starts. “The brain is intelligent and it’s conscious. We know that intelligence is substrate-independent, because you get it in both brains and GPUs. But the end of the brain-computer interface quest, I think, is actually conscious machines.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is about cracking consciousness itself; understanding the physical laws that make subjective experience possible, and then engineering it into new substrates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In order to prove a theory of consciousness is right, you have to see it for yourself,” Hodak explains. “That will require these big brain-computer interfaces.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hodak thinks that once humans understand how billions of neurons bind together to create a unified experience — what neuroscientists call “the binding problem” — we can start doing truly wild things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I almost hesitate to say some of those wild things include multiple brains working to form one consciousness. “You could really, in a very fundamental sense, talk about redrawing the border around a brain, possibly to include four hemispheres, or a device, or a whole group of people,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hodak is basically describing the plot of “Pluribus,” the new Apple TV show where an alien signal transforms humanity into a hive mind. It’s dystopian as hell. But Hodak seems to think the basic science is … sound.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Will there be some giant super organisms that correspond to world cultures? Will there be dyads, like the next step up in marriage?” He’s genuinely uncertain how the technology will be used. “It’s kind of tough to imagine how it will get used, but I’m pretty confident those devices will get built.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basically, at the end of this path, you don’t have simply smarter humans; you have people who’ve merged with machines, with each other. Consciousness that spans multiple substrates, bodies, and minds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You could cure cancer, you could cure cardiovascular disease, you could cure all metabolic disease,” Hodak says. “But there’s this alternative view of substrate independence that just basically says, what if we didn’t need to solve those problems in the first place?” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What if, instead of endlessly patching failing bodies, we just moved the consciousness somewhere else?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-tipping-point\">The tipping point</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What makes this conversation remarkable is how concrete everything sounds. Hodak isn’t hand-waving about “someday.” He’s got timelines, patient numbers, and regulatory pathways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By 2035, [biohybrid neural interfaces] will be basically available for patients in need,” he says. “And that will start to really deform the world in interesting ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, Hodak isn’t saying healthy 40-year-olds will be lining up for brain surgery anytime soon. “These are [for] very serious brain surgeries,” he emphasizes. He does say that because people invariably age, “many people eventually become patients.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, he claims the technology will improve, surgeries will get safer, and benefits will become more dramatic. And gradually, the patient population will expand. By the late 2040s — which is not so far away — Hodak thinks the tech will be “really ubiquitous.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2035 is when things are expected to get weird. That’s when, Hodak predicts, “patient number one gets the choice of like, ‘You can die of pancreatic cancer, or you can be inserted into the matrix and then it will accelerate from there.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He tells a room full of people that in a decade, someone facing terminal illness might choose to have their consciousness uploaded and somehow preserved through BCI technology. The people in the room look both entertained and concerned.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-money-money-money\">Money, money, money</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One thing that seems unlikely to change is that a small minority of people will have vast financial resources while the rest don’t. Currently, insurance covers treatments for macular degeneration patients. But as BCIs proliferate and improve, the entire economic model of healthcare may break down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hodak’s argument is that consumer tech has good deflation. Phones and computers get better and cheaper, so we buy more of them and spend more money; the market expands. But healthcare operates on what Hodak calls “a fixed bucket of money.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The theory is that as BCI technology presumably improves and extends lives, there will be more things to spend healthcare dollars on. “The problem is that as new technologies come along that produce better outcomes and longer lives, there’s more stuff to spend money on for better outcomes,” Hodak says. “You can’t spend like 10 times as much on healthcare. This would be a catastrophe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That is like a fundamental conflict that I think is going to eventually break the healthcare system as these technologies actually work in big ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Honestly, at this point in the conversation, healthcare costs are far from top of my mind. But it’s an important point: either healthcare spending balloons to unsustainable levels, or whether someone gets a BCI is a matter of whether they can afford it. I can’t believe that class divisions based on cognitive enhancements seem like an actual, near-term economic reality, but imagine trying to compete against someone with perfect recall, or the ability to calculate something instantaneously. That would suck.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As our time is running out, I ask Hodak what he thinks might happen to society. He doesn’t have answers. I ask him about the potential for hacking. “I worry a lot more about Twitter than I do about these things,” he says with a smile, adding that he’s more concerned about information manipulation through our eyes than through direct brain interfaces.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I leave the conversation thinking again about “Pluribus,” which Hodak is yet to watch. In the show, the hive mind offers everything: perfect knowledge, freedom from loneliness, complete understanding. But once you’re in, you’re not you anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I also think about how Altman’s comment, that he’d just ask the AI, tickled a room full of people because it sounded absurd to those outside that field.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Years ago, as a junior reporter in Silicon Valley, I had the same initial response to many ambitious ideas and products. A lot of those ideas have now taken over the world, so now I just listen and wait.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company instead wants to concentrate on helping stores “achieve operational efficiency, improved margins and visibility,” he said, citing this as its primary objective. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/04/walmart-backed-fintech-giant-phonepe-makes-e-commerce-push/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched</a> Pincode in April 2023 as a major push into e-commerce, building it on the Indian government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The hyperlocal app offered groceries, medicines, food, electronics, and home décor from neighborhood shops. It rolled out first in Bengaluru and later expanded to other cities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within a little over a year of launch, Pincode <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/phonepes-pincode-exits-non-food-categories-in-ecommerce-business-rejig/articleshow/109557723.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pulled out of most categories</a> except food. Earlier this year, the app <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/phonepe-sharpens-quick-commerce-play-in-first-for-a-payments-company/articleshow/117213550.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shifted to a quick-commerce model</a>, offering 10-minute deliveries through local kirana shops and retailers in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. The company also expanded the service to 10-minute medicine deliveries in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Pune in April.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe’s Pincode utilized local shops and retail stores for its quick deliveries — a contrast to rivals like Swiggy, Zomato-owned Blinkit, and Zepto, which rely on dark stores. The shift did not help Pincode gain ground in the crowded segment, prompting PhonePe to wind down the service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pincode was not PhonePe’s first move into e-commerce. In 2019, the company <a href=\"https://www.phonepe.com/press/launching-phonepe-switch-your-shortcut-to-a-world-of-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched “Switch,”</a> a super-app layer inside its payments app that offered access to food, grocery, shopping, and travel services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe has now shut down the Pincode app and <a href=\"https://www.pincode.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">redirected its website</a> to PhonePe’s main site. The company said it will now focus on working with offline retailers by expanding its B2B offerings. In July, PhonePe said it had digitized over 1,000 local stores across Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Varanasi through Pincode, giving them access to digital storefronts, inventory tools, and last-mile delivery services.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As part of this strategic decision, we will now focus the entire Pincode team’s resources towards accelerating the build-out and scale-up of a suite of B2B business solutions for offline businesses across India,” Vivek Lohcheb, CEO of Pincode, said in a prepared statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe already offers inventory and order-management tools, as well as other ERP software for small businesses, and provides direct sourcing and replenishment services in some categories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift comes as PhonePe prepares for a public listing in India, nearly three years after its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/flipkart-and-phonepe-complete-separation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spin-off from Flipkart</a>. The company <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/walmart-backed-phonepe-files-india-ipo-via-confidential-route-2025-09-24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed draft papers</a> with the Securities and Exchange Board of India through the confidential pre-filing route in September and is targeting a mid-2026 listing. PhonePe is also looking for ways to grow beyond its position as the country’s dominant payments app on the Unified Payments Interface.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe did not respond to detailed questions about Pincode’s performance and the timing of the app’s shutdown.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/04/30/chicago-tribune-sues-openai-microsoft/\">that sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material: eight sued in April and another nine <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/28/openai-microsoft-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sued</a> in November.

And the singular message, amid a deluge of product news and keynotes, was AI for the enterprise. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year it was all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels capped off the final night with a keynote aimed at lifting up developers and assuaging any fears that AI is coming for engineering jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AWS re:Invent 2025</a>, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. <br><br>“We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent. Be sure to check back.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-werner-out\">Werner out …</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon CTO Werner Vogels had the closing keynote of the conference — and it looks like this will be his last one. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is my final re:Invent keynote,” he said, then quickly added he is not leaving the company. “I’m not leaving Amazon or anything like that, but I think that after 14 re:Invents you guys are owed young, fresh, new voices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vogels then spent more than an hour talking to a packed room before ending with a “Werner, out” and a literal mic drop. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-will-ai-take-your-job\">Will AI take your job? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vogels spent much of the closing keynote talking about AI and its role in the future, including the looming threat that it will take away jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Will AI take my job? Maybe,” Vogels asked and answered, before noting that some tasks will be automated, and some skills will become obsolete. “So maybe we should rephrase and reframe this question. Will AI make me obsolete? Absolutely not, if you evolve.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-next-gen-cpu\">Next-gen CPU</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-graviton-5-cpu-amazon-ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unveiled</a> its Graviton5 CPU on Thursday, the next-generation chip that the company promises will be its highest performing, most efficient yet. The Graviton5 contains 192 processor cores, a dense and efficient design that AWS says reduces the distance data must travel between cores. That helps cut inter-core communication latency by up to 33% while increasing bandwidth, the company said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-doubling-down-on-llms\">Doubling down on LLMs</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced more tools for enterprise customers to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/aws-doubles-down-on-custom-llms-with-features-meant-to-simplify-model-creation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create their own models</a>. Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier. <br><br>For instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure. The serverless model customization can be accessed through either a self-guided path or by prompting an AI agent.<br><br>AWS also announced Reinforcement Fine Tuning in Bedrock, which allows developers to choose a preset workflow or reward system and have Bedrock run their customization process automatically from start to finish.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-andy-jassy-shares-some-numbers\">Andy Jassy shares some numbers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took to social media platform X to expound on AWS chief Matt Garman’s keynote speech. The message: The current generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip Trainium2 is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/andy-jassy-says-amazons-nvidia-competitor-chip-is-already-a-multi-billion-dollar-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">already bringing in loads of cash</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His comments were tied to the reveal of its next-generation chip, Trainium3, and meant to forecast a promising revenue future for the product.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-database-savings-arrives\">Database savings arrives</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tucked among the dozens of announcements is one item that is already getting cheers: Discounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specifically, AWS said it was launching Database Savings Plans, which help customers reduce database costs by up to 35% when they commit to a consistent amount of usage ($/hour) over a one-year term. The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.duckbillhq.com/blog/aws-database-savings-plans-six-years-of-complaining-finally-pays-off/\">in his blog post</a>, “Six years of complaining finally pays off.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-t-get-a-better-deal-than-free-amazon-hopes\">Can’t get a better deal than free, Amazon hopes  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Is there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year’s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/amazon-hopes-to-jump-start-its-ai-coding-tool-kiro-by-giving-it-away-to-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+</a> to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-training-chip-and-nvidia-compatibility\">An AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS introduced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new version of its AI training chip</a> called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expanded-agentcore-capabilities\">Expanded AgentCore capabilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-announces-new-capabilities-for-its-ai-agent-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform</a>. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-nonstop-ai-agent-worker-bee\">A nonstop AI agent worker bee</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-nova-models-and-services\">New Nova models and services</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-launches-new-nova-ai-models-and-a-service-that-gives-customers-more-control/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">four new AI models</a> within its Nova AI model family — three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS’s big pitch is flexibility and customization.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lyft-s-argument-for-ai-agents\">Lyft’s argument for AI agents</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/aws-and-lyft-bringing-agentic-ai-to-life-for-riders-and-drivers\">piped up during the event</a> to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-factory-for-the-private-data-center\">An AI Factory for the private data center</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced “AI Factories”</a> that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" id=\"youtube-iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PwnFQypXuY?si=VstFHIC-23XfS2y2&amp;autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.
