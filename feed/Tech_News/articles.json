For the U.S. market, OpenAI’s ChatGPT topped the ranks of free iPhone apps (not including games) with the most installs in 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI app was followed by Threads, Google, TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail and then Google’s Gemini.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT made it to No. 4 last year, but the top spot was taken by Chinese shopping app Temu. In 2023, the AI app didn’t make the top-ten list despite being released on the iPhone in May 2023 to a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/chatgpts-new-app-comes-out-of-the-gate-hot-tops-half-a-million-installs-in-first-6-days/\">strong</a> debut.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that ChatGPT is outpacing social networking standbys, and much-needed utilities like Google Maps indicates how deeply AI has penetrated people’s everyday lives here in the U.S. It also demonstrates the potential for OpenAI to disrupt Google’s tight hold on the search market on mobile devices, as more people turn to a chatbot for answers first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were signs that ChatGPT was on its way to No. 1 earlier in the year — it became the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/chatgpt-became-the-most-downloaded-app-globally-in-march/\">most-downloaded app globally in March</a>, outpacing other top apps like TikTok and Instagram.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple also released its list of the top paid apps, the top free and paid games for iPhone and iPad, as well as the top Apple Arcade games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Block Blast! was the top free game this year, while Minecraft took the crown as the top paid game. On iPad, YouTube was the No. 1 free app, and users downloaded the creativity app Procreate as the top paid game on iPad. Roblox was the top free iPad game.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The full list of top apps and games is below:</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-top-free-iphone-apps\"><strong>Top Free iPhone Apps</strong></h2>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">ChatGPT</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Threads</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Google</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">TikTok – Videos, Shop &amp;

The e-commerce giant says it will expand the service to additional cities in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon first launched the ability to order perishable items via Same-Day Delivery <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/amazon-rolls-out-same-day-delivery-of-perishable-groceries-in-1000-us-cities/\">in August</a>, a move that was seen as a way for the company to compete more directly with Instacart and Walmart+ in the quick-commerce space.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launch, customers have ordered fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods, and frozen foods alongside electronics, books, pantry staples and snacks, and everyday household essentials like paper towels and toothpaste.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says its “specialized temperature-controlled fulfillment network” ensures that shoppers receive perishable groceries intact, and that orders undergo a six-point quality check upon arrival and before leaving for delivery. Plus, temperature-sensitive products are delivered in insulated bags.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fresh groceries now make up nine of the top ten most-ordered items for fast delivery, Amazon says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The top bestsellers for Same-Day Delivery are bananas, Haas avocados, strawberries, honeycrisp apples, limes, blueberries, blackberries, organic bananas, navel oranges, and bathroom tissues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also notes that perishable grocery sales have grown 30 times since January, and that customers who add fresh groceries to their Same-Day Delivery orders shop about twice as often as those who don’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Same-day delivery is free for orders worth more than $25 for Prime members. If an order doesn’t meet the minimum amount, subscribers can still choose same-day delivery for a $2.99 fee. For customers without a Prime membership, the service is available with a $12.99 fee, regardless of the order size.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says it has grown its perishable selection available for Same-Day Delivery by over 30% since August, and has included thousands of popular items from Whole Foods Market.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round also saw investments from individuals such as Adam D’Angelo, Garry Tan, Lenny Rachitsky, Mati Staniszewski, Mikey Shulman, Jared Hecht, and M.G. Siegler.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That platform, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/after-selling-to-spotify-anchors-co-founders-are-back-with-oboe-an-ai-powered-app-for-learning/\">which officially launched in September</a>, allows users to define a learning goal and use AI to create a course for them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s fundraise comes three months after the app’s launch and a year after it raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/after-selling-anchor-to-spotify-co-founders-reunite-to-build-ai-educational-startup-oboe/\">a $4 million seed round</a>. Zicherman said the reason behind the fresh round is to fuel growth at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to reach billions of people who want to learn about new topics, and it is a very big opportunity,”  he told TechCrunch over a call. “We need to execute faster and reach a larger audience at scale to achieve this vision.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a team of successful consumer product builders that can execute well, which gives us an edge over other startups in the market,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bryan Kim, a partner at a16z, said that he was impressed by how fast Oboe started generating content on a topic and didn’t make users wait behind a loading indicator. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have had a thesis around how AI-aided learning can help people explore new topics and have been looking for the right company. After Oboe launched, we tried it and loved the product. We wanted to back a founder who was ambitious, flexible in adopting different form factors, and understood AI to build a big platform. We found that in Oboe,” he told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is making changes to its core course generation experience, as well. Earlier, Oboe generated different text and audio formats for users in different styles. Plus, it capped course generation based on the payment plan.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Image describing screenshots of Oboe's new chapter focused learning course generation.\" class=\"wp-image-3074609\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog2.0-ChapterList.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Oboe</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new version, the app will first understand your goal and then generate chapters based on that to help you learn about those topics.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI agents are being sold as the solution for planning trips, answering business questions, and solving problems of all kinds, but getting them to work with tools and data outside their chat interfaces has been tricky. Developers have to patch together various connectors and keep them running, but that’s a fragile approach that’s hard to scale and creates governance headaches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google claims it’s trying to solve that by launching its own fully managed, remote MCP servers that would make its Google and Cloud services — like Maps and BigQuery — easier for agents to plug into.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move follows the launch of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">Google’s latest Gemini 3 model</a>, and the company is looking to pair stronger reasoning with more dependable connections to real-world tools and data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are making Google agent-ready by design,” Steren Giannini, product management director at Google Cloud, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of spending a week or two setting up connectors, developers can now essentially paste in a URL to a managed endpoint, Giannini said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, Google is starting with MCP servers for Maps, BigQuery, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes Engine. In practice, this might look like an analytics assistant querying BigQuery directly, or an ops agent interacting with infrastructure services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Maps, Giannini said, without the MCP, developers would rely on the model’s built-in knowledge. “But by giving your agent […] a tool like the Google Maps MCP server, then it gets grounded on actual, up-to-date location information for places or trips planning,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the MCP servers will eventually be offered across all of Google’s tools, they are initially launching under public preview, meaning they’re not yet fully covered by Google Cloud terms of service. They are, however, being offered to enterprise customers that already pay for Google services at no extra cost. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect to bring them to general availability very soon in the new year,” Giannini said, adding that he expects more MCP servers to trickle in every week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MCP, which stands for Model Context Protocol, was developed by Anthropic about a year ago as an open-source standard to connect AI systems with data and tools. The protocol has been widely adopted across the agent tooling world, and Anthropic earlier this week <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/openai-anthropic-and-block-join-new-linux-foundation-effort-to-standardize-the-ai-agent-era/\">donated MCP to a new Linux Foundation fund</a> dedicated to open-sourcing and standardizing AI agent infrastructure. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The beauty of MCP is that, because it’s a standard, if Google provides a server, it can connect to any client,” Giannini said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how many more clients will emerge.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One can think of MCP clients as the AI apps on the other end of the wire that talk to MCP servers and call the tools they offer. For Google, that includes Gemini CLI and AI Studio. Giannini said he’s also tried it with Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT as clients, and “they just work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google argues this isn’t just about connecting agents to its services. The bigger enterprise play is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/google-cloud-launches-apigee-x-the-next-generation-of-its-api-management-platform/\">Apigee, its API management product</a>, which many companies already use to issue API keys, set quotas, and monitor traffic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Giannini said Apigee can essentially “translate” a standard API into an MCP server, turning endpoints like a product catalog API into tools an agent can discover and use, with<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/24/apigee-rolls-out-new-ai-powered-api-protection-features/\"> existing security and governance controls</a> layered on top. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, the same API guardrails companies use for human-built apps could now apply to AI agents, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s new MCP servers are protected by a permission mechanism called Google Cloud IAM, which explicitly protects what an agent can do with that server. They are also protected by Google Cloud Model Armor, which Giannini describes as a firewall dedicated to agentic workloads that defends against advanced agentic threats like prompt injection and data exfiltration. Administrators can also rely on audit logging for additional observability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google plans to expand MCP support beyond the initial set of servers. In the next few months, the company will roll out support for services across areas like storage, databases, logging and monitoring, and security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We built the plumbing so that developers don’t have to,” Giannini said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He also confirmed the startup is in M&amp;A talks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s edtech landscape has fractured since the pandemic, when the sector saw a rare moment of opportunity during the lockdowns. Startups like Unacademy and Byju’s raised billions, hired freely, and invested heavily in sales and marketing to draw customers, but growth stalled after the lockdowns eased and students went back to offline classes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Byju’s, India’s most valuable startup just three years ago, has seen its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/byjus-founder-says-his-edtech-startup-once-worth-22b-is-now-worth-zero/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">valuation written down to effectively zero</a>, and it entered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/second-byjus-auditor-exits-in-a-year-as-financial-turmoil-deepens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">insolvency proceedings</a> in September last year. In November, a U.S. bankruptcy court ordered its founder Byju Raveendran to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/22/byjus-founder-to-appeal-u-s-court-order-to-pay-over-1b-in-bankruptcy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pay more than $1.07 billion</a> for ignoring court directives, and providing “evasive, incomplete” responses related to the transfer of $533 million by the startup’s U.S. unit that it never recovered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Physics Wallah, long considered the underdog, has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-physicswallah-shares-jump-5-after-q2fy26-results-from-70-profit-jump-in-q2-to-big-ai-bet-5-key-highlights-4070625/\">turned profitable</a> and continued to expand, and last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/physics-wallah-enjoys-a-rosy-ipo-day-bucking-the-broader-slowdown-in-indian-edtech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">had a strong public-market debut</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his note, Unacademy’s Munjal saw the last three years were marked by shrinking demand, intensifying competition, and internal turmoil as the startup suffered losses and abandoned aggressive expansion plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Personally, for us founders, this was the most difficult three years that we had ever seen in our lives because until 2021, we had not seen a single month of degrowth [sic],” he wrote. “But in the last three years, we saw losing market share in the game that we literally invented and it hurt.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Munjal believes the slump was driven by a rapid shift in market dynamics after the pandemic. As students moved back to offline classrooms and competitors launched lower-priced offerings modeled on Unacademy’s early strategy, the company saw demand decline and growth stagnate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We got complacent,” he wrote, adding that the firm failed to innovate on price even as rivals undercut it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In recent months, Munjal has devoted increasing attention to AirLearn, his new AI-first language learning app that imitates Duolingo’s gamified approach. That shift has created friction with some Unacademy investors, who felt the core edtech business was being left adrift during a difficult phase, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2015, Unacademy has raised about $854.3 million over 13 funding rounds, according to PitchBook, and counts SoftBank, Tiger Global, General Atlantic, and Peak XV Partners among its backers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Munjal said Unacademy has spent the past two years overhauling its operations, slashing its annual burn from ₹14 billion (around $155.7 million) in 2022 to less than ₹1.75 billion (approximately $19.5 million) this year. The startup has significantly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/indian-edtech-unacademy-cuts-another-250-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reduced headcount through layoffs</a>, cut marketing costs, and refocused on its core subscription business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recent reports have suggested that rival UpGrad has discussed acquiring Unacademy for <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/ronnie-screwvalas-upgrad-in-talks-to-acquire-unacademy-for-300-400-million-13657880.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">between $300 and $400 million</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Founder and CEO Hassaan Raza said that many people are engaging with the platform frequently, spending hours chatting with AI Santa and often reaching their daily limits.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Last year’s AI Santa drew millions of hits, and we’re on pace to surpass that by a wide margin as Christmas approaches,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this level of engagement marks a milestone for Tavus, it also raises questions about the impact of such interactions, especially for young children. Children may struggle to distinguish between AI and a real person. Spending hours in conversation with an AI has already been linked to negative effects in adults, making the potential effects on children who strongly believe in Santa a concern for some parents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During our testing, there were subtle cues that the AI Santa does yet appear fully human-like, such as long pauses and a flat voice. We also found that if a user were to question whether it’s real, the programmed response was: “I’m an AI Santa powered by Tavus’ magic and technology. I might not be the physical Santa, but I’ve got the spirit and the cheer.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the experience launches amid growing concerns about AI’s effects on young users. There have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\">reports</a> linking chatbot interactions to serious harm, including cases where chatbots were implicated in the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/lawsuit-blames-character-ai-in-death-of-14-year-old-boy/\">suicide deaths</a> of teenagers.

Safety features, such as content filters, have been implemented to maintain family-friendly discussions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In certain situations, conversations can be terminated, and users are directed to mental health resources if necessary. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The vast majority of interactions have been family-friendly and true to the Santa experience,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, when asked about data collection, Raza said the company “collects logs, session timestamps, metadata, and other information users choose to share during their chats. This data is used to provide and maintain a safe experience, and users can request data deletion at any point in time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It added that generation models like Nano Banana are good for creating images, but users often need granular tools for editing that work without any text prompts. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma has improved its lasso tool for selection. Now you can use it to select an object, remove it, or isolate it to move it around. When you move around the object, the image still retains other characteristics, such as background and color. Users can also select an object to adjust factors like lighting, shadow, color, or focus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also bringing an image expansion feature to its design suite. This feature is handy when you are adjusting a creative for a particular format and need to fill in the background or other details. For instance, creating a web banner or mobile banner from a 1×1 image. It essentially saves you from constantly cropping an image and adjusting elements within it. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ezgif-8bda4c8d57256f21.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074654\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Figma</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides adding these features, Figma is collating all its image editing tools in one toolbar for easier access. You can select objects or parts of images, change background color, and add annotations or text using this toolbar. The company said removing background is one of the most common actions on the platform, and that is why it is getting a prominent spot on the new toolbar. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivals like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/adobe-makes-selecting-and-deleting-objects-and-people-in-photoshop-and-lightroom-a-lot-easier/\">Adobe</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/22/canva-new-features-including-suite-of-ai-powered-tools/\">Canva</a> have had object removal for a few years now. Figma is finally catching up to offer these features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said the new image editing features are available on Figma Design and Draw, with plans to make them available across Figma tools next year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma’s launch comes on the same day as Adobe <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/adobe-brings-photoshop-express-and-acrobat-features-to-chatgpt/\">making some of these features available to users within ChatGPT</a>. Figma was one of the launch partners of the app, calling on ChatGPT in October. It is not clear if these new functions will be available to users using Figma within OpenAI’s tool. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At least one customer record was exposed and indexed by Google, allowing anyone to find the data by searching for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The customer records, seen by TechCrunch, included visit summaries, medical histories, and prescription and vaccination records, among other files relating to Vetco customers and their pets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The files also contained customer names; their home address, email address, and phone number; the location of the Vetco clinic where the services were performed; medical assessments, tests and diagnoses; and the costs of goods, names of veterinarians, consent forms, owner signatures, and dates of service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We also found animal names, species and breed, their sex, age and date of birth, their microchip number (if registered), their medical vitals, and prescription records in the files.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch alerted Petco to the security lapse on Friday after discovering the vulnerability. The company acknowledged the data exposure days later on the following Tuesday after TechCrunch followed-up by attaching several exposed customer files to our email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera told TechCrunch late on Tuesday that the company has “implemented, and will continue to implement, additional measures to further strengthen the security of our systems,” though the company did not provide evidence for the claim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Olvera would not say if the company has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if any data was extracted from the company’s systems during the course of the data spill.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-techcrunch-found-the-data-spill\">How TechCrunch found the data spill</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch identified a vulnerability in how Vetco’s website generates copies of PDF documents for its customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vetco’s customer portal, located at <code>petpass.com</code>, allows customers to log in and obtain veterinary records and other documents relating to their pet’s care. But TechCrunch found that the PDF generating page on Vetco’s website was public, and not protected with a password.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As such, it was possible for anyone on the internet to access sensitive customer files directly from Vetco’s servers by modifying the web address to input a customer’s unique identification number. Vetco customer numbers are sequential, which means one could access other customers’ data simply by changing a customer number by one or two digits. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch checked at intervals of 100,000 customers to determine how many records may have been exposed in total. The sequential customer numbers suggest that millions of Petco customers’ information could have been retrieved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bug is classed as an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/cisa-nsa-australia-idor-flaws/\">insecure direct object reference</a> (or IDOR), a common lapse in security practices  that allows unfettered access to files on a server because there aren’t proper checks in place to make sure the person accessing the data is permitted to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how long these customer records have been left exposed, but the customer record listed on Google was dated mid-2020.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-third-petco-breach-this-year\">Third Petco breach this year</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By TechCrunch’s count, this is Petco’s third data breach in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, hackers associated with the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters hacking collective <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/hacking-group-claims-theft-of-1-billion-records-from-salesforce-customer-databases/\">allegedly stole reams of data</a> from a database of customer information that Petco hosts with cloud giant Salesforce. The hackers demanded victim companies pay a ransom to not have their information leaked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, Petco <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/petco-confirms-security-lapse-exposed-customers-personal-data/\">disclosed a second data breach</a> involving a security issue that the company said it discovered on its own. Petco blamed the data leak on “a setting within one of our software applications that inadvertently allowed certain files to be accessible online,” but did not provide specific details of the incident. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/petcos-security-lapse-affected-customers-ssns-drivers-licenses-and-more/\">data breach included sensitive customer information</a>, such as Social Security numbers, driver’s licenses, and financial information, including debit and credit card numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Olvera declined to say how many people are affected by the September incident, but California law requires companies to disclose data breaches publicly when the number of victims in the state crosses 500 people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch believes this latest data leak involving Vetco is a separate security incident, given that Petco began notifying its customers of the previous data leak several months ago.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Last year, Fervo raised nearly $500 million in equity and debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enhanced geothermal has been in development for years but has recently soared as favorable conditions have lifted its prospects. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chief among them is rising data center demand. Large tech companies like Google and Meta have been eyeing geothermal as a potential solution to their energy needs. Earlier this year, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that by 2030, enhanced geothermal could provide <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/geothermal-could-power-nearly-all-new-data-centers-through-2030/\">nearly two-thirds of new data center demand</a> at or below what operators are paying today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geothermal is also viewed favorably within the Trump administration. Energy secretary Chris Wright’s previous company, Liberty Energy, participated in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/trumps-pro-fracking-energy-secretary-pick-has-also-invested-in-geothermal-and-nuclear-startups/\">$138 million round</a> that Fervo raised in 2022. Like many of its peers, the company uses fracking and directional drilling techniques borrowed from the oil and gas industry. Many Fervo employees used to work in oil and gas, applying their knowledge of drilling and subsurface development to a new challenge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fervo is considered a frontrunner among enhanced geothermal startups, which drill deeper than existing geothermal developers to tap hotter rocks and deliver more power.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That knowledge has helped Fervo bring down the time it takes to drill a new well. The company’s first wells took about a month, but this summer, Fervo announced that it had completed one in 16 days. “We are in the mid-teens these days, on average, for our well drilling times,” Jewett said. “That is pretty good, but we always have more improvements to make.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s obsession with drilling time is both economic and a point of pride. “Roughly half the cost of wells is in the drilling time,” Jewett said. Shorter drilling times mean that Fervo can complete power plants more quickly, bringing in revenue sooner. They’re also a sign of mastery. “It’s also a good representation of how much you’re investing in the well, how much you’re troubleshooting, how many issues are plaguing you that end up costing money,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Fervo is focused on the Western U.S., where hot rocks sit closer to the surface. At the company’s Cape Station site in Utah, for example, Fervo has to drill down 8,500 feet to tap into 450˚ F rock. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you go to Pennsylvania or West Virginia, [the hot rock] exists much lower,” Jewett said. Only after the company is comfortable with how quickly it can drill a well in the West will it expand elsewhere, including abroad.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are a lot of really high-potential places across the world,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the U.S., though, there are plenty of different types of rock for Fervo to drill through, giving it the potential to build up sufficient technical experience before heading to other countries. By that point, Jewett expects that differences in regulations will be the primary hurdle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given skyrocketing energy demand from data centers and Fervo’s progress at Cape Station, there have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/geothermal-unicorn-fervo-energy-may-ipo-as-early-as-next-year/\">rumors</a> that the company might file for go public in the coming year or so. Jewett wouldn’t comment on those, but she said that the company is seeing “off-the-charts demand.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/softbank-stays-in-as-meesho-606m-ipo-becomes-indias-first-major-e-commerce-listing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$606 million in the IPO</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">10-year-old Meesho was last valued at about $5 billion following a private funding round in 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elevation Capital, Peak XV Partners and Y Combinator were among the early shareholders who have sold their stakes in the IPO. Investors including SoftBank, Prosus and Fidelity haven’t sold any shares yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2015, Meesho started off as WhatsApp-based social-commerce platform for first-time online shoppers. It has managed to compete successfully with incumbents like Flipkart and Amazon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/meesho-claims-indian-e-commerce-first-with-positive-cash-flow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">by leaning into a low-cost marketplace model</a> aimed at connecting small merchants with price-sensitive consumers across smaller towns in the country. In the past 12 months, it reported 234.2 million transacting users, 706,471 annual sellers, and over 50,000 active content creators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ringing the bell generally means trading,” said Meesho co-founder and CEO Vidit Aatrey during the public listing ceremony. “But today, for me at Meesho, for everyone at Meesho, this ringing basically means that our mission is not just our mission. Now it’s everyone’s mission.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the six months ended September 30, Meesho generated revenue of ₹55.78 billion (approximately $620.3 million), up from ₹43.11 billion (around $479.6 million) a year earlier, according to its prospectus. Net merchandise value rose 44% to ₹191.94 billion (about $2.14 billion) in the same period. However, the company’s losses widened to ₹4.33 billion (roughly $48.2 million), compared with ₹0.24 billion (around $2.7 million) a year earlier.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based company compares itself to other value-driven marketplaces like Pinduoduo in China, Shopee in Southeast Asia, and Mercado Libre in Latin America.

Inito allows women to measure estrogen, LH, progesterone (PdG), and FSH on a single test strip. Inito’s AI models interpret these levels to reveal fertility hormone patterns, track fertile days, and confirm ovulation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast forward to today, the startup has become a popular option for women looking to track fertility hormones, analyzing more than 30 million fertility hormone data points since 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is now doubling down on its belief that healthcare should start at home, and is working to evolve Inito from a fertility tracker into a broader hormone and at-home health diagnostics platform. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074291\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg 8192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024_10_03_Inito_2461-Edit-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Inito</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inito is using the new funding to invest in and develop AI-engineered antibodies, which it says will allow for the development of new types of tests and improve the accuracy of existing ones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For context, when you take a test at a lab or a home, antibodies are what bind to the target molecule (such as estrogen or testosterone) to produce a signal. Traditional antibodies are grown inside animals and then screened manually in the lab, which can be a slow and expensive process. Conventional antibodies also lack the sensitivity to make at-home tests for a large number of biomarkers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inito says AI-designed antibodies change the game. Instead of “raising” antibodies in animals, they can be treated almost like software. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We predict how proteins fold in 3D, design synthetic antibodies using AI, and test millions of variants virtually before making a single one in the lab,” explained Inito co-founder and CTO Varun A Venkatesan in an email. “This produces antibodies that are far more sensitive, consistent, and stable than anything developed through traditional methods.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Inito, this will unlock the next generation of at-home tests. Venkatesan says the company is already using these methods in R&amp;D and that its wet-lab is showing promising results. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074296\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=1200,802 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=1280,855 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=900,601 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=561,375 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=924,617 924w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC00143-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Inito</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The real vision is bigger than adding new tests,” said Inito co-founder and CEO Aayush Rai. “The endgame is to redefine diagnostics altogether. If you want to understand what’s happening inside your body at every life stage and health need, you shouldn’t be limited by clinic appointments, lab schedules, or rigid testing systems. You should be able to measure, track, and get insights about your body from home, with lab-grade confidence.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inito wants to expand its vision beyond a “trying to conceive” platform. Its reader and app will soon power tests for pregnancy, menopause, and broader at-home health monitoring. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our long-term roadmap goes far beyond fertility,” said Rai. “We’re building toward a platform that can measure and interpret the full spectrum of hormones that shape health across a lifetime. Pregnancy progression, menopause, and broader endocrine markers like testosterone — all powered by AI antibodies and imaging that sets Inito apart today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is going to use part of the funding to scale manufacturing and grow globally to meet growing demand across the United States and new international markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inito’s latest funding round was led by Bertelsmann India Investments and Fireside Ventures. The investment brings Inito’s total funding to around $45 million. The company previously raised $6 million in funding led by Fireside Ventures and $9 million from Y Combinator, former Nurx CEO Varsha Rao, and a dozen physicians and family offices.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/tariff-turmoil-may-have-killed-the-tech-ma-markets-comeback/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">President Trump’s tariffs went into effect</a> — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90.

In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/openais-investment-into-thrive-holdings-is-its-latest-circular-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“Circular” business deals</a>, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-24b-ai-deal-blitz-has-wall-street-asking-questions-about-murky-circular-investments-110039309.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised questions</a> about the industry’s long-term economic stability.

After it acquired <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/coreweave-acquires-ai-developer-platform-weights-biases/\">Weights &amp; Biases</a>, an AI developer platform, in March, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/03/coreweave-acquires-agent-training-startup-openpipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it went on to acquire OpenPipe</a>, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning.

McLeod and a dedicated team spent the year developing the idea of Overtone, which is described as “an early-stage dating service focused on using AI and voice tools to help people connect in a more thoughtful and personal way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McLeod isn’t the only dating app founder branching out into new, standalone AI experiences. Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder of Bumble, said <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/whitney-wolfe-herd-bumble-ai-398779bb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqc3E-3I0kZ72C6FwfqTXZQvZyOcbRCcFG-2BdgEj6XABPWVHeHW9YBA5_DT694%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6938aec1&amp;gaa_sig=yl0lflEClnun-lBXM5aEoEyont1rb5SqaGGQbzeYfqU5nMOWX1dcDJ0fKM4jB6OcYlBozDfavdnL_zzDiOh6JA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">she wants to use AI</a> to make “the world’s smartest and most emotionally intelligent matchmaker in existence.” Somewhat infamously, Wolfe Herd <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/ai-personas-are-future-dating-bumble-founder-says-many-arent-buying-rcna151738\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">proposed</a> the idea last year of singles using AI to stand-in for themselves and date other people’s AIs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not yet clear how Overtone will differentiate itself from other dating apps, which have been experimenting with AI features to compensate for the market’s growing malaise with online dating — especially among <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91443225/gen-z-is-ghosting-dating-apps-could-ai-win-them-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gen Z</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder has reported nine straight quarters of paying-subscriber declines and has leaned into AI with features that are supposed to help users get more matches. Hinge launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/hinges-new-ai-feature-helps-daters-start-better-convos-moving-beyond-boring-small-talk/\">another AI feature</a> just this week called “Convo Starters,” which is supposed to help daters come up with more interesting things to say than the usual small talk. Tinder and Facebook Dating have each experimented with AI-powered matching to combat “swipe fatigue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ceding control of your dating experience is one thing, but other attempts at integrating AI into these apps get even more dubious. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Match CEO Spencer Rascoff said last month that a “major pillar of Tinder’s upcoming 2026 product experience” will be a feature called Chemistry. With the user’s permission, the feature will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/tinder-to-use-ai-to-get-to-know-users-tap-into-their-camera-roll-photos/\">access users’ camera rolls</a> to learn more about them. (For the record, we would advise that you do not give tech companies unfettered access to even more of your data.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McLeod founded Hinge in 2011 as a dating app with a greater focus on building relationships than facilitating casual dates. The app, which is on track to hit $1 billion in revenue by 2027, was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/match-fully-acquires-relationship-focused-app-hinge/\">acquired</a> by Match in 2019. Jackie Jantos, Hinge’s president and chief marketing officer, will take over as CEO. McLeod will remain in an advisory position at Hinge through March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This summer, TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/hinge-cmo-jackie-jantos-hopes-to-help-make-gen-zers-less-lonely/\">spoke to Jantos</a> at SXSW London about how Hinge will address Gen Z, a market that’s growing <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/06/dating-apps-doomed-former-hinge-leader-says-gen-z-meet-in-person/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">increasingly disillusioned</a> with meeting people online.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a generation that has grown up with a deep understanding of how digital experiences are created and what they are trying to get out of them,” Jantos told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gen Z wants transparency and authenticity from digital brands, according to Jantos. While some might see this as inherently incompatible with the company’s growing reliance on AI, Hinge’s AI recommendation feature, launched in March, drove a <a href=\"https://ir.mtch.com/investor-relations/news-events/news-events/news-details/2025/Match-Group-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">15% increase</a> in matches and contact exchanges in the first quarter of this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on Jantos’ comments upon assuming her new role, it seems that Hinge will continue investing in these features under her leadership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our focus will remain on intentional innovation that is grounded in culture, creativity, and a deep understanding of how people connect today,” Jantos said in a statement.<br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But that market insight isn’t cheap, nor is it quick. <a href=\"https://www.cashewresearch.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cashew Research</a> wants to change that using AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calgary, Alberta-based Cashew uses AI to develop market research plans and surveys for brands based on what information they are looking for — like what their brand recognition is for a specific population or how a marketing tagline resonates with customers. Cashew then sends the survey to real people and uses AI to summarize and digest the findings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cashew was one of the 200 startups chosen for TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition in 2025 and won the Enterprise Stage pitch competition at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2025&amp;utm_content=ticketsales&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=tc\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can use an LLM to try to do deep research and get answers to your questions, or you could use a firm that’s going to be really expensive,” Addy Graves, co-founder and CEO of Cashew, told TechCrunch in describing the current market research industry. “Now there’s Cashew that exists in the middle. It creates custom, fresh data to answer your question instead of you just using an LLM that’s surfacing the same recycled pool of data that everybody’s finding on the internet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves has more than a decade of market research experience. The original idea for Cashew was sparked by an issue she ran into frequently: Clients wanted full research projects — with real-world data from humans — done within a few days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, shortening that timeline while still producing the same quality of research results wasn’t possible, Graves said, because the technology to speed up the process wasn’t ready yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That was definitely the aha moment,” Graves said. “And it wasn’t until the onset of AI that we were actually able to automate these processes that we use as researchers, best practices, these data science-backed methodologies, as well as the formatting of reports that we know that everybody wants.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bringing automation to the process also brings the cost down, which makes Cashew an option for small and medium-size brands that wouldn’t have been able to afford to work with a traditional market research firm, Graves added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves founded Cashew in 2023 alongside Rose Wong, chief operating officer, with an initial focus on consumer packaged goods, specifically food and beverage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves said she thinks Cashew can stand out in the increasingly crowded AI marketing tools category because it isn’t fully automated. Each Cashew client gets fresh human data with each project, which requires market research expertise, Graves said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cashew’s competitive advantage may only grow as the company matures. The company takes all of the real-world data it collects from its clients’ projects, anonymizes it, and puts it in a database, which can help add additional proprietary data to future research projects, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised C$1.5 million in pre-seed funding and is gearing up to launch its seed round in early 2026 with the hope of raising up to $5 million, Graves said. That capital will be put toward continuing to develop the product’s tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Graves said the company’s two main areas of focus heading into next year are increasing the company’s presence in the U.S. and also working to build up its B2B business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The people who are already buying research, that’s already a massive category, but that doesn’t even include all the people that could be buying research but just can’t afford it or can’t do it right now because they don’t have the timelines,” Graves said. “We’re actually creating this new category for marketers to gain access to answers to these questions that they’ve had.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
