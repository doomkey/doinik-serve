A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-marketing-for-autopilot-and-full-self-driving-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deceptive marketing</a> by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California DMV, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now only come standard with Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision comes one week after the company said that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/tesla-will-only-offer-subscriptions-for-full-self-driving-supervised-going-forward/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">starting on February 14</a>, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2014539856890716418?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in a post</a> on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/musk-says-new-tesla-software-allows-texting-and-driving-which-is-illegal-in-most-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">texting while driving is illegal in almost all states</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, Tesla rolled out the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-in-austin-with-no-human-safety-driver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first robotaxi versions</a> of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas that have no human safety monitoring personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software, and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-full-self-driving-sales-customers-pay-fsd-2025-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kais Khimji has spent most of his professional career as a venture investor, including six years as a partner at the prominent VC firm Sequoia Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But just like several other former Sequoia partners — including David Vélez, who founded the Brazilian digital bank Nubank — Khimji (pictured left) has always wanted to be a startup founder. On Thursday, he announced that he has revived an idea he began working on as a student at Harvard about 10 years ago, turning it into the AI calendar-scheduling company Blockit. In a major vote of confidence, Khimji’s former employer, Sequoia, led the company’s $5 million seed round.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Blockit has a chance to become a $1Bn+ revenue business, and Kais will make sure it gets there,” Pat Grady, Sequoia’s general partner and co-steward who led the investment, wrote in a <a href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/the-most-precious-resource/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many startups have tried to automate scheduling in the past, Khimji believes that thanks to advances in LLMs, Blockit’s AI agents can handle scheduling more seamlessly and efficiently than many of its predecessors, including now-defunct startups Clara Labs and x.ai. (Yes, that domain name ended up with Elon Musk’s AI company.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the current category leader Calendly, which was last valued at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$3 billion</a> and relies on users sharing links to find availability, Blockit is betting that its AI agents can master the nuance required to handle the entire scheduling process without human involvement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Blockit, Khimji and co-founder John Hahn — who previously worked on calendar products, including Timeful, Google Calendar, and Clockwise — are building what is essentially an AI social network for people’s time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It always felt very odd. I have a time database — my calendar. You have a time database — your calendar, and our databases just can’t talk to each other,” Khimji told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khimji says that Blockit can finally solve this disconnection. When two users need to meet, their respective AI agents communicate directly to negotiate a time, bypassing the typical back-and-forth emails entirely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can invoke the Blockit agent by copying it on an email or messaging it in Slack about a meeting. The bot then takes over the logistics, negotiating a mutually convenient time and location that fits the preferences of all participants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khimji said that Blockit can work as seamlessly as a human executive assistant. Users simply need to provide the system with specific instructions about their preferences, such as which meetings are nonnegotiable and which are “movable” based on daily needs. “Sometimes my calendar is crazy, so I need to skip lunch, and the agent needs to know that it’s okay to skip lunch,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system can even be trained to prioritize meetings based on the tone of an email. For instance, a user might instruct the agent that a meeting request signed with a formal “Best regards” should take precedence over a casual interaction ending with “Cheers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By learning the preferences of its users, Blockit appears to be capitalizing on what venture firm Foundation Capital’s partners Jaya Gupta and Ashu Garg call “context graphs.” In a <a href=\"https://foundationcapital.com/context-graphs-ais-trillion-dollar-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">widely shared essay</a>, the investors describe a multibillion-dollar opportunity for AI agents to capture the “why” behind every business decision by relying on the hidden logic that previously only existed in a person’s head.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blockit is already being used by more than 200 companies, including AI startup Together.ai, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/capital-one-acquires-brex-for-steep-discount-to-its-peak-valuation-but-early-believers-are-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">newly acquired</a> fintech company Brex, and robotics startup Rogo, as well as venture firms a16z, Accel, and Index. The app is available for free for 30 days. After that, it costs $1,000 annually for individual users and $5,000 annually for a team license with support for multiple users, Khimji said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Luckey told TechCrunch that these will be new jobs, not transfers from other operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anduril’s headquarters is nearby, in Costa Mesa, California, and it also has a massive <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/anduril-to-build-its-billion-dollar-weapons-megafactory-in-ohio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">manufacturing facility in Ohio</a>. The Long Beach campus will span 1.18 million square feet across six buildings, combining office space and industrial areas dedicated to R&amp;D. It is expected to be ready by mid-2027, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long Beach is “a major aerospace hub right in our backyard,” Luckey told TechCrunch about why the company chose that location.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan is to hire similar types of employees to those working at headquarters: manufacturing workers, technicians, assembly workers, and engineers across disciplines (electrical, mechanical, aerodynamics), as well as build and test roles, and “a lot of people on the logistics side, because the things that we’re going to be making there, we’re going to be sending all over the world,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While bringing thousands of jobs to his childhood town made headlines today, Luckey said the most exciting part for him about Anduril’s general expansion was the fighter jets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It looks like we’re going to be able to manufacture autonomous fighter jets that will take off right from the factory and fly to wherever the customer needs them,” he said. “We might have jets leaving the factory, flying directly into combat.

That change will also mean the end of its rebooted Chevrolet Bolt EV, the only vehicle currently built at the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The factory musical chairs reflect an economic and political environment, shaped by the Trump administration’s tariff policy and its decision to end the federal EV tax credit, which provided up to $7,500 off qualifying electric vehicles. These changes have made it more expensive to build vehicles in China and Mexico that are then sold in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Production of the 2027 Chevy Bolt EV, which landed in dealerships this month, is expected to end in about a year and a half. The new Chevy Bolt EV, which is priced at $29,990 including the destination fee, is one of the most affordable new EVs available to U.S. consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM confirmed to TechCrunch that the next-generation Buick Envision, currently built in China, will move to the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas, beginning in 2028. The gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox, which is made in the San Luis Potosí plant in Mexico, will move to the Kansas factory in mid-2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bolt, meanwhile, will have a short life if GM follows through with its previously announced plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we revealed Bolt in October, we said and it was widely reported that it’d be a limited run model,” a GM spokesperson said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. “We had also previously announced the gas-powered Equinox would be coming to Fairfax in mid 2027 after Bolt production ramps down. Today we’re announcing the next-generation Buick compact SUV will come to Fairfax beginning in 2028.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company still sells other EVs, including an electric Chevy Equinox and Chevy Blazer. The question is whether GM will change course and save the Bolt if sales are better than expected. We do know that GM has promised to make new future investments in Fairfax Assembly for its next generation of affordable EVs. We just don’t know when. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

So when the WSJ broke the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/capital-one-to-buy-fintech-brex-e2dacc67?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdQYIOeIOszihr5TIanBgUeAqhUqm02UJhblSzrDp3zz9xSBv6_B58mcCf-__4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6972a926&amp;gaa_sig=motWZgARAOIvF8rFrITt0ecaNp4ZtN3L8XrY_2eEBgLSTE2bXeCXLkOgLE1Q6VnRskW6KO8PNoHiczKohkB3Sw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">news</a> Thursday afternoon that Capital One will acquire Brex for $5.15 billion in cash and stock (Capital One issued an <a href=\"https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-acquire-brex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">official release</a> confirming the details 30 minutes later), you could practically hear the collective snickering from Sand Hill Road to San Francisco’s South Park. That figure represents less than half of Brex’s last private-market valuation of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/\">$12.3 billion from its 2022 Series D-2</a> round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before everyone sharpens their knives, consider that for the VCs who backed Brex at its outset, the sale is a triumph. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Micky Malka’s Ribbit Capital, which led Brex’s $7 million Series A soon after its 2017 founding, is likely staring at a very handsome return. Reached by phone this afternoon, Malka declined to offer specifics, but as a Brex board member from the outset and the company’s biggest shareholder, he was unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the deal: “We’re excited for the team, which was one of the youngest YC teams at the time. I’ve known [the founders] since they were 16. Capital One will be a great partner, and their ability to scale [as part of the bank] is good for America.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, that early bet — Ribbit was joined by Y Combinator, Kleiner Perkins, DST Global, and individual investors including Peter Thiel and Max Levchin — has multiplied somewhere in the neighborhood of 700-fold. Even accounting for dilution across subsequent rounds, early stakeholders are walking away with the kind of gains that have long made venture capital seem like such an attractive asset class to outsiders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the sting of that valuation haircut is sharper when you consider what happened to Brex’s chief rival, Ramp, during the same period. Just as Brex lost momentum several years ago, Ramp went on a tear. The competing expense management fintech has at this point raised $2.3 billion in total equity financing and saw its valuation zoom from $13 billion in March of last year to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/ramp-hits-32b-valuation-just-three-months-after-hitting-22-5b/\">$32 billion by November</a> across <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ramp-raises-500-million-at-22-5-billion-valuation-to-accelerate-ai-and-build-the-future-of-finance-302516953.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">successive</a> funding <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/in-just-3-months-ramps-valuation-jumped-to-16b-up-from-13b/\">rounds</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You could argue whether those kinds of paper gains across a dizzying number of financing events means that much (that’s definitely not always the case). Still, assuming Ramp is presenting a truthful picture to the world, it’s traction in undeniable. The company announced last October that it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized recurring revenue and secured more than 50,000 customers. The contrast is probably more painful for Brex’s later-stage investors, who watched a competitor lap them multiple times while they awaited an exit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Capital One deal comes at a bit of an inflection point for Brex. Just five months ago, the company announced it had secured a license to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/ipo-hopeful-brex-scored-major-win-to-sell-in-the-eu-plans-uk-expansion/\">operate in the European Union</a>. As CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote in a blog post at the time, the move enabled Brex to “directly issue credit and debit cards and offer its spend management products to any business in all 30 EU countries with no workarounds required.” Previously, the company could only work with EU firms that maintained a U.S. presence, a significant limitation for a would-be global player.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Capital One, the timing is as good as it gets. The bank, which already swallowed Discover Financial in a <a href=\"https://investor.capitalone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/capital-one-completes-acquisition-discover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$35 billion deal</a> last May, gains Brex’s tech platform and client roster — including, reportedly, TikTok, Robinhood, and Intel — as well as immediate access to European corporate banking customers through its freshly minted EU license. (TechCrunch has reached out to Brex for more information.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $13 billion in deposits that Brex reportedly oversees at partner banks and money-market funds also presumably sweetened the pot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders, Brazilian entrepreneurs Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras, dropped out of Stanford as freshmen to launched Brex in 2017 after being accepted into YC’s winter 2017 “batch,” initially pitching a virtual reality concept. But they were bound to circle back to payments having sold — at the tender age of 16 — a payments processor startup in Brazil that had raised $30 million and was later acquired for more than $1 billion by one of its strategic investors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dubugras stepped back from day-to-day operations in 2024 to serve as board chairman; Franceschi will remain CEO post-acquisition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with nearly every startup, Brex’s path wasn’t without its stumbles. There was a <a href=\"https://sfist.com/2019/09/11/south-park-cafe-gets-new-life-with-backing-from/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">questionable detour</a> in 2019, when the then-23-year-old co-CEOs, who had never run a restaurant, bought San Francisco’s beloved South Park Cafe. The pair had envisioned Brex cardmembers dining before heading upstairs to an exclusive lounge, a timing decision that proved spectacularly lousy, when COVID-19 shut down most of San Francisco for over a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, in 2022, as the macroeconomic picture darkened and VCs began demanding actual profitability from their portfolio companies, Brex made a decision that generated <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/19/what-was-really-behind-brexs-decision-to-ditch-smbs/\">considerable ill will</a>; it abandoned tens of thousands of small- and medium-size business customers, informing them their accounts would close unless they had “professional” funding from VCs, angels, or accelerators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move, designed to focus resources on higher-margin enterprise clients and a nascent SaaS business, struck many as tone-deaf. The company that had built its reputation serving underbanked startups and was suddenly showing its champions the door (was how the move was perceived at the time).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The strategy may be what positioned Brex for this exit. By concentrating on corporate clients with deeper pockets and predictable revenue streams, the company stabilized its business model, even as Ramp ramped up its fundraising. (Mercury, another competitor, also doubled its valuation to $3.5 billion with a $300 million raise last March. To steal some of the attention paid in 2025 to Ramp, Mercury more recently shared with Fortune that it had hit a rate of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-mercury-valued-3-5-124714168.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$650 million</a> in annual recurring revenue.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Capital One said it expects to close the deal in the second quarter. For Brex’s later-stage investors, including TCV, GIC, Baillie Gifford, Madrone Capital Partners, Durable Capital Partners, Valiant Capital Management, and Base10, all of which invested at a <a href=\"https://www.brex.com/journal/press/series-d-investment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$7.4 billion valuation</a> or higher, the exit may not be quite what they hoped, but they’re still liquid, which, in today’s climate, counts for something.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Pictured above: Brex co-founder and CEO Pedro Franceschi</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Models have mastered in-depth research and agentic planning, but for whatever reason, most white-collar work has been relatively unaffected. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s one of the biggest mysteries in AI — and thanks to new research from the training-data giant Mercor, we’re finally getting some answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new research looks at how leading AI models hold up doing actual white-collar work tasks, drawn from consulting, investment banking, and law. The result is a new benchmark called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14242\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">APEX-Agents</a> — and so far, every AI lab is getting a failing grade. Faced with queries from real professionals, even the best models struggled to get more than a quarter of the questions right. The vast majority of the time, the model came back with a wrong answer or no answer at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Mercor CEO Brendan Foody, who worked on the paper, the models’ biggest stumbling point was tracking down information across multiple domains — something that’s integral to most of the knowledge work performed by humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the big changes in this benchmark is that we built out the entire environment, modeled after real professional services,” Foody told TechCrunch. “The way we do our jobs isn’t with one individual giving us all the context in one place. In real life, you’re operating across Slack and Google Drive and all these other tools.” For many agentic AI models, that kind of multi-domain reasoning is still hit or miss.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085292\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg 1362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,346 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,307 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=1200,541 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=1280,577 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=430,194 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=720,325 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=900,406 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=800,361 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=668,301 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=708,319 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scenarios were all drawn from actual professionals on Mercor’s expert marketplace, who both laid out the queries and set the standard for a successful response. Looking through the questions, which are <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/mercor/apex-agents/blob/main/tasks_and_rubrics.json\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted publicly on Hugging Face</a>, gives a sense of how complex the tasks can get. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One question in the “Law” section reads: </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the first 48 minutes of the EU production outage, Northstar’s engineering team exported one or two bundled sets of EU production event logs containing personal data to the U.S. analytics vendor … Under Northstar’s own policies, it can reasonably treat the one or two log exports as consistent with Article 49?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The correct answer is yes, but getting there requires an in-depth assessment of the company’s own policies as well as the relevant EU privacy laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That might stump even a well-informed human, but the researchers were trying to model the work done by professionals in the field. If an LLM can reliably answer these questions, it could effectively replace many of the lawyers working today. “I think this is probably the most important topic in the economy,” Foody told TechCrunch. “The benchmark is very reflective of the real work that these people do.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI also attempted to measure professional skills with <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gdpval/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its GDPval benchmark</a> — but the APEX-Agents test differs in important ways. Where GDPval tests general knowledge across a wide range of professions, the APEX-Agents benchmark measures the system’s ability to perform sustained tasks in a narrow set of high-value professions. The result is more difficult for models, but also more closely tied to whether these jobs can be automated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While none of the models proved ready to take over as investment bankers, some were clearly closer to the mark. Gemini 3 Flash performed the best of the group with 24% one-shot accuracy, followed closely by GPT-5.2 with 23%. Below that, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5 all scored roughly 18%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the initial results fall short, the AI field has a history of blowing through challenging benchmarks. Now that the APEX-Agents test is public, it’s an open challenge for AI labs that believe they can do better — something Foody fully expects in the months to come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s improving really quickly,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now it’s fair to say it’s like an intern that gets it right a quarter of the time, but last year it was the intern that gets it right five or 10% of the time. That kind of improvement year after year can have an impact so quickly.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Thursday, the Amazon-owned device maker <a href=\"https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/your-ring-videos-verified/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced</a> Ring Verify, a new video authenticity feature that will allow anyone to determine whether a video has been altered in any way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says this could be useful when you come across shared videos, like those sent to you by a neighbor or those purporting to show some sort of incident.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While you may not be able to instantly identify whether some TikTok video was AI-generated — like <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ai-bunnies-on-trampoline-causing-crisis-of-confidence-on-tiktok/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bunnies jumping on a trampoline</a>, for instance — you will be alerted to any changes to a Ring video that someone has shared with you directly.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085236\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg 1074w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=768,581 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=680,514 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=430,325 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=720,544 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=900,680 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=800,605 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=668,505 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=496,375 496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=816,617 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=702,531 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.35-PM.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ring</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think of it like the tamper-evident seal on a medicine bottle — if anyone changes the video in any way, even something small like trimming a few seconds or adjusting the brightness, the seal breaks,” Ring explained in its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/your-ring-videos-verified/\">announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The verification feature will be automatically enabled on every video recorded with a Ring device from December 2025 onward, the company notes. Any changes or edits, including cropping and filters, will break that verification seal. Ring says this includes videos uploaded to sharing sites that compress footage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Failing verification doesn’t necessarily mean the video is fake. It’s just a signal that it has been altered. Maybe someone boosted the brightness for visibility, or it could mean the video was recorded before December 2025.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085235\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg 1276w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=680,423 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=1200,747 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=430,268 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=720,448 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=900,560 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=800,498 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=668,416 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=603,375 603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=992,617 992w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=708,441 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-22-at-2.25.41-PM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ring</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of a failed verification, recipients can request a copy of the unedited video. Ring suggests this could be useful for purposes like insurance claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The verification feature, which is built on C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) industry standards, will be present on all videos downloaded or shared from Ring’s cloud, regardless of the specific device that captured the footage. But the company notes that content verification will not be compatible with videos recorded using end-to-end encryption — those will always show as “not verified,” it said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To verify footage, Ring will be able to visit the website <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ring.com/verify\">Ring.com/verify</a> and submit their video link and get instant results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of publication, TechCrunch noticed the verification website was not yet up and running. The coma y says the correct URL is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ring.com/pages/verify\">http://www.ring.com/pages/verify</a> and its blog had it listed incorrectly. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s announcement was also delayed due to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/microsoft-365-hit-by-outage-preventing-access-to-emails-and-files/\">outage with Microsoft 365 today</a>, a rep for Ring said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz4eMgBS0dI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an interview with Axios at Davos</a>, the AI leader was responding to a question about using ads to monetize AI services, saying the idea is something that the team at Google was thinking through “very carefully.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hassabis also said that his team wasn’t feeling pressure from the tech giant to make “a knee-jerk” decision around advertising, despite how key ads are to Google’s core business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DeepMind co-founder’s remarks followed Friday’s news that OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/\">will begin </a><span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/\" target=\"_blank\">testing ads</a> as a way to generate</span> additional revenue from the portion of the AI chatbot’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/\">800 million weekly active users</a> who don’t have a paid subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI may have been forced to consider ads, considering its growing <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/19/openai-reveals-data-center-capacity-tripled-1-9gw-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">infrastructure</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-fed-lisa-cook-trump-nvidia-01-21-2026/card/openai-to-cover-data-center-power-costs-amid-mounting-pressure-qwIQkH5ueShBs4fqq7Xl?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcQTJQn_DwM62viX4DaUkRgHbmbymDJSxi1CdwpmH5pGYDp3zlixb1yiVIKphY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69726d89&amp;gaa_sig=oxmmjSElZo7ln0MP4vXqhHKw52PJNcDaEfVqzYIkUXgR8BDxikFN9DpYIMEx7i6an0Zv9inGOyZqDc3CbDRz0Q%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and energy costs</a>, its decision could change how users view the service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m a little bit surprised they’ve moved so early into that,” Hassabis said, referring to OpenAI’s adoption of ads. “I mean, look, ads, there’s nothing wrong with ads…they funded much of the consumer internet. And if done well, they can be useful,” he clarified.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But in the realm of assistants, and if you think of the chatbot as an assistant that’s meant to be helpful — and ideally, in my mind, as they become more powerful, the kind of technology that works for you as the individual…there is a question about how ads fit into that model?… You want to have trust in your assistant, so how does that work?” he questioned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reiterating <a href=\"https://sources.news/p/googles-ai-boss-no-plans-for-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some early comments</a> from another Davos interview, Hassabis also said that Google didn’t have “any current plans” to do ads in its AI chatbot. Instead, the company would monitor the situation to see how users respond.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, we’ve already seen consumer backlash to the idea of ads infiltrating people’s conversations with AI assistants. When OpenAI last month began exploring a feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/openai-slammed-for-app-suggestions-that-looked-like-ads/\">that suggested apps to try</a> during users’ chats, for instance, people reacted negatively, saying these suggestions felt like intrusive ads. Shortly after, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/07/openai-says-its-turned-off-app-suggestions-that-look-like-ads/\">OpenAI turned off the app suggestions</a>, which it claimed were not actually ads as they had “no financial component.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But whether or not money had exchanged hands was not what made users angry. Rather, it was how the app suggestions degraded the quality of the experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s something that also concerns Hassabis, his remarks suggested. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He explained that using a chatbot is a much different experience than using Google Search. With Search, Google already understands a user’s intent, so it can show potentially useful ads. Chatbots, on the other hand, are meant to become helpful digital assistants that know about you and can help you with many aspects of your life, he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that’s very different from the search use case. So I think there, that has to be thought through very carefully,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making Gemini more useful to each user is also the focus of<span> </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/googles-ai-mode-can-now-tap-into-your-gmail-and-photos-to-provide-tailored-responses/\">newly launched personalization features announced today</a> for Google’s AI Mode. Now, users can opt into having Gemini’s AI tap into their Gmail and Photos for tailored responses in Search’s AI Mode, similar to how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/geminis-new-beta-feature-provides-proactive-responses-based-on-your-photos-emails-and-more/\">Gemini’s app just added a Personal Intelligence feature</a> that can reference users’ Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While personalized ad targeting is a business that sustains the free web, pushing an ad on the user while they’re in a conversation with an AI assistant can feel off-putting. It’s why customers rejected Amazon’s earlier attempts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/14/alexa-answers-customer-questions-with-ads/\">infuse ads into its Alexa experience</a> — they wanted an assistant, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/surprise-no-one-buys-things-via-alexa/\">not a personal shopper</a> hawking things for them to buy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hassabis said he wasn’t feeling top-down pressure to force ads into the AI product, either, though he admitted there may be a way to do them right later on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t feel any immediate pressure to make knee-jerk decisions like that — I think that’s been the history of what we’ve done at DeepMind — is be very scientific, and rigorous, and thoughtful about each step that we take — be that the technology itself or the product,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI chatbots are getting better at answering questions, summarizing documents, and solving mathematical equations, but they still largely behave like helpful assistants for one user at a time. They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp;, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/humans-a-human-centric-ai-startup-founded-by-anthropic-xai-google-alums-raised-480m-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a $480 million seed round</a> to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI for empowering humans</a>” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of Humans&amp;’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp;’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans&amp; still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/slackbot-is-an-ai-agent-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slack</a>) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of Humans&amp; and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that Humans&amp; doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said Humans&amp; is designing the product in conjunction with the model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What is clear, though, is that Humans&amp; isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$43 million round</a> at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman <a href=\"https://x.com/reidhoffman/status/2014028797507449206?s=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote on social media</a>. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the space where Humans&amp; wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a Humans&amp; co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent academic work</a> as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans&amp; will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The top risk, though, is that Humans&amp; isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives Humans&amp; a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&amp;A is certainly a risk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp; told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company <a href=\"https://on.substack.com/p/introducing-the-substack-tv-app-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Thursday that the beta app will allow subscribers to watch video posts and livestreams on TV created by authors on its platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The TV app features a TikTok-like “For You” row that will highlight videos from these creators, along with recommended videos.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Free and paid subscribers can now start using the TV app, with access based on their subscription tier. Substack plans to add paid content previews for free subscribers in the future. The platform also plans to add audio posts and read-alouds, enhanced search and discovery features, in-app upgrades to paid subscriptions, and dedicated sections for each publication where subscribers can explore all videos from a specific creator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as Substack has been investing more heavily in video and livestreaming, as it looks to compete with platforms like YouTube and Patreon for both creators and viewers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Substack began its push into video with the launch of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/substack-is-testing-a-video-feature-which-will-roll-out-widely-in-the-coming-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">video posts</a> back in 2022. It then started allowing creators <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/substack-now-lets-creators-monetize-videos-and-post-them-directly-from-its-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to monetize videos</a> early last year. Around the same time, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/substack-rolls-out-livestreaming-for-all-publishers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rolled out livestreaming capabilities</a> to all publishers. The company has also embraced short-form video, launching a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/substack-is-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-in-its-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok-like video feed</a> in its app in March 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Substack is the home for the best longform—work creators put real care into and subscribers choose to spend time with,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://on.substack.com/p/introducing-the-substack-tv-app-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “Now these thought-provoking videos and livestreams have a natural home on the TV, where subscribers can settle in for the extended viewing that great video deserves.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Substack sees the launch as the next step in its video ambitions, comments on its announcement tell another story. The top comment on the company’s blog post reads: “Please don’t do this. This is not YouTube. Elevate the written word.” Another popular comment reads: “You guys have gone from saying Substack is the best home for longform writing/writers to ‘Substack is the home for the best longform—work…’. I get trying to evolve, but this just seems like another venture capital-fueled idea.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other comments reflect a similar sentiment, questioning why the platform appears to be shifting its focus from writing to video. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Substack isn’t the only platform pushing into the living room, as Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/instagram-brings-reels-to-the-big-screen-starting-with-amazon-fire-tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recently launched IG for TV</a>, a new experience that lets users watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.<br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By making SAT prep free, Google is trying to open the door for more students to compete on equal footing.

Many teachers worry that students might end up leaning too heavily on tools like Gemini and ChatGPT to get their work done. If students let AI do all the thinking, it could chip away at their problem-solving skills. There are even <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">studies</a> out there that <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">back this up</a>, suggesting that relying too much on AI can actually weaken students’ ability to think critically and tackle challenges on their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s also not forget about human SAT tutors.

Second, Liu also realized that many of these founders, especially women and minorities, were struggling to fund their ideas due to limited access to founder networks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To bridge this gap, she launched <a href=\"https://www.crushitventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Crush It Ventures</a>, a wellness-focused early-stage fund. The firm hopes to back companies building across the wellness sector, including in mental health, fitness and sport, beauty, and hospitality. On Thursday, it announced the final close of a $5 million Fund I. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The wellness industry often overlaps with the health sector (like sleep and body health), making it quite hard to estimate how big it truly is. Nonetheless, wellness trends have been booming in the past few years. Gyms have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/27/gen-z-exercise-healthy-pub-gym-benefits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">become a Gen Z obsession</a>, and so have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/27/running-gen-z-boom-athletics-london-marathon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">run clubs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A McKinsey <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/future-of-wellness-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">study from last year found </a>that the U.S. alone spends more than $500 billion a year on wellness. Young people in particular have become big spenders as they continue to openly talk about mental health and burnout. The McKinsey report said that though Gen Z makes up 36% of the adult U.S. population, they are responsible for over 41% of wellness spending. This is compared to those 58 and older, who make up around 35% of the U.S. population, yet account for 28% of wellness spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu believes this area has become so popular because people are realizing that health is more than just physical fitness — it also involves mental, emotional, and social well-being. “As we automate more with technology in our daily lives, we’re valuing experiences and products that foster real connection and long-term well-being,” she said. “It’s also a reflection of shifting values: younger generations want purpose-driven brands and are craving real community.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu said she started raising the fund in 2024. Though the environment was “cautious,” she said, there was a growing interest in wellness, “especially from LPs looking for more diverse mission-driven funds.” The environment for new funds <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-venture-capital-firm-concentration-first-half-2025-founders-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is still tough </a>(especially <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2025/10/17/women-led-vc-funds-rise-equity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">for a woman solo GP</a>) as most of the capital continues to flow to the top firms.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu declined to share the name of the LPs in the fund but said she was able to break through as a new fund manager by leaning into her network. She has a background in banking before angel investing in the gym, later joining as CFO. During her decade there, she was CEO for two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Dogpound, she worked with founders and celebrities around the world. “I learned that brand building is not just about marketing a product or service, but about creating a space for shared experiences, joy, and genuine connection,” she said, adding that her fund is keen on helping founders build their brand and communities as they scale their businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crush It plans to typically write checks of $100,000 to $250,000, and invest in between 20 and 25 companies, she said. So far, the firm has invested in 18 companies, like the wearable tech company <a href=\"https://elemindtech.com/products/elemind?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=23139288858&amp;utm_content=784712397806&amp;utm_term=elemind&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23139288858&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9S6XYNdXN6WYfKknWVw43BgHBynB&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAj8LLBhAkEiwAJjbY7wiX6SiwUp-QRndjMZ7mA6c9DzCG6e6V2jQWPg2vjdP7mLpNGXT92xoCWaEQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elemind</a> and CPG business <a href=\"https://drinkcaliwater.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Caliwater</a>.
