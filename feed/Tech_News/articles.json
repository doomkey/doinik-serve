Officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which houses CISA, sought to determine if there was any harm to government security as a result of his uploads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uploading unclassified but internal government documents to a public version of a large language model is problematic, as it allows the model to train itself on that information, potentially allowing its contents to be shared with others who use it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A CISA spokesperson told Politico that Gottumukkala’s use of ChatGPT was “short-term and limited.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to his appointment at CISA, Gottumukkala served as the chief information officer of South Dakota under then-governor Kristi Noem.

Nvidia is the classic example: As AI companies build out data centers, they’re buying up billions of dollars of GPUs each month, turning Nvidia into the most valuable company on earth. But Nvidia has suppliers too, and looking at them can give us an even longer-term view of the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why we care about <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.asml.com/en\">ASML</a>, a Dutch photolithography company that has become a key linchpin for the semiconductor industry. ASML is the sole supplier of the EUV equipment needed to make cutting-edge chips, making it a central supplier for the entire industry. When ASML does well, it’s because companies are expecting to sell a lot of semiconductors. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And based on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/q4-2025-financial-results\">the quarterly earnings released Wednesday morning</a>, the company is doing very well indeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The topline figure is 32.7 billion euros in net sales, which is a lot of money by any standards. But for our purposes, the most important figure is “new bookings,” which represent the new orders that came in this quarter. Looking at those orders tells us how much capacity chip manufacturers think they’ll need, based on the orders they expect from data center buildouts in the years to come.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By that metric, the AI infrastructure boom is still going strong. Last quarter, ASML brought in 13 billion euros worth of new orders, a new record for the company and more than double the orders that came in the quarter before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an earnings statement, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet made it clear the extra demand was coming from AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the last months, many of our customers have shared a notably more positive assessment of the medium-term market situation, primarily based on more robust expectations of the sustainability of AI-related demand,” Fouquet wrote. In non-CEO English, that means their customers expect AI labs will really need all the data centers they’re building, and they’re spending money now so they can be ready to supply the chips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear: none of this is guaranteed to happen. The future is unwritten! It may be years before all those orders are filled, and some clients may pull out before delivery time. The dreaded Zitron predictions could still come true and bring it all crashing down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if you were waiting for companies to back-pedal on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">the trillions of dollars in projected infrastructure spending</a>…you may be waiting for a while.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal flow is now extending to those critical suppliers in the nuclear industry. And <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.standardnuclear.com\">Standard Nuclear</a>, which makes nuclear fuel to feed those reactors, is one of them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it has raised $140 million in a Series A round led by Decisive Point with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Chevron Technology Ventures, Crucible Capital, Fundomo, StepStone Group, Washington Harbour Partners, Welara, and XTX Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was completed in two tranches of $70 million each after Standard Nuclear hit milestones sooner than expected in the wake of President Donald Trump’s nuclear-related executive orders last year, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round comes seven months after Standard Nuclear <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/standard-nuclear-emerges-from-the-ashes-of-a-failed-startup/\">emerged from “stealth” with $42 million</a> in funding. Air quotes are required here; Standard Nuclear is built on the ashes of the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), which went bankrupt in October 2024. The bankrupt company had been working to commercialize a nuclear fuel called TRi-structural ISOtropic particle fuel, or TRISO, for years. Decisive Point’s founder, Thomas Hendrix, bought USNC’s fuel-related assets in the bankruptcy auction for $28 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TRISO fuel was originally conceptualized in the 1950s. Uranium particles about the size of a poppy seed are coated in ceramic and carbon. Those are then packed into larger spheres. Altogether, the design of the fuel pellets is supposed to be more resistant to melting down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TRISO isn’t widely used today. And yet, many nuclear startups say they’ll be using TRISO in their reactors. Standard Nuclear has said it has $100 million in non-binding sales for 2027. Its customers include Radiant Energy, another Decisive Point portfolio company, and Nano Nuclear Energy, which bought USNC’s reactor assets.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Standard Nuclear’s years of experience could put it in the lead.

It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-growing-number-of-republicans-criticize-trump-admin-response/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growing number of Republicans have begun to call for</a> an investigation, as well. (Amodei’s sister and Anthropic’s president Daniela Amodei <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniela-amodei-790bb22a_im-horrified-and-sad-to-see-what-has-happened-activity-7421695432667553792-w7Gx/?utm_medium=ios_app&amp;rcm=ACoAAAFOCx8BxhX6-8vVp2wm8_znw5rioYX7NR4&amp;utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_campaign=copy_link\">posted on LinkedIn</a> that she was “horrified and sad to see what has happened in Minnesota. “What we’ve been witnessing over the past days is not what America stands for,” she wrote.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">J.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year; OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\">$100 billion at an $830 billion valuation</a>, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/sequoia-joins-gic-coatue-in-25b-anthropic-funding-at-350b-valuation-ft/ar-AA1UszTG?apiversion=v2&amp;domshim=1&amp;noservercache=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1#:~:text=Venture%20capital%20firm%20Sequoia%20Capital,Cisco%20(CSCO)%20and%20YouTube.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$25 billion at a $350 billion valuation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, such words of praise for Trump is an about-face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">own blog</a>:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/anthropics-ceo-stuns-davos-with-nvidia-criticism/\">calling the decision “crazy”</a> last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spokespeople from Anthropic and OpenAI confirmed that neither company has contracts with ICE, but did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for more information.

This reduction comes after the e-commerce company laid <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/amazon-to-cut-14000-corporate-jobs/\">off 14,000 people in October</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a letter to employees, Senior VP of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, said that these layoffs were made for “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.” She noted that the reason for the second round of massive layoffs within three months was that several teams in the company hadn’t finished their restructuring.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Galetti didn’t outright deny that there might be more job slashes in the company, but said that the company is not trying to create a pattern of large layoffs every few months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate,” she said in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026\">a blog post</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October, Amazon said that it had 1.57 million employees, and had registered single-digit growth in the past five quarters prior to that, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\">according to the company’s Q3 2025 filings</a>. The company is set to publish its Q4 2025 results next week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its latest blog post, Galetti said that despite these job cuts, the company will continue to hire in strategic areas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a memo that said because of AI, the company will need fewer people “doing some ofthe jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” He also indicated that the company’s corporate workforce will see a reduction in the next few years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon sent an erroneous meeting invite to numerous AWS employees that addressed job cuts and a “Project Dawn” initiative, confusing workers, as reported by Business Insider. The invite was canceled shortly after. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, Amazon said that it is closing its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/amazon-is-closing-its-physical-amazon-go-and-amazon-fresh-stores/\">physical Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh Stores</a> to concentrate on increasing capacity for same-day grocery delivery.

In anticipation of that big event, the company has launched a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., focused solely on further developing the glasses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap announced the new company on Tuesday, explaining that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment” as it continues to iterate on its product. It shows that, like other tech giants (see: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\">Meta</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/03/apple-vision-pro-review-the-infinite-desktop/\">Apple</a>), Snap is getting serious about its smart glasses—although it’s worth noting that the company has been developing its AR hardware for quite a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, Snap originally began working on the technology behind Specs over a decade ago, although the last time the company offered a consumer version of the glasses <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/snapchat-spectacles-2018/\">was in 2018</a>. Since 2024, the latest version of the hardware (technically its fifth generation) has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/17/snaps-extremely-large-spectacles-bring-impressive-ar-to-developers-at-99-a-month/\">a developer-only product</a>, which has allowed Snap to work on populating the wearable with the kinds of programs that will hopefully make it a hit when it comes time to launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Snap has continued to refine its product, other companies have charged to the front of the AR glasses race, most notably Meta—which has cut deals with major eyewear companies (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/?srsltid=AfmBOorDg1-iMererInvZnDlZ2h7GVQUHj-UqPy96Fa6ueFs2eo0FaJg\">Ray Ban and Oakley</a> via its partnership with those brands’ owner, EssilorLuxottica) while enjoying <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-pause.html\">growing demand in the U.S.</a> Snap obviously hopes to make a meaningful entrance into that market once its glasses are released later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES earlier this month, I met up with Russell Patton, product manager for Specs, who gave me the opportunity to demo Snap’s new headgear. Patton, who guided me through a tour of the device’s user experience and latest features, said that “the spatial nature” of Specs meant that there were a lot of user experiences that could be enjoyed that aren’t possible with a phone. That spatial experience is largely powered by the glasses’ four cameras, which allow for hand tracking and enable the company’s Snap Spatial Engine, which is the software component that projects the device’s AR imagery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specs run on a distinct operating system, Snap OS, which released <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-snap-os-2.0\">its latest version</a> last September. The newest version notably includes an improved browser (which I was able to test-drive by visiting the TechCrunch website), as well as an AI-powered function (dubbed “spatial tips”) that can provide auto-generated information about whatever you happen to be looking at (while staring at a table full of snacks, the glasses gave me tips for which were the healthiest). Also included is a “travel mode,” which Snap says can help travelers translate foreign street signs and menus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there are the games. During my demo, I managed to flail my way through a round of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, which was quite a lot of fun. The headsets also have the ability to synchronize with one another, meaning that two different people wearing different sets of glasses can see the same thing in the same physical space. As you might imagine, that opens the door for collaborative gaming.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The form factor of the glasses I used was a bit cumbersome (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/sps-2024-spectacles-snapos\">at nearly 8 ounces</a>, they’re a bit heavy), and it had a propensity to heat up after usage, although the team told me that the particular pair of glasses I was using had been in use all day. The physical makeup of the hardware is also expected to change before it launches publicly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hasn’t provided a firm release date yet, so interested consumers will have to keep their eyes peeled for that announcement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round included a new strategic investment by Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More investors, including newcomer Google, have piled in since, pushing the Series E to $425 million, the company said. Existing investors Capricorn and Goldman Sachs have also returned with fresh investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s valuation was not publicly disclosed, but a source familiar with the round told TechCrunch its post-money valuation was north of $6 billion, more than a billion higher than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/redwood-materials-raises-1b-to-expand-us-battery-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its previous valuation</a>. This latest investment pushes Redwood’s total capital raised to $4.9 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The attraction for Google, Nvidia, and others in this latest round appears to be energy storage — and its ability to power data centers — a newer business venture within Redwood.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Redwood Materials</a> was founded in 2017 to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries and laptop computers. Redwood processes that scrap and extracts materials that are traditionally mined, like nickel and lithium. The newly processed materials are then sold to customers such as Panasonic, which use them to make batteries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Redwood has continued to expand its business beyond recycling. The Carson City, Nevada-based company added cathode production several years ago, and last summer, launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/redwood-materials-launches-energy-storage-business-and-its-first-target-is-ai-data-centers/\">an energy-storage business</a> that repurposes EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled and turns them into micro-grids that can supply power to AI data centers and large-scale industrial sites.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That new business, called Redwood Energy, got its start as the demand for data centers skyrocketed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As electricity demand surges — driven by AI, data centers, manufacturing and electrification — energy storage is no longer optional; it is essential infrastructure,” the company said in a blog post announcing the new funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Redwood seems to have the means to power at least some of those data centers. The company said in June it recovers more than 70% of all used or discarded battery packs in North America, many of which can have a second life as energy storage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Redwood said last year it had more than 1 gigawatt-hour worth in its inventory and expected to receive another 4 gigawatt-hours over the coming months.

The companies did not provide a timeline for such a large-scale deployment.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership represents a bet that the startup’s AI technology can succeed where others have struggled – scaling across multiple self-driving verticals with a single technology stack. While competitors like Waymo previously attempted both robotaxis and trucking before shutting down its freight program, Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun says her company’s capital-efficient approach and generalizable AI architecture give it a unique advantage to tackle both markets simultaneously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our incredible core technology really enables, for the first time, a single solution that can do multiple verticals, and they can do them at scale,” Urtasun told TechCrunch. “It’s not about two programs, two stacks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up brings Urtasun’s work full circle: she previously served as chief scientist at Uber’s autonomous vehicle division, Uber ATG, which Uber sold to self-driving trucking firm Aurora Innovation in 2020. It also builds on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/waabi-and-uber-freight-partner-to-accelerate-autonomous-trucking/\">Waabi’s existing partnership with Uber Freight</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi is one of several AV companies that Uber has brought on to deploy self-driving vehicles on its platform globally. Other companies include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/waymo-and-uber-prepare-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-atlanta-this-summer/\">Waymo</a>, Nuro, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/uber-and-avride-launch-robotaxi-service-in-dallas/\">Avride</a>, Wayve, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/uber-and-weride-launch-robotaxi-service-in-abu-dhabi/\">WeRide</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/ubers-latest-autonomous-vehicle-partner-chinese-startup-momenta/\">Momenta</a>, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up and funding round come as Uber <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/uber-launches-an-av-labs-division-to-gather-driving-data-for-robotaxi-partners/\">launches a new division called Uber AV Labs</a> that will use its vehicles to collect data for AV partners.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi isn’t as reliant on data as some, if Urtasun is to be believed. The Waabi Driver is trained, tested, and validated using a closed-loop simulator called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/09/waabis-new-simulator-could-scale-autonomous-vehicle-tech-faster/\">Waabi World</a> that automatically builds digital twins of the world from data; performs real-time sensor simulation; manufactures scenarios to stress-test the Waabi Driver; and teaches the Driver to learn from its mistakes without human intervention. The result? Waabi’s Driver can reason about its surroundings as a human would and choose the best maneuver, says Urtasun. This allows the system to generalize and learn from fewer examples than traditional autonomous driving systems. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087058\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waabi_Raquel_Urtasun_2.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Waabi</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi has spent the last four and a half years bringing that technology to life for highway and surface street capabilities with trucks, but Urtasun says the Waabi Brain already generalizes to different vehicle form factors – she has even hinted at the company’s next vertical being robotics. From the beginning, the company collected and simulated passenger car data alongside its trucking work, a signal that robotaxis were always part of the long-term plan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The approach has allowed Waabi to build faster and cheaper than competitors, Urtasun claims. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t need the gazillion humans to develop the technology and the large fleets that AV 1.0 needs,” Urtasun said. “We don’t need the massive data centers, energy consumption, or a gazillion latest chips.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal brings Waabi’s total funding raised to roughly $1.28 billion after it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/waabis-genai-promises-to-do-so-much-more-than-power-self-driving-trucks/\">closed a $200 million Series B</a> in June 2024. Competitors Aurora Innovation and Kodiak Robotics have raised $3.46 billion and $448 million to date, respectively, through a combination of venture capital and public-market proceeds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In just five years, Waabi has launched several commercial pilots (with a human driver in the front seat) in Texas. The company had planned to launch a fully driverless truck on public highways by the end of last year, but the rollout has been delayed until sometime in the next few quarters, per Urtasun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi is working with Volvo to build purpose-built autonomous trucks, which the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/waabi-unveils-autonomous-truck-made-in-partnership-with-volvo/\">revealed last October at TechCrunch Disrupt</a>. Urtasun says Waabi’s Driver is ready to go, but the trucks still need to be fully validated before launch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urtasun’s not worried, though. She says there’s plenty of demand for Waabi’s trucks due to the company’s direct-to-consumer model that enables shippers to buy the outfitted trucks directly, and she’s confident that with the Uber partnership, Waabi will be able to “quickly penetrate the market and scale with a product that will be very reliable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re still in the first innings of deployment of robotaxis,” she said. “There’s a lot more scale to come.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urtasun wouldn’t share more specifics about the Uber rollout, like what automaker Waabi would partner with. She did say that Waabi would take a similar route to its autonomous trucking rollout by building its sensors and technology into the vehicle from the factory floor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe in vertically integrating with a fully redundant platform from the OEM,” she said.  “That is how you really build safe and truly scalable technology.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other investors in Waabi’s Series C include Uber, NVentures (Nvidia’s VC arm), Volvo Group Venture Capital, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, BlackRock, BDC Capital’s Thrive Venture Fund, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature, which Google first launched for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/20/you-can-now-talk-to-google-photos-to-make-your-edits/\">Pixel 10 users in the U.S.</a> last August, lets people describe the changes they want to make to their photos rather than manually adjusting sliders or learning complex editing software.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users in these newly supported countries will now see a “Help me Edit” box when they tap the edit option on a photo. From there, they can either select from suggested prompts or type their own requests in plain language. For example, you could ask the app to “remove the motorcycle in the background,” “reduce the background blur,” or use a more general command like “restore this old photo.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI can handle surprisingly specific requests too. You can ask it to edit a friend’s pose, remove their glasses, or even have them open their eyes in a photo where they blinked. The feature uses Google’s Nano Banana image model to transform photos, and all the processing happens directly within the app without requiring an internet connection for the actual editing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p><p>The feature will work on any Android device with at least 4GB of RAM running Android 8.0 or higher, meaning it’s not limited to Google’s own Pixel phones. Along with this geographic expansion, Google is also adding language support beyond English, including Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Bengali, and Gujarati, making the tool accessible to millions more users in their native languages.\n\n</p><p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also rolling out C2PA Content Credentials support in Google Photos for these countries. This metadata  will indicate when an image was created or edited using AI. As AI-generated and AI-edited images become more common, social media platforms have been grappling with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/meta-tagging-real-photos-made-with-ai/\">how to label AI content</a>, and credentials like C2PA help users understand what they’re looking at.<br><br>The expansion is the latest in Google’s aggressive push to integrate AI throughout Google Photos. Last November, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/11/google-photos-adds-new-ai-features-for-editing-expands-ai-powered-search-to-over-100-countries/\">expanded AI-powered search</a> capabilities to over 100 countries with support for more than 17 languages. It also introduced AI templates that can convert photos into different artistic styles. Just last week, Google rolled out a “Meme me” feature that lets users combine reference templates with their own images to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/google-photos-latest-feature-lets-you-meme-yourself/\">create memes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company raised about ₹19.07 billion (about $208.24 million) in its initial public offering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shares fell about 9% from the offer price of ₹124 to ₹112.60 on Wednesday, valuing the Bengaluru-based logistics firm at roughly ₹64.7 billion (about $706.58 million) on debut, roughly matching its last private valuation of close to ₹60 billion (roughly $655.01 million) in early 2025. The offering, priced in a band of ₹118–124 per share, combined a fresh issue with an offer-for-sale by existing shareholders and was subscribed <a href=\"https://www.jmfinancialservices.in/market-news-and-insights/1666943\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nearly three times</a> over.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2015, Shadowfax <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/shadowfax-speeds-ahead-with-100m-funding-as-instant-delivery-boom-fuels-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">operates as a third-party logistics provider</a>, handling last-mile and intra-city deliveries for e-commerce marketplaces, quick-commerce platforms and consumer internet companies across India. The company counts e-commerce players including Flipkart and Meesho, as well as quick-commerce and food delivery platforms Zepto and Zomato, among its largest clients, which together account for about 74% of its revenue, according to its prospectus. Its key shareholders include Flipkart, TPG NewQuest, Qualcomm, and the World Bank-backed International Finance Corporation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shadowfax’s listing comes as the e-commerce and quick-commerce sectors continue to expand in India, driven by rising internet penetration, urbanization, and demand for faster deliveries. Platforms offering same-day or rapid fulfillment have increasingly leaned on third-party logistics providers to scale nationally, placing companies like Shadowfax at the centre of the country’s consumer internet supply chain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The offering includes shares sold by some early and institutional backers, including Flipkart, Eight Roads Ventures, Nokia Growth Partners, Qualcomm, and Mirae Asset. Founders Abhishek Bansal and Vaibhav Khandelwal are not participating in the offer-for-sale and will together retain about 20% of the company after listing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t see this IPO as a destination,” said Bansal, Shadowfax’s co-founder and CEO, during its IPO launch ceremony in Mumbai. “We are not building this for the next quarter. We are building this for the next century. Today, we don’t ring a bell. We are waking up to a new set of possibilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the six months ended September 2025, Shadowfax reported revenue from operations of ₹18.06 billion (about $197.12 million), up 68% from the same period a year earlier, per its prospectus. The company’s profit more than doubled year over year to ₹210.37 million (around $2.30 million), reflecting higher delivery volumes, though earnings remain closely tied to demand from a small group of large platform clients.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shadowfax plans to use proceeds from the fresh issue to fund capital expenditure for its network infrastructure, pay lease costs for new first-mile, last-mile and sorting centres, and meet branding, marketing and communication expenses, its prospectus said. A portion of the proceeds will also be kept for inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently operates around 3.5 million square feet of logistics infrastructure across 14,700 pin codes nationwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shadowfax’s IPO comes more than three years after its larger rival, Delhivery, went public in 2022.

The newly formed entity, “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC,” licenses TikTok’s recommendation algorithm from ByteDance and independently manages content moderation, and oversees data protection, algorithm security, and software controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The managing investor group consists of Oracle, the private equity firm Silver Lake, and the investment firm MGX. Each holds a 15% stake, totaling 45% of the U.S. business. Here’s what you should know about them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-oracle\">Oracle</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oracle is a leading cloud computing and database firm that collaborates with top companies, such as OpenAI. Oracle previously attempted to acquire TikTok and already provides cloud infrastructure for the app, managing its U.S. user data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the new deal, Oracle serves as the security partner, auditing TikTok’s compliance with U.S. security requirements, managing data storage, and overseeing updates to the content recommendation algorithm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to note that Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, now the company’s executive chairman and chief technology officer, is a prominent billionaire with known connections to President Trump. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mgx\">MGX</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MGX is an AI-focused investment firm based in the United Arab Emirates, which invests in semiconductors and data centers. The firm was created by Mubadala (Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund) and G42, an Emirati AI company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MGX’s stake in U.S. TikTok could give the firm influence over key decisions shaping TikTok’s AI direction. The firm already backs Elon Musk’s xAI, Anthropic, and OpenAI, and contributed to a $100 billion AI data center initiative announced by President Trump, in which Oracle is participating as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also worth pointing out that MGX has partnerships with Microsoft and BlackRock.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-silver-lake\">Silver Lake</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silver Lake, a leading U.S. private equity firm, has long invested heavily in technology companies, including Airbnb, Twitter, Dell Technologies, Tesla, and Waymo. Its role in U.S. TikTok is primarily financial and strategic, offering capital and expertise to help shape the platform’s direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Silver Lake has collaborated with MGX in the past, including during the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mgx.ae/en/news/mgx-joins-silver-lake-altera-acquisition\">acquisition</a> of a majority stake in the software and chip company Altera last year.

But before you jump on the bandwagon, here’s what you need to know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to its tagline, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) is the “AI that actually does things” — whether it’s managing your calendar, sending messages through your favorite apps, or checking you in for flights. This promise has drawn thousands of users willing to tackle the technical setup required, even though it started as a scrappy personal project built by one developer for his own use.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That man is Peter Steinberger, an Austrian <a href=\"https://x.com/TrendingTopicsA/status/2015693268944650570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">developer and founder</a> who is known online as <a href=\"https://steipete.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">@steipete</a> and actively blogs about his work. After stepping away from his previous project, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/pspdfkit-raises-116m-its-first-outside-money-now-nearly-1b-people-use-apps-powered-by-its-collaboration-signing-and-markup-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PSPDFkit</a>, Steinberger felt empty and barely touched his computer for three years, he explained on his blog. But he eventually <a href=\"https://steipete.me/posts/2025/finding-my-spark-again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">found his spark again</a> — which led to Moltbot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Moltbot is now much more than a solo project, the publicly available version still derives from <a href=\"https://www.clawd.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Clawd</a>, “Peter’s crusted assistant,” now called Molty, a tool he built to help him “manage his digital life” and “explore what human-AI collaboration can be.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Steinberger, this meant diving deeper into the momentum around AI that had reignited his builder spark. <a href=\"https://steipete.me/posts/just-one-more-prompt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A self-confessed “Claudoholic”</a>, he initially named his project after Anthropic’s AI flagship product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/25/claude-everything-you-need-to-know-about-anthropics-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Claude</a>. He revealed on X that Anthropic subsequently <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2016079236780449975\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">forced him</a> to change the branding for copyright reasons. TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic for comment. But the project’s “lobster soul” <a href=\"https://x.com/moltbot/status/2016058924403753024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remains unchanged</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To its early adopters, Moltbot represents the vanguard of how helpful AI assistants could be. Those who were already excited at the prospect of using AI to quickly generate websites and apps are even more keen to have their personal AI assistant perform tasks for them. And just like Steinberger, they’re eager to tinker with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This explains how Moltbot amassed more than 44,200 stars <a href=\"https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on GitHub</a> so quickly. So much viral attention has been paid Moltbot that it has even moved markets. Cloudflare’s stock <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/cloudflare-surges-viral-ai-agent-buzz-lifts-expectations-2026-01-27/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">surged 14%</a> in premarket trading on Tuesday as social media buzz around the AI agent resparked investor enthusiasm for Cloudflare’s infrastructure, which developers use to run Moltbot locally on their devices.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, it’s a long way from breaking out of early adopter territory, and maybe that’s for the best. Installing Moltbot requires being tech savvy, and that also includes awareness of the inherent security risks that come with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On one hand, Moltbot is built with safety in mind: It is open source, meaning anyone can inspect its code for vulnerabilities, and it runs on your computer or server, not in the cloud. But on the other hand, its very premise is inherently risky. As entrepreneur and investor Rahul Sood <a href=\"https://x.com/rahulsood/status/2015397582105969106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pointed out on X</a>, “‘actually doing things’ means ‘can execute arbitrary commands on your computer.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What keeps Sood up at night is “prompt injection through content” — where a malicious person could send you a WhatsApp message that could lead Moltbot to take unintended actions on your computer without your intervention or knowledge. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That risk can be mitigated partly by careful setup. Since Moltbot supports various AI models, users may want to make setup choices based on their resistance to these kinds of attacks. But the only way to fully prevent it is to run Moltbot in a silo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This may be obvious to experienced developers tinkering with a weeks-old project, but some of them have become more vocal in warning users attracted by the hype: things could turn ugly fast if they approach it as carelessly as ChatGPT. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger himself was served with a reminder that malicious actors exist when he “messed up” the renaming of his project. He complained on X that “crypto scammers” <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2016073406840476131\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">snatched his GitHub</a> username and created fake cryptocurrency projects in his name, and he warned followers that “any project that lists [him] as coin owner is a SCAM.” He then posted that the GitHub issue <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2016102509324984572\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">had been fixed</a> but cautioned that the legitimate X account is @moltbot, “not any of the 20 scam variations of it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This doesn’t necessarily mean you should stay away from Moltbot at this stage if you are curious to test it. But if you have never heard of a VPS — a virtual private server, which is essentially a remote computer you rent to run software — you may want to wait your turn. (That’s where you may want to run Moltbot for now. “Not the laptop with your SSH keys, API credentials, and password manager,” Sood cautioned.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, running Moltbot safely means running it on a separate computer with throwaway accounts, which defeats the purpose of having a useful AI assistant. And fixing that security-versus-utility trade-off may require solutions that are beyond Steinberger’s control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, by building a tool to solve his own problem, Steinberger showed the developer community what AI agents could actually accomplish and how autonomous AI might finally become genuinely useful rather than just impressive.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Though the discount applies to all users, the service is geared toward those renting ski gear. By Rotation said that 30% of the ski renters on its platform look for same-day pickup, and this partnership seeks to alleviate the annoyance of renting bulky, expensive ski gear and having to lug it around.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership is fun and timely. Previously, By Rotation teamed up with Airbnb to provide rental wedding outfits for guests attending destination weddings. It was another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/30/airbnb-and-fashion-app-by-rotation-partner-for-free-destination-wedding-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creative collaboration</a> that sought to meet consumers where they are. Right now, ski clothing has become quite the fashion symbol online as the sport <a href=\"https://www.saminfo.com/news/sam-headline-news/4763-116-uk-skier-numbers-up-7-last-season\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remains a popular</a> pastime across Europe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eshita Kabra-Davies, the founder and CEO of By Rotation, told TechCrunch that the partnership came from “listening to our community,” and that the company realized that, though consumers love how sustainable renting clothing can be, they also wanted the “speed and convenience of e-commerce.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With one in four rentals made within 48 hours of an event, logistics was the final friction point,” she said. She called this the “emergency economy,” or the moment of “satorical panic” when someone realized they needed an outfit immediately. Usually, when this moment comes, a person has to run out to make a “panic purchase” for a new outfit. “We have wanted to change this behavior by removing the one thing standing in the way — logistics,” Kabra-Davies said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teaming up with Uber makes consumers move from “fast fashion” to “slow fashion,” she said. Fashion remains one of the <a href=\"https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most polluting industries</a> in the world. As a result, the sharing economy — or the circular economy —<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/style/depop-gen-z.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has become popular among young people</a> looking for more sustainable, and often more affordable, ways to buy clothing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When users renting in their neighborhoods go to the app’s checkout page, they will be prompted via a pop-up banner to use Uber Courier, where the By Rotation discount will automatically be applied. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It gives our community the luxury of choice; they can now secure a high-quality, high-value piece over a disposable garment, simply because it can reach their door just as quickly,” Kabra-Davies continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kabra-Davies launched By Rotation in 2019 and has scaled it into one of the world’s largest peer-to-peer rental platforms. The platform has more than 1 million users (like song writer Ellie Goulding), she said, and it manages luxury inventory worth more than $100 million. With this, the company has expanded beyond being a fashion rental platform, Kabra-Davies said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A powerful example is one of our top lenders who actually used her wardrobe earnings to fund <a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/fashion-rental-paid-for-ivf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">her IVF journey</a>, which has led to successful surrogacy,” she said. Next, the brand hopes to keep building the “world’s largest shared wardrobe.” It’s already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/01/by-rotation-seed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched in New York</a> and has its eyes on the UAE. “Our ambition, like Uber’s, is global,”  Kabra-Davies said. “We want to make the ‘rotating wardrobe’ the default mode of consumption everywhere.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rather than humans operating drones, the drones must operate autonomously. The humans will be tested on their software-writing skills that cause the drones to outfly their competition.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are prizes ranging from a $500,000 pot to be spilt amongst the highest-scoring teams, to jobs at Anduril and a chance to bypass the company’s standard recruiting cycle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was something that I decided we should do,” Luckey said in an interview with TechCrunch. Luckey and the team were meeting to discuss recruitment strategy, he recalled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Someone suggested sponsoring a drone-racing tournament, which was somewhat in line with the company’s previous marketing tactics. For instance, Anduril sponsors the NASCAR Cup Series race known as the <a href=\"https://www.anduril.com/news/anduril-250-race-the-base-nascar-cup-series-street-race-to-headline-nascar-san-diego-weekend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anduril 250</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luckey generally liked the idea but then told the team, “‘Guys, that would be a really dumb thing for Anduril to sponsor. The whole point, our entire impetus and reason for being, is this pitch that autonomy has finally advanced to where you don’t have to have a person micromanaging each drone,’” he recalled, then added, “‘What we should really do is sponsor a race that’s about how well programmers and engineers can make a drone fly itself.’” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After discovering that such an event didn’t exist, the company opted to create it themselves. Interestingly, though, Luckey pointed out that the teams in the AI Grand Prix will not be flying Anduril’s drones, but those built by another defense tech startup: <a href=\"https://www.neros.tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Neros Technologies</a>. According to Luckey, Anduril’s drones are too physically big to run in the contained course in Ohio where the finals will take place.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We talked about having teams use Anduril drones, but Anduril doesn’t make any drones that are of the ultra-high speed, very small nature that you would want for a Drone Racing League. It’s mostly bigger stuff,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anduril is also partnering with one of the established racing leagues, the Drone Champions League, to operate the event, as well as JobsOhio. The final race will take place in Ohio (where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/palmer-luckey-says-the-coolest-thing-about-anduril-expanding-to-long-beach-is-the-fighter-jets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anduril’s key manufacturing facility</a> is located). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Luckey is clearly excited about how fun the event will be, he won’t be a racer himself. “I absolutely will be there,” he says, but “it’s going to be about who can build the best software to pilot these drones.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He smiled and said, “I’m not actually a very good software programmer. I’m more of a hardware guy. I’m an electromechanical and optical guy, and I know just enough about coding to glue stuff together in a way that works for my prototypes.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Luckey calls Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf “our de facto lead software brains” at the company.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founder is hoping for at least 50 teams, and already has interest from multiple universities, he said. Should this competition be a successful event, the plan is to expand it into races with the other types of autonomous vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are starting with these quadcopter racing drones, which is what people expect from drone racing. However, we want to be, in the future, applying AI racing to other platforms as well,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Underwater AI racing, ground AI racing, potentially even AI racing of spacecraft were some of the ideas Luckey shared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The contest is open to all international entrants, excluding teams from Russia.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The difference with Russia is they are actively engaged in the act of invading Europe,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concern is that the people qualified to enter such a race may also be working for their nation’s military. “I would love to have everybody, but we’re not the Olympics,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luckey said the event was following the lead from the World Cup, which has also excluded Russia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, teams from China (home to a lot of autonomous engineering) are welcome, despite it being the country that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/silicon-valley-is-debating-if-ai-weapons-should-be-allowed-to-decide-to-kill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. autonomous weapons hawks</a> often name as their biggest fear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Should a Chinese team win, the prize of a job at Anduril, which makes weapons used by the U.S. military, would not be a given. “If you work for the Chinese military, you’re not going to be allowed to get a job at Anduril,” Luckey said. Certain laws apply, he pointed out. In fact, there will still be some interviews and a qualification process for all the job candidates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The competition will take place across three qualifying rounds beginning in April, with the final Grand Prix race scheduled for November.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Plus, he wants Bluesky to support posting more than four photos at a time, and thinks threads should be easier to create, too.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The need for private accounts wasn’t addressed, but those will take longer to realize, Bluesky has previously explained. The <a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/issues/1155?timeline_page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plan</a> is for the underlying protocol, the AT Protocol (or AT Proto for short), to <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2025-protocol-roadmap-spring\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eventually</a> support private accounts. But that won’t be coming anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benzer also pointed to improvements to the app’s Discover feed, which could add topic tags as a way to guide people to posts related to their interests. “Who to follow” suggestions will also be improved, as finding high-quality connections can improve the overall user experience.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?w=561\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2915723\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg 1202w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=124,150 124w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=248,300 248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=768,930 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=561,680 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=991,1200 991w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=1057,1280 1057w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=355,430 355w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=594,720 594w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=743,900 743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=660,800 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=551,668 551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=310,375 310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=509,617 509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=438,531 438w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=41,50 41w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky/screenshot of feeds</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benzer believes that Bluesky needs to have more of a “real-time” feel, whether that’s around events like sports, or political moments of interest like elections. The company is building curation tools for its team to make high-quality and timely custom feeds available during live events, he said. The team is exploring other new features within feeds that would make these feeds feel “less like just scrolling through posts and more like hanging out,” Benzer said. (What that means, we’re not exactly sure!)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of growing the overall ecosystem, which the community has dubbed the “Atmosphere,” the company will look to improve interoperability with other apps that are also built on the underlying AT Protocol. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you go live on Twitch or <a href=\"https://stream.place/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Streamplace</a>, another app powered by the AT Protocol, you’ll see a LIVE badge appear on your profile photo on Bluesky.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083342\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=720,432 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=900,540 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=800,480 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=668,401 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=625,375 625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=708,425 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benzer said another integration like this is coming “soon.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bluesky has succeeded in adding users, actual usage on Bluesky ebbs and flows, with surges often timed to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/22/bluesky-saw-record-usage-after-elon-musk-announced-plans-to-charge-all-x-users/\">changes at X</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/bluesky-is-seeing-an-exodus-of-unhappy-x-users-following-the-election/\">moments of political tension</a>. Meanwhile, Meta’s Threads has become the next-nearest competitor to X. New third-party data indicates that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/\">Threads is now outpacing X</a> in daily mobile users, though X was still ahead on the desktop web. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Threads’ main advantage is that it’s backed by the resources of a tech giant, allowing for heavy cross-promotion, easier onboarding, and tons of resources. As a result, Threads has been rapidly shipping new features over the past year or so, including things like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/threads-takes-on-x-with-new-communities-feature/\">interest-based communities</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/threads-now-lets-you-approve-and-filter-your-replies/\">better filters</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/threads-gets-its-own-dms-as-app-distances-itself-from-instagram/\">DMs</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/threads-tests-a-way-to-share-long-form-text-on-the-platform/\">long-form text</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/threads-adds-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours-and-responses-go-to-dms/\">disappearing posts</a>. That’s helped to differentiate it from X and gain traction among users, including those who want a network that favors creator content over politics, which Threads had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/instagram-and-threads-will-no-longer-proactively-recommend-political-content/\">deprioritized</a> up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/meta-to-phase-back-in-political-content-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/\">until a year ago.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
