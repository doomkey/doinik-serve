After a long stretch on GitHub Copilot, Silver is now a corporate vice president at Microsoft’s CoreAI division, where she works on tools for deploying apps and agentic systems within enterprises. Her work is focused on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry\">the Foundry system</a> inside Azure, which is designed as a unified AI portal for enterprises, giving her a close view of how companies are actually using these systems and where deployments end up falling short.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I spoke with Silver about the current capabilities of enterprise agents, and why she believes this is the biggest opportunity for startups since the public cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This interview was edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>So, your work focuses on Microsoft products for outside developers – often startups that aren’t otherwise focused on AI. How do you see AI impacting those companies?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I see this as being a watershed moment for startups as profound as the move to the public cloud. If you think about it, the cloud had a huge impact for startups because it meant that they no longer needed to have the real estate space to host their racks, and they didn’t need to spend as much money on the capital infusion of getting the hardware to be hosted in their labs and things like that. Everything became cheaper. Now agentic AI is going to kind of continue to reduce the overall cost of software operations again, because many of the jobs involved in standing up a new venture — whether it’s support people, legal investigations — a lot of it can be done faster and cheaper with AI agents. I think that’s going to lead to more ventures and more startups launching. And then we’re going to see higher-valuation startups with fewer people at the helm. And I think that that’s an exciting world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What does that look like in practice?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are certainly seeing multi-step agents becoming very broadly used across all different kinds of coding tasks, right? Just as an example, one thing developers have to do to maintain a codebase is stay current with the latest versions of the libraries that it has a dependency on. You might have a dependency on an older version of the dot-net runtime or the Java SDK. And we can have these agentic systems reason over your entire codebase and bring it up to date much more easily, with maybe a 70 or 80% reduction of the time it takes. And it really has to be a deployed multi-step agent to do that.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Live-site operations is another one – if you think of maintaining a website or a service and something goes wrong, there’s a thud in the night, and somebody has to be on call to get woken up to go respond to the incident. We still do have people on call 24/7, just in case the service goes down. But it used to be a really loathed job because you’d get woken up fairly often for these minor incidents. And we’ve now built an genetic system to successfully diagnose and in many cases fully mitigate issues that come up in these live site operations so that humans don’t have to be woken up in the middle of the night and groggily go to their terminals and try to diagnose what’s going on. And that also helps us dramatically reduce the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of the other puzzles of this present moment is that agentic deployments haven’t happened quite as fast as we expected even six months ago. I’m curious why you think that is.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you think about the people who are building agents, what is preventing them from being successful, in many cases, it comes down to not really knowing what the purpose of the agent should be. There’s a culture change that has to happen in how people build these systems. What is the business use case that they are trying to solve for? What are they trying to achieve? You need to be very clear-eyed about what the definition of success is for this agent. And you need to think, what is the data that I’m giving to the agent so that it can reason over how to go accomplish this particular task?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We see those things as the bigger stumbling blocks, more than the general uncertainty of letting agents get deployed. Anybody who goes and looks at these systems sees the return on investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>You mention the general uncertainty, which I think feels like a big blocker from the outside. Why do you see it as less of a problem in practice?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First of all, I think that it’s going to be very common that agentic systems have human-in-the-loop scenarios. Think about something like a package return. It used to be that you would have a workflow for the return processing that was 90% automated and 10% human intervention, where somebody would have to go look at the package and have to make a judgment call as to how damaged the package was before they would decide to accept the return. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a perfect example where actually now the computer vision models are getting so good that in many cases, we don’t need to have as much human oversight over inspecting the package and making that determination. There will still be some cases that are borderline, where maybe the computer vision is not yet good enough to make a call, and maybe there’s an escalation. It’s kind of like, how often do you need to call in the manager? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some things that will always need some kind of human oversight, because they’re such critical operations. Think about incurring a contractual legal obligation, or deploying code into a production codebase that could potentially affect the reliability of your systems. But even then, there’s the question of how far we could get in automating the rest of the process.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/upscrolleds-founder-says-the-social-network-has-zoomed-past-2-5m-users/\">growing to more than 2.5 million users</a> in January, users have reported the app is not taking action on the creation of usernames and hashtags that contain racial slurs, and hasn’t been able to properly moderate harmful content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After receiving tips from UpScrolled users, TechCrunch confirmed the existence of a wide range of racial slurs and hate speech being used in people’s usernames on the app. For instance, some usernames would feature the name of the slur itself, the slur combined with other words, or multiple slurs in a single username; other usernames contain hate speech, like “Glory to Hitler.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After reporting these slurs to UpScrolled’s public email address, we received a response from that email that the company is “actively reviewing and removing inappropriate content,” and is working to expand its moderation capacity. The email advised us not to engage with bad-faith actors while the situation is resolved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Days after reporting this activity on the app, the accounts with slurs in the usernames that were provided to UpScrolled via screenshots remained online. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, slurs and hate speech can be found elsewhere in the app, including hashtags and text used alongside its photo or video content, TechCrunch found. Other harmful content was available, including text posts with racial slurs and hate speech, and photo and video content glorifying Hitler, based on TechCrunch’s review of the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch wasn’t alone in identifying this problem; the ADL also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/article/upscrolled-social-media-platform-attracts-virulent-antisemites-lacks-enforcement\">published a blog post this month</a>, noting that UpScrolled was becoming home to antisemitic and extremist content and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations\">designated</a> foreign terrorist organizations, like Hamas and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UpScrolled, which was founded in 2025, claims on its website claims that the platform offers every voice “equal power.” The app has seen more than 4 million downloads on iOS and Android since June 2025, according to market intelligence provider <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://appfigures.com/\">Appfigures</a> — a figure even higher than the startup’s self-reported number last month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while UpScrolled’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/faq/\">FAQ</a> explains the app doesn’t “censor opinions,” it does indicate that its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/rules-and-policies/\">policy</a> is to restrict content that involves “illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That guidance is similar to most modern-day social media platforms. It’s clear, however, that the company is struggling to enforce its rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s battle that social networks are often faced with — especially those that receive a large influx of new users in a short time period. Bluesky, for instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/bluesky-racial-slurs-banned-list-usernames/\">faced issues with slurs in account usernames in July 2023</a>, which led to users threatening to leave the site.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After UpScrolled’s initial reply to our inquiry, TechCrunch also received a response from the press account on Tuesday, which directed us to UpScrolled founder <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/iHijazi\">Issam Hijazi’s</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2021183174802280576\">new video</a>, where he addressed the issues with content moderation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2021183174802280576\">video</a>, he confirmed that users have been uploading “harmful content” that goes against UpScrolled’s terms of service and the company’s beliefs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are offering everyone the freedom to express and share their opinions in a healthy and respectful digital environment,” Hijazi said. To create that environment, he said the company is “rapidly expanding our content moderation team, and we are upgrading our technology infrastructure so we can catch and remove harmful content more effectively.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

More than half of xAI’s founding team has now left, and the fact that several employees followed within days has intensified scrutiny around the company’s stability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three of the departing staff members say they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others hint at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yuhai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/2021113745024614671\">said in a post</a> announcing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter.

The company is facing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\">regulatory scrutiny</a> after Grok created nonconsensual explicit deepfakes of women and children which were disseminated on X – <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/paris-prosecutors-raid-x-offices-as-part-of-investigation-over-child-abuse-images-deepfakes\">French authorities last week raided X </a>offices as part of an investigation. The company is also moving towards a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">planned IPO </a>later this year, after being <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\">legally acquired by SpaceX</a> last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk is also facing personal controversy after files published by the Justice Department show extended conversations with convicted rapist and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The emails show Musk <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/expressed-interest-visiting-jeffrey-epstein-island-emails-show-doj-rcna256784\">discussing a visit to Epstein’s island</a> on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013. Epstein was first convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI maintains a headcount of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-org-chart-employees-elon-musk-direct-reports-2025-3\">over 1,000 employees</a>, so the departures are unlikely to affect the companies short-term capabilities. Still, the rapid pace of the recent departures has taken on a life of their own online, with users jokingly announcing they too are “leaving xAI” despite never having worked there — a sign of how quickly the narrative of a “mass exodus” has snowballed on Musk’s X.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, co-founder exits are harder to dismiss as routine churn. As Musk continues to consolidate his AI ambitions, their departures raise broader questions about governance and long-term stability at xAI. In frontier AI, where talent is scarce, qualities like reputational gravity and mission clarity matter. The more pressing question may not be how many engineers have left, but whether xAI can maintain the institutional steadiness needed to compete with rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-timeline-of-departure-announcements\"><strong>Timeline of departure announcements:</strong></h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The following employees have publicly announced their departures from xAI on X in recent days:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>February 6:  </strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ayushjaiswal/status/2019857451823296876\">Ayush Jaiswal</a>, engineer, wrote: “This was my last week at xAI.

The NIF is the site of the world’s only controlled fusion reactions <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/17/laser-powered-fusion-experiment-more-than-doubles-its-power-output/\">that have reached scientific breakeven</a>, in which the reaction releases more energy than it took to start. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series A was led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from GV, Modern Capital, Threshold Ventures, and others. Inertia’s co-founders include Jeff Lawson, who co-founded Twilio and served as its CEO, Annie Kircher, who led the successful experiments at NIF, and Mike Dunne, a Stanford professor who helped Lawrence Livermore develop a power plant design based on NIF. Kircher has remained in her position at Lawrence Livermore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NIF’s breakeven experiments have been a key milestones on the road to widespread fusion power. However, considerable progress needs to be made before a fusion power plant can deliver electricity to the grid. For Inertia, that means building a laser capable of delivering 10 kilojoules ten times per second.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s reactor relies on a form of fusion known as inertial confinement. In Inertia’s flavor of inertial confinement, lasers bombard a fuel target, compressing the fuel until atoms inside fuse and release energy. The technique is based on NIF’s designs, in which laser light is converted into X-rays inside the target. The X-rays are what ultimately heat and compress the fuel pellet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each of Inertia’s power plants will require 1,000 of its lasers bombarding 4.5 mm targets that cost less than $1 each to mass produce. By contrast, the NIF’s system uses 192 lasers to fire on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/keys-to-success/targets\">painstakingly crafted</a> targets that take dozens of hours to make. Inertia is betting that by using the same basic principles as NIF and applying a more commercial mindset, it can bring the costs down dramatically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inertia’s new round is the latest in a string of funding announcements from fusion startups in recent months. With this round and others, fusion startups have attracted more than $10 billion in investments. And at least a dozen companies have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/%5D/\">raised more than $100 million</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, Avalanche said it had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/avalanche-thinks-the-fusion-power-industry-should-think-smaller/\">raised $29 million to advance its desktop-sized fusion reactor</a>.

General Fusion said in January it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/struggling-fusion-power-company-general-fusion-to-go-public-via-1b-reverse-merger/\">merge with acquisition company Spring Valley III</a> in a deal that values the combined company at $1 billion.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Sam Blond left his job as a VC for Founders Fund a year ago — just 18 months after he started — he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/04/brex-sam-blond-leaves-founders-fund/\">told the world</a> that being a VC wasn’t for him and he was “going back to operating.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, he officially brought his new startup, <a href=\"https://www.monaco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Monaco</a>, out of stealth. It was co-founded with his brother Brian Blond, who is also an ex-sales professional turned VC. (Brian is a partner at Human Capital and was formerly at Sutter Hill.) The brothers are joined by two other co-founders, Abishek Viswanathan (previously CPO at Apollo and Qualtrics), and Malay Desai (formerly SVP of engineering at Clari). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Monaco has raised a total of $35 million, between a $10 million seed and $25 million Series A round, Sam Blond tells TechCrunch. Both rounds were led by Founders Fund, with participation from Human Capital. The startup has been quietly testing its AI sales platform through a private beta for a while, but on Wednesday opened it up to a public beta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The well-connected Blond brothers (Sam was previously head of sales at Brex), also attracted a bunch of big-name angels as backers: Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Y Combinator chief Garry Tan, and Greenoaks Capital founder Neil Mehta.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what attracted such a venerable list of investors? Monaco is entering the crowded field of AI sales tech with a twist. It isn’t just competing with SaaS-era tech via its AI-native alternative; it’s also supplying experienced human salespeople to be experts in the AI loop, monitoring and guiding the AI’s work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is targeting young seed and Series A-level startups with a product suite that includes an AI-native customer relationship management (CRM) system and a built-from-scratch ZoomInfo-like database for finding prospects. Its AI agents can create and execute email outreach campaigns and draft follow-up emails all monitored by the human experts. It includes other features, too, like a meeting notetaker. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The product is intended to automate much of the sales grunt work. “We can replace full workflows with agents,” Blond says (pictured above, third from left, with brother Brian, pictured second from left). For instance, Monaco builds a database of prospects, identifies the exact people at a target company to pitch, and the sequence in which to target them. “We orchestrate and execute that sequence. We schedule a meeting,” Blond says. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The human-in-the-loop salespeople help ensure that the AI isn’t hallucinating and train it to sell the product, and the actual customer meetings are done by the people. No avatars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That makes Monaco a rare AI sales startup that isn’t <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\">talking about</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/6sense-founder-amanda-kahlow-raises-30-million-for-new-human-replacement-ai-sales-startup-1mind/\">human replacement</a>. Instead, it’s making experienced salespeople available to companies too nascent to hire them directly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s this combination of the technology, but also the service,” Blond says. “Monaco does not have an agent pretending to be a sales rep trying to sell to the customer.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Monaco’s main competition is HubSpot, priced as it is to be more affordable for young companies than the big kahuna of the market, Salesforce. Blond declined to tell us what Monaco will charge, except to say that it’s a flat fee and currently discounted while the product remains in beta.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’s also well aware that he’s in an exceptionally crowded market. Y Combinator alone has graduated hundreds of sales startups in the past couple of years, ranging from AI CRMs to niche AI tools. Then there’s startups like Attio, Clay, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/how-2-uc-berkeley-dropouts-raised-28m-for-their-ai-marketing-automation-startup/\">Conversion,</a> and the crop of so-called AI SDR (sales-development representative) tools — human-replacement agentic startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/11x-ceo-hasan-sukkar-steps-down/\">11x</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/yes-linkedin-banned-ai-agent-startup-artisan-but-now-its-back/\">Artisan</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/6sense-founder-amanda-kahlow-raises-30-million-for-new-human-replacement-ai-sales-startup-1mind/\">1mind</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, the incumbents, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, and ZoomInfo, are all offering their own AI and agentic tools.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blond points out that today’s top players were built in another era, and none of the upstarts are performing well enough to be a clear-cut winner. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There definitely is not the ‘Cursor for sales’,” he says, referring to the popular AI coding tool. “But there will be.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He obviously wants Monaco to be that winner. “In the broad category of sales technology, there’s a market leader right now. That market leader is Salesforce,” Blond says. “We are in the early innings of the next platform shift that will lead to a new market leader.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, out of all the areas he could have entered after leaving Founders Fund, why duke it out among so much competition?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blond, speaking earnestly, says that having spent his entire career in sales, “As a non-technical founder, there’s really only one type of technology company that I’m qualified to be the founder of: a sales technology company.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’s clearly having fun doing so. The company employs about 40 people and the office, filled with fellow career salespeople, sports WWII-esque motivational posters on the wall with slogans like “Save Startups” and “Build the future with Monaco.” There’s even an office gong that rings out every time the AI lands a meeting with a prospect. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Less than a year later, they were sleeping in a camper on the side of a Canadian corn field building their robotics startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waterloo, Ontario-based Upside Robotics builds lightweight solar-powered autonomous robots that deliver right-sized amounts of fertilizer and nutrients to crops when they need it. The company’s software runs on proprietary algorithms to decipher when and how much fertilizer the plants need using weather and soil data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upside’s robots currently work on corn plants — one of the most fertilizer-intensive crops — which was chosen by Upside for that exact reason, Jana Tian, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Tian and Sam Dugan, co-founder and chief technology officer, met at the Entrepreneurs First accelerator, they decided to focus on reducing fertilizer waste using robots because it fit squarely into the center of the Venn diagram of their interests. It also leaned well toward their backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dugan had been building robots since he was 10 years old and Tian had years of experience as a chemical engineer in the food division at Unilever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customer discovery with farmers further confirmed this was an area farmers were willing to pay for a better way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Traditionally, the way the fertilizer has been applied, only 30% of the total fertilizer gets taken by the crop, so a majority of it gets wasted,” Tian said. “Farmers usually do one application per season, so they have to front-load a lot of the fertilizer. But the crops need the fertilizer during the season as well. We knew there was that problem that a lot of our growers really wanted different solutions to.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?w=532\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091874\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg 1603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=117,150 117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=235,300 235w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=768,981 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=532,680 532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=939,1200 939w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=1002,1280 1002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=337,430 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=564,720 564w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=704,900 704w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=626,800 626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=1202,1536 1202w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=523,668 523w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=294,375 294w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=483,617 483w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=416,531 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=39,50 39w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Tian and Dugan</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Courtesy of Upside Robotics</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pair formally founded Upside Robotics in 2024 and then hit the fields — literally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We actually bought a camper trailer, and we moved around field to field,” Dugan said. “We stayed on the side of the field every night, and we would be walking, sometimes around the clock. We have spent every hour of the day in a corn field at some point in time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dugan built a robot in two weeks so they could start to test their idea. This device was a remote-controlled car that Dugan and Tian would operate manually. They’d follow the robot around the fields to collect data and demonstrate how the fertilizing system would work to farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We did our manual applications in year one, and that allowed us to iterate super fast, not just kind of on the hardware side, but learning by being with the farmers,” Tian said. “Some of our farmers said that we spent probably more time than they did in a lifetime in their fields. That allowed us to wrap up quickly. Neither of us were farmers, so that gave us firsthand experience into what it is like to basically be a farmer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After spending the 2024 season proving the company’s concept, they spent that off-season developing the fourth generation of their robot for the 2025 growing season. They went from 70 acres in 2024 to 1,200 acres in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company is gearing up to serve more than 3,000 acres in the upcoming 2026 season with 100% customer retention since the beginning. Upside reported that it has thus far helped its customers cut fertilizer use by 70%, which equates to around $150 in savings per acre per season.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upside recently raised a $7.5 million seed round led by Plural with participation from Garage Capital and the founders of <a href=\"https://clearpathrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Clearpath Robotics</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding will be used to continue to fund research and development and to keep up with demand — there are more than 200 farms on their waitlist. The company also hopes to expand out of Canada with a target of breaking into the U.S. corn belt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People always question if farmers are going to adopt new solutions, and they certainly are, and that’s something that we’ve learned firsthand, as long as you can provide them with a clear [return on investment] and a clear reason of why this technology was built,” Tian said. “In our case, it wasn’t something that we actually had to sell to farmers. In a lot of cases, our farmers actually asked for this solution.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok on Wednesday announced the launch of a new “Local Feed” in the U.S. version of the app, which displays content related to travel, news, events, shopping, and dining near the user’s current location. The feed’s arrival comes shortly after a change in TikTok’s terms of service under the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-finalizes-deal-to-create-new-us-entity-and-avoid-ban/\">new U.S. joint venture</a>, which said that the app would begin to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\">collect precise location information</a> from TikTok users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, TikTok confirms the reason it’s now asking for more accurate location information is to help power the Local Feed. However, it notes that users will be able to control whether or not precise location sharing is on, and the default will be set to “off,” making this an opt-in experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Local Feed had rolled out in December to select European markets, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/tiktok-rolls-out-a-nearby-feed-to-display-local-content-in-select-countries/\">including</a> the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company explains in its <a href=\"https://usdsjv.tiktok.com/Introducing-the-Local-Feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a> that the feed is meant to help users stay connected to their local community, and its posts are shown to people based on their location, the content’s topic, and when the content was posted. This makes it a more current feed of local information — like suggestions of new restaurants to try, local events, shopping suggestions, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature also ties into TikTok’s push to attract small businesses to its app, not only as content producers but as advertisers. This could help insulate it against further regulation and help it to claim, as Meta does, that it should not be reigned in because so many <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/04/hoping-to-stall-a-ban-tiktok-says-it-generated-14-7b-for-us-small-businesses-last-year/\">small businesses rely on its services</a> to reach their customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok notes that 7.5 million businesses currently use the app to reach global customers, and these businesses support more than 28 million workers, per a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/oxford-economics-us-jobs-impact-report?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2025 Oxford Economics report</a>.

The bottleneck was always the same — most project management tools like Atlassian’s Jira and Asana simply weren’t secure enough to meet the government’s strict security standards.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, in early 2022, Conafay launched <a href=\"https://integrate.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Integrate</a>, a collaboration platform designed specifically to allow private companies, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other government agencies to work jointly on classified, multi-entity projects. Last year, the Seattle-based startup won a <a href=\"https://integrate.co/blog/u-s-space-force-awards-25m-contract-to-integrate-for-program-execution-modernization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$25 million</a>, five-year contract from the U.S. Space Force.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That validation from a major agency was one of the reasons Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, just led Integrate’s $17 million Series A. Chan, known for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/02/wesley-chan-venture-capital-unicorn/\">early bets</a> on Canva, Robinhood, Plaid, and more than 20 other unicorns, told TechCrunch he invested because Integrate solves a big problem for the government and the private companies that serve it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until recently, the tech sector shunned selling to the U.S. Department of Defense, feeling that it was immoral to create products for the military. But that sentiment changed after Russia invaded Ukraine and China began to be viewed as an adversary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This shift also means other project management companies may now want to sell their products to the government, but Conafay claims it will be technically difficult for them to catch up to Integrate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you don’t build something from the ground up with government requirements, you can’t really go back and re-architect software that exists for government purposes,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Conafay, what sets Integrate apart from its civilian-focused competitors is its ability to let different organizations simultaneously and securely collaborate on massive project schedules while keeping sensitive details hidden from other participants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Integrate is designed to handle the coordination of mammoth, multi-year mega-projects, such as the F-35 Lightning II program or the James Webb Space Telescope, where thousands of partners must stay in sync, Conafay explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While he was careful not to reveal too much about customers besides the Space Force, he did say that some of the work the startup is doing for that branch of U.S. military involves deployments of large rockets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They have to coordinate tens of satellites on a single launch across dozens of missions,” Conafay said. “The complexity is pretty extreme, and they use us to coordinate those things.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Integrate intends to grow by selling its software to other branches of the U.S. military, including the Navy, the Army, and the intelligence community, as well as to the private companies that serve them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At parties, for example, she’s the one helping people with their phone privacy configurations. “It got to a point where I realized the best way to actually protect consumer data is to help secure the enterprises that hold the world’s data.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So she launched a company called <a href=\"https://www.complyance.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Complyance</a> to do just that. On Wednesday, the company announced a $20 million Series A led by GV. Complyance is an app that companies integrate into their existing tech stack. It uses AI agents to help them manage governance, risk, and, well, data compliance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AI basically automates a number of manual tasks,” Kaul said. “It uses AI to do custom checks on data coming in against their own specific criteria and risk thresholds.” The AI then flags any risks that need review. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These risk reviews can take weeks or months when done manually. It’s a standard audit-based process that happens perhaps once a year or once a quarter, where teams will run a check on their organization. Tools like Complyance hope to make this process more efficient by using technology to run continuous checks in seconds, so companies never have to wonder if they are in data compliance. It also has an agent that assesses the risk of any third-party vendors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re trying to redefine what enterprise GRC teams spend their time doing right now,” she said, adding that it’s usually chasing down mundane tasks. GRC refers to governance, risk, and compliance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in the market include Archer, ServiceNow GRC, and OneTrust. She said her company differs from incumbents because it is AI-native, rather than layering AI features on top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kaul declined to say how many customers the company has, but noted that it works with a few Fortune 500 companies. Complyance has raised $28 million in funding to date. Though the company came out of stealth in 2023, its first product didn’t go to market until the end of 2024. Kaul called fundraising “kind of a fairy tale,” because GV actually approached her.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’ve been looking for an enterprise-grade AI-led product in the space that was winning over enterprise clients, and we were doing that,” Kaul said. Others in this latest Series A round include Speedinvest, Everywhere Ventures, and angel investors from Anthropic and Mastercard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh capital will be used to help with go-to-market expansion, Kaul said. She wants to release 30 more purpose-built agents on top of the 16 the product already has. The goal is to help make the lives and work of GRCs much easier. After all, they didn’t sign up to chase down mundane tasks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They signed up to help protect their businesses and help protect their business customers,” she said. “By redefining some of those workflows and redefining how work gets done, we’re able to unblock them to help them focus on those strategic priorities.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now it has raised another $520 million from earlier investors Google, Mercedes-Benz, and B Capital, alongside some new investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it may sound like the startup is just selling off ever bigger chunks of itself at its Series A price, that’s not exactly what’s happening. The company says its investors have paid progressively more for shares in each subsequent extension — valuing it at roughly triple the initial Series A valuation of around $1.75 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why not just call this a Series B then? The company says it is still in early stages of development and was not actively seeking funding —  rather it was dealing with inbound interest, says a source close to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fair enough. Another $520 million in a year, especially at a higher valuation, would be hard to turn away, particularly for tech as expensive to build as bipedal robots. Closely watched competitor Figure AI, for instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">had raised nearly $2 billion total</a> since its 2022 founding before announcing a further $1 billion round last fall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the excitement over Apptronik is that it has <a href=\"https://apptronik.com/news-collection/apptronik-partners-with-google-deepmind-robotics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnered with Google DeepMind</a>, as well as GXO and Mercedes-Benz, to deliver what the industry calls embodied AI — robots capable of perceiving their environment and taking physical action based on reasoning, rather than just following fixed instructions. The robot is being built for tasks like unloading trailers, picking warehouse inventory, and tending machinery, the company says.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite retaining the early-stage funding label, Apptronik is no Johnny-come-lately to this field. As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/apptronik-raises-350m-to-build-humanoid-robots-with-help-from-google/\">we’ve previously reported</a>, its humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years before the company was formally founded.

A new company called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meridian.ai/\">Meridian</a> has emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken several hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was led by Andressen Horowitz and the General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Litquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Excel agents have been <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT0lDFDprIg\">a popular target for AI startups</a>, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agents <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shortcut.ai/\">like Shortcut AI</a> built agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Ling describes it, Meridian’s biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you go to ten different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you’ll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that’s totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, the Meridian team has done significant work to make their outputs more auditable and deterministic, while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-based tools. The result is a mixture of agentic AI and more conventional tooling, minimizing the hallucinations that slow down many enterprise deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to really remove the doubt layer right from the LLM process,” Ling says. “You know exactly how the logic flows, and all of these assumptions or whatever that go into the model, you can see exactly where they’re coming from.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company — specifically, how it relates to the moon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to The New York Times, which reports that it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/elon-musk-lunar-factory.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">heard the meeting</a>, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What Musk didn’t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">xAI-SpaceX </a>entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That brings the total to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/nearly-half-of-xais-founding-team-has-now-left-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company</a>. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/spacexs-ipo-could-open-the-floodgates-and-secondaries-are-booming-in-the-meantime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SpaceX IPO</a> reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020640004628742577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posting</a> that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something quite powerful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/who-gets-to-inherit-the-stars-a-space-ethicist-on-what-were-not-talking-about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last month</a>, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon <em>is</em> the moon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Fidji Simo, who serves as OpenAI’s CEO of Applications — a role overseeing the company’s consumer-facing products — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/842657/openai-chatgpt-adult-mode-debut-q1-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has told</a> reporters that the new feature is planned to launch during the first quarter of this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beiermeister and others at the company have raised concerns about how the new “adult” feature could potentially impact certain users, according to the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI reportedly said that Beiermeister, who was fired following a leave of absence, had “made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beiermeister’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbeiermeister/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn profile</a> says she previously worked for four years on Meta’s product team and spent more than seven years working for Palantir.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it <a href=\"https://x.com/jimmybajimmyba/status/2021374875793801447?s=12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">read in part</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of <a href=\"https://observer.com/2023/07/elon-musk-launches-xai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the company’s 12-person founding team</a> have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/elon-musks-xai-loses-co-founder-igor-babuschkin-for-venture-firm.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">left to found a venture firm</a>, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, <a href=\"https://x.com/TheGregYang/status/2013652609455006006\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">citing health issues</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bizarre behavior</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/17/groks-white-genocide-responses-show-gen-ai-tampered-with-at-will.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">apparent internal tampering</a> — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that <a href=\"https://counterhate.com/research/grok-floods-x-with-sexualized-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">flooded the platform with deepfake pornography</a>, sparking slow-moving but real <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/eu-investigates-musks-ai-chatbot-grok-over-sexual-deepfakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legal consequences</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/elon-musk-is-getting-serious-about-orbital-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spinning up plans for orbital data centers</a>, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-discusses-ai-content-marketplace-publishers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently <a href=\"https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/february-2026/building-toward-a-sustainable-content-economy-for-the-agentic-web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched</a> what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/all-the-media-companies-that-have-licensing-deals-with-openai-so-far\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">content-licensing partnerships</a> with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/judge-rejects-anthropics-record-breaking-15-billion-settlement-for-ai-copyright-lawsuit-033512498.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a monsoon of lawsuits</a>, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2026/02/senate-bill-ai-training-models-copyright-1236714135/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">are being proposed all the time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Media publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/ai-summaries-causing-devastating-drop-in-online-news-audiences-study-finds#:~:text=6%20months%20old-,AI%20summaries%20cause%20'devastating'%20drop%20in%20audiences%2C%20online%20news,delivered%20below%20an%20AI%20overview.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">One recent study</a> claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites.

But the sibling duo used AI music in their rhythm dance program, which doesn’t break any official rules, but serves as a depressing symbol of how absolutely cooked we are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Mrázek spun his sister in a crazy cartwheel-lift-sort-of-move that made them look superhuman, one of the NBC commentators mentioned in passing, “This is AI generated, this first part,” referring to the music. Somehow, that admission is even more baffling than the gravity-defying tricks that the siblings showed off on the pressure of Olympic ice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Olympic ice dance competition is split into two events: the rhythm dance, where pairs must perform a routine that meets a specific theme, and the free dance. This season’s theme is “The Music, Dance Styles, and Feeling of the 1990s.” British ice dancing duo Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson paid tribute to the Spice Girls, while United States favorites Madison Chock and Evan Bates skated to a Lenny Kravitz medley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, for whatever reason — licensing issues? — Mrázková and Mrázek danced to a routine with music that’s half AC/DC and half AI. It’s weird. What’s even weirder is that this isn’t the duo’s first use of AI, nor is it the first time that this choice backfired.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the International Skating Union, the governing body that oversees competitive ice skating, the <a href=\"https://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00110767.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">duo’s music choice</a> for the rhythm dance this season has been “One Two by AI (of 90s style Bon Jovi)” and “Thunderstruck by AC/DC.” The official Olympics website <a href=\"https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/fsk/id/x/icedance----------/qual/000100--/result\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirms</a> that the duo is using the AI-generated song for the rhythm dance portion.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Czech siblings have faced backlash before for using AI-generated music. Earlier in the season, they played a ’90s-inspired song for their routine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvKOjFqyDQE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">that began with</a> a wailing declaration: “Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz!” If that sounds familiar, it’s because that lyric comes directly from the ’90s hit “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals (which, by the way, has an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL7-CKirWZE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">incredible music video</a> shot in a Staten Island mall — the true essence of American suburbia!).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI-generated lyrics also include the lines, “Wake up, kids/We got the dreamer’s disease,” and “First we run, and then we laugh ’til we cry.” What a coincidence! Those lyrics also appear in the song “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals. The AI song is even titled “One Two,” which are the first words of… you can probably guess which song at this point.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before the Olympics, the duo changed the song, swapping out the New Radicals lyrics for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsfRhm0CcXM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other AI-generated lyrics</a> that sound suspiciously like Bon Jovi lyrics, as journalist Shana Bartels <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/follow-up-and-ai-143894585\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">noted in November</a>. For example, “raise your hands, set the night on fire” also appear in “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLD1rWuH1JA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Raise Your Hands</a>” by Bon Jovi… and the AI “vocalist” sounds a lot like Bon Jovi, too. (Not to pour salt on the wound, but “Raise Your Hands” isn’t even from the ’90s!) This was the music that the duo danced to on Monday at the Olympics, before it transitioned into “Thunderstruck” by AC/DC, a real song from the ’90s written by real people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s unclear what software the team used to generate this music, this is an LLM operating as it’s supposed to. These LLMs are trained on large libraries of music, often through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3b-over-flagrant-piracy-of-20000-works/\">legally dubious</a> means. When prompted, LLMs produce the most statistically probable response to an input. That’s useful when writing code, but means a song “in the style of Bon Jovi,” will likely end up using some actual Bon Jovi lyrics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And yet, the music industry seems at least temporarily enamored with the idea of “musicians” who aren’t totally real. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to set her (hopefully real) poetry to music under the persona Xania Monet. Now she has a <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3 million record deal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a shame that these Czech dancers’ accomplishment of skating at the Olympics may be marred by discourse around their use of AI music (discourse that I am actively contributing to). But come on! Isn’t this sport supposed to be creative? </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Amanda McMaster, the company’s chief financial officer, will stand in for the top job while the company looks for a replacement.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boston Dynamics sent TechCrunch the following statement, “Robert Playter is an icon of the global robotics industry, and the entire Boston Dynamics team wishes to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude for his leadership. From the earliest days of hopping robots, to the world’s first quadrupeds, to spearheading the entire humanoid industry, Playter made his mark as a pioneer of innovation. He transformed Boston Dynamics from a small research and development lab into a successful business that now proudly calls itself the global leader in mobile robotics. He will be sorely missed, but we hope he enjoys some well-deserved time off. Thanks Rob.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Playter took the helm at Boston Dynamics in 2020, taking over from founder Marc Raibert. Playter worked at Boston Dynamics for 30 years, where he held other roles, including vice president of engineering and chief operating officer.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 by Raibert as a spinoff from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a professor. Google’s parent company Alphabet bought Boston Dynamics in 2013, before the company was sold to Japanese investing conglomerate SoftBank in 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai, its current owner, acquired the company in 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The robotics producer is best known for its quadruped robot, Spot, which the company commercialized in 2020 shortly after Playter took the helm. The company most recently announced Atlas, a humanoid robot.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece has been updated to include commentary from Boston Dynamics. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
