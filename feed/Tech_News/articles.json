They can then use text or voice to enter the prompt of their choice, such as “raging death metal,” “sad post rock,” “progressive house mix for a chill party,” “indie pop” or “90s classic hits,” to build a playlist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube has been toying around with using AI to create playlists for a while. In July 2024, the company was testing a feature to let people create <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/youtube-music-is-testing-an-ai-generated-radio-feature-and-adding-a-song-recognition-tool/\">custom radio stations using prompts</a> in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other rival streaming services like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/07/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists-you-can-build-using-prompts/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/amazon-music-follows-spotify-with-an-ai-playlist-generator-of-its-own-maestro/\">Amazon Music</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/deezer-chases-spotify-and-amazon-music-with-its-own-ai-playlist-generator/\">Deezer</a>, have also rolled out AI-powered playlist or radio creation features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube has been trying to make its Premium plan more attractive to users. Earlier this week, the company started restricting <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5google.com/2026/02/07/youtube-music-lyrics-premium/\">free users from viewing song lyrics</a> on the YouTube Music app. The company told TechCrunch that the restriction was an experiment it was running “with a small percentage of ad-supported users,” and that song lyrics are available to the vast majority of free users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has seen an uptick in its subscription business, and YouTube is a key part of that division. Earlier this month, the company said it now has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/googles-subscriptions-rise-in-q4-as-youtube-pulls-60b-in-yearly-revenue/\">325 million paying users across Google One and YouTube Premium</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

It’s that AI will save you from it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the version the industry has spent the last three years selling to millions of nervous people who are eager to buy it. Yes, some white-collar jobs will disappear. But for most other roles, the argument goes, AI is a force multiplier. You become a more capable, more indispensable lawyer, consultant, writer, coder, financial analyst — and so on. The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it\">new study</a> published in Harvard Business Review follows that premise to its actual conclusion, and what it finds there isn’t a productivity revolution. It finds companies are at risk of becoming burnout machines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of what they describe as “in-progress research,” UC Berkeley researchers spent eight months inside a 200-person tech company watching what happened when workers genuinely embraced AI. What they found across more than 40 “in-depth” interviews was that nobody was pressured at this company. Nobody was told to hit new targets. People just started doing more because the tools made more feel doable. But because they could do these things, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees’ to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As one engineer told them, “You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less. But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over on the tech industry forum Hacker News, one commenter had the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945755\">same reaction</a>, writing, “I feel this. Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s fascinating and also alarming. The argument about AI and work has always stalled on the same question — are the gains real? But too few have stopped to ask what happens when they are.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers’ new findings aren’t entirely novel. A separate trial last summer found experienced developers using AI tools took <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/\">19% longer on tasks</a> while believing they were 20% faster. Around the same time, a National Bureau of Economic Research study tracking AI adoption across thousands of workplaces found that productivity gains amounted to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w33777\">just 3% in time savings</a>, with no significant impact on earnings or hours worked in any occupation. Both studies have gotten picked apart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This one may be harder to dismiss because it doesn’t challenge the premise that AI can augment what employees can do on their own. It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry bet that helping people do more would be the answer to everything, but it may turn out to be the beginning of a different problem entirely. The research is worth reading, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company has signed up more than 2,600 business customers throughout the U.K. on the promise that buying energy from its utility division can save them up to 30% on their energy bills.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup recently closed an oversubscribed $75 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from AlbionVC, Allianz, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Revent, Schroders Capital, and Voyager Ventures, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round values Tem at more than $300 million, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. The startup plans to use the funding to help expand to Australia and the U.S., starting with Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in a nice position where we kind of have control over our own profitability. So I could have chosen not to raise at all and had a lovely, nice bootstrap business in some ways,” Joe McDonald, co-founder and CEO of Tem, told TechCrunch. “Well, we’re not that kind of business. We know what we want to achieve as someone who wants to go public over the years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tem is a classic marketplace play, matching electricity generators with consumers. The company intentionally started by focusing almost exclusively on renewable energy generators and small businesses to fill both sides of the ledger. “The more decentralized and the more distributed, the better it is for the algorithms,” McDonald said. “But this works all the way up to enterprise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s customers include fast-fashion retailer Boohoo Group, soft drink company Fever-Tree, and Newcastle United FC. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Tem is running what amounts to two different businesses. One, called Rosso, is the transaction engine that matches suppliers with buyers. Here, machine learning algorithms and LLMs help predict supply and demand. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal with Rosso, McDonald said, is to cut costs by eliminating several layers that are present in current energy markets. “In each of them, you’ve got different teams doing different jobs, taking different levels of profit from back office to trading, trading desks to other trading desks, and probably five to six intermediaries in total that enable the flow of money to move from one side to the other,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With AI, he said, “you now have an opportunity to replace the humans, the labor costs, and the disparate systems into one single transaction infrastructure.” The goal is to make the price that customers pay for electricity closer to the wholesale cost.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other part of Tem, called RED, is a “neo-utility” built to prove the value of Rosso. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we first started, we tried to sell our infrastructure to the energy companies, and we got nowhere,” he said. RED is currently the only utility using Rosso, and McDonald said its growth has pushed the company to prioritize it over opening Rosso to others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At some point, though, Tem plans to allow other utilities in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In reality, it doesn’t matter how good [RED] is; it’s not going to get above a 40% market share. And it shouldn’t, because that becomes a monopoly in itself. So, me, I’d much rather go to get access to all the transaction flow,” McDonald said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Long term, we really don’t mind who owns the customer, who owns the generation as long as our infrastructure is being used,” he said. “This is just an infrastructure play in the same way AWS was, or Stripe was.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Ahmedabad City Crime Branch has become the first police unit in India to integrate Aadhaar-based offline verification with PATHIK, a guest-monitoring platform launched by the police department, aimed at hotels and guest accommodations to record visitors’ information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UIDAI has also positioned the new Aadhaar app as a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/UIDAI/status/2019757027191582882\">digital visiting card</a> for meetings and networking, allowing users to share selected personal details via a QR code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Officials at the launch in New Delhi said these latest efforts are part of a broader effort to replace photocopies and manual ID checks with consent-based, offline verification. The approach, they argued, is meant to give users more control over which specific identity information they want to share, while enabling verification at scale without having to query Aadhaar’s central database.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-early-uptake-on-top-of-massive-scale\">Early uptake on top of massive scale</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While UIDAI formally launched the new Aadhaar app last month, it had been in testing since earlier in 2025. Estimates from Appfigures show that the app, which appeared in app stores toward the end of 2025, quickly overtook the older mAadhaar app in monthly downloads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Combined monthly installs of Aadhaar-related apps rose from close to 2 million in October to nearly 9 million in December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new app is being layered onto an identity system that already operates at enormous scale considering India’s population. Figures published on<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uidai.gov.in/aadhaar_dashboard/\"> UIDAI’s public dashboard</a> show that Aadhaar has issued more than 1.4 billion identity numbers and handles roughly 2.5 billion authentication transactions each month, alongside tens of billions of electronic “know your customer” checks since its launch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift toward offline verification does not replace this infrastructure so much as extending it, moving Aadhaar from a largely backend verification tool into a more visible and everyday interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the app’s launch, UIDAI officials said the move toward offline verification was intended to address long-standing risks <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/28/india-rajasthan-government-jan-aadhaar-bug-fix/\">associated with physical photocopies and screenshots of Aadhaar documents</a>, which have often been collected, stored, and circulated with little oversight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion comes at a time of regulatory changes, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/india-expands-aadhaar-authentication-for-businesses-raising-privacy-concerns/\">easing restrictions</a>, and a<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uidai.gov.in/images/OVSE_Playbook.pdf\"> new framework</a> (PDF), with UIDAI now allowing some public and private organizations to verify Aadhaar credentials without querying the central database. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consent-accountability-and-unresolved-risks\">Consent, accountability, and unresolved risks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Civil liberties and digital rights groups say those legal changes do not resolve Aadhaar’s deeper structural risks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raman Jit Singh Chima, senior international counsel and Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, said the expansion of Aadhaar into offline and private-sector settings introduces new threats, particularly at a time when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/india-digital-data-privacy-bill/\">India’s data protection framework</a> is still being put in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chima questioned the timing of the rollout, arguing that the federal government should have waited for India’s Data Protection Board to be established first, and allow for independent review and wider consultation with affected communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fact that this has gone ahead at this point of time seems to indicate a preference to continue the expansion of the use of Aadhaar, even if it is unclear in terms of the further risks that it might pose to the system, as well as to the data of Indians,” Chima told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indian legal advocacy groups also point to unresolved implementation failures. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prasanth Sugathan, legal director at New Delhi-based digital rights group SFLC.in, said that while UIDAI has framed the app as a tool for citizen empowerment, it does little to address persistent problems, such as inaccuracies in the Aadhaar database, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/security-bug-in-indias-income-tax-portal-exposed-taxpayers-sensitive-data/\">security lapses</a>, and poor mechanisms for redress, which have disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also cited a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cag-report-uidai-audit-aadhaar-data-7857808/\">2022 report</a> by India’s Comptroller and Auditor General, which found UIDAI had failed to meet certain compliance standards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Such issues can often result in disenfranchisement of people, especially those who were meant to be benefited by such systems,” Sugathan told TechCrunch, adding that it remains unclear how data shared through the new app would prevent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/13/aadhaar-leak-pm-kisan/\">breaches or leaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Campaigners associated with Rethink Aadhaar, a civil society campaign focused on Aadhaar-related rights and accountability, argue that the offline verification system risks reintroducing private-sector use of Aadhaar in ways the Supreme Court has already explicitly barred. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shruti Narayan and John Simte of the group said enabling private entities to routinely rely on Aadhaar for verification amounts to “Aadhaar creep”, normalizing its use across social and economic life despite a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sflc.in/key-highlights-aadhaar-judgment/\">2018 judgment</a> that struck down provisions allowing private actors to use Aadhaar to verify people’s information. They warned that consent in such contexts is often illusory, particularly in situations involving hotels, housing societies, or delivery workers, while India’s data protection law <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/india-data-law-surveillance-privacy-big-tech-data-protection-press-freedom/a-74923737\">remains largely untested</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Together, the new app, regulatory changes, and expanding ecosystem are shifting Aadhaar from a background identity utility into a visible layer of daily life that is increasingly hard to avoid. As India doubles down on Aadhaar, governments and tech companies are watching closely, attracted by the promise of population-scale identity checks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian IT ministry and UIDAI CEO did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It also has driverless test fleets in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company tends to follow the same rollout strategy in every new market, starting with a small fleet of vehicles that are manually driven to map the city. The autonomous vehicles are then tested with a human safety operator in the driver’s seat. Eventually, the company conducts driverless testing, often allowing employees to hail rides, before launching a robotaxi service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The company has attracted celebrity investors like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/11/step-crypto-kids-debt-financing-digital-banking-fintech/\">Charli D’Amelio</a>, Will Smith, The Chainsmokers, and Stephen Curry, in addition to venture firms like General Catalyst, Coatue, and the payments company Stripe.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the company wants to continue getting its fintech product in front of young eyes, then partnering with Gen Z phenom MrBeast is wise. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is the most-subscribed creator on YouTube, with over 466 million subscribers, but his ambitions stretch beyond his over-the-top videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,” the 27-year-old <a href=\"https://x.com/MrBeast/status/2020910218360782929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a>. “I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This acquisition makes sense, considering that a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/mrbeast-reportedly-plans-to-launch-a-phone-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">leaked pitch document</a> from last year showed this was an area of interest for Beast Industries. The company is also reportedly interested in launching a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), a lower-cost cell phone plan similar to Ryan Reynolds’ Mint Mobile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In line with other top creators, Beast Industries’ business is much more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/youtubers-arent-relying-on-ad-revenue-anymore-heres-how-some-are-diversifying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube ad revenue</a>.

What’s going to happen to all these companies? What’s AI going to do with all these companies?’ For us, it’s just increasing the usage,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be sure, he also wants to distance Databricks from the SaaS label, given that private markets value it as an AI company. Databricks on Monday also officially closed on its massive, previously announced $5 billion raise <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/databricks-raises-4b-at-134b-valuation-as-its-ai-business-heats-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">at a $134 billion valuation</a>, and nabbed a $2 billion loan facility as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the company is straddling both worlds. Databricks is still best known as a cloud data warehouse provider. A data warehouse is where enterprises store massive amounts of data to analyze for business insights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ghodsi called out, in particular, one AI product that’s driving usage of its data warehouse: its LLM user interface named Genie.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie is an example of how a SaaS business can <a href=\"https://x.com/buccocapital/status/2019598551228223526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">replace its user interface</a> with natural language. For instance, he uses it to ask why warehouse usage and revenue spike on particular days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just a few years ago, such a request required writing queries in a specific technical language, or having a special report programmed. Today, any product with an LLM interface can be used by anyone, Ghodsi noted. Genie is one reason for the company’s usage growth numbers, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The threat of AI to SaaS isn’t, as <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2019494196953154011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one AI VC jokingly tweeted</a>, that enterprises will rip out their SaaS “systems of record” to replace them with vibe-coded homegrown versions. Systems of record store critical business data, whether it’s on sales, customer support, or finance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Why would you move your system of record? You know, it’s hard to move it,” Ghodsi said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model makers aren’t offering databases to store that data and become systems of record anyway. Instead, they hope to replace the user interface with natural language for human use, or APIs or other plug-ins for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So the threat to SaaS businesses, Ghodsi says, is that people no longer spend their careers becoming masters of a particular product: Salesforce specialists, or ServiceNow, or SAP. Once the interface is just language, the products become invisible, like plumbing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Millions of people around the world got trained on those user interfaces. And so that was the biggest moat that those businesses have,” Ghodsi warned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SaaS companies that embrace the new LLM interface could grow, as Databricks is doing. But it also opens up possibilities for AI-native competitors to offer alternatives that work better with AI and agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Databricks created its Lakebase database designed for agents. He’s seeing early traction. “In its eight months that we’ve had it in the market, it’s done twice as much revenue as our data warehouse had when it was eight months old. Okay, obviously, that’s like comparing toddlers,” Ghodsi says. “But this is a toddler that’s twice as big.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, now that Databricks has closed on its massive funding round, Ghodsi tells us that the company is not immediately working on another raise, nor prepping for an IPO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now is not a great time to go public,” Ghodsi said. “I just wanted to be really well capitalized” should the markets go “south” again as they did in the 2022 downturn, when interest rates rose sharply after years of near-zero rates. A thick bank account “protects us, gives us many, many years of runway,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This was portrayed on-screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/sam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sam Altman got extremely testy</a> about the jabs, <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019139174339928189%7Ctwgr%5Ef7936706cec58630b15e0db69484ae55fcea10e0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fsam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">calling</a> the ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/openai-slammed-for-app-suggestions-that-looked-like-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">backlash late last year</a> when it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT’s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on “what’s most helpful to you.” The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In tests, OpenAI has tried matching ads to users based on the subject of their conversations, past chats, and previous ad interactions. For instance, users researching recipes might see ads for grocery delivery services or meal kits, the company says. OpenAI said advertisers won’t have access to user data, only aggregate information about ad performance, like views and clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users will also be able to view their history of interactions with ads and clear it at any time. Plus, OpenAI said users can dismiss ads, share feedback, view why they were shown an ad, and manage ad personalization settings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ads won’t be shown to users under 18, nor will they be placed near sensitive or regulated topics like health, politics, or mental health. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/luminar-sale-approved-despite-last-minute-mystery-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for $33 million</a>. Ouster itself has played the M&amp;A game a fair amount, too. In 2022, the company merged with rival player Velodyne. The year before that, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/ouster-and-velodyne-agree-to-merger-signaling-consolidation-in-lidar-industry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bought lidar startup Sense Photonics</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This consolidation is happening right as companies and investors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/techcrunch-mobility-physical-ai-enters-the-hype-machine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rush to build businesses</a> around “physical AI” — a broad term that encompasses everything from humanoid robotics and drones to self-driving cars and automated systems in warehouses. Even more obscure suppliers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/ethernovia-raises-90m-as-investors-rush-to-fund-physical-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raising big funding rounds</a> as these technologies develop. Some startups are even trying to spin up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/teradar-exits-stealth-with-an-all-weather-sensor-for-autonomy-and-150m-in-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entirely new sensor modalities</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ouster co-founder and CEO Angus Pacala told TechCrunch in an interview that he had been eyeing StereoLabs for years. He said he sees lidar as “the core component of safety-critical, capable systems,” but that he wanted to “move up the stack.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “obvious additional sensors” to start working with in addition to lidar, Pacala said, are cameras. Pacala said 15-year-old StereoLabs is “best in class” on the hardware side, but he was especially drawn to how the company has been getting the most out of those cameras by being “incredibly savvy in adopting the cutting edge of AI models and edge compute.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In particular, Pacala highlighted StereoLabs’ development of a foundational AI model that can determine depth of objects from stereo cameras. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was a no-brainer for us to go out and approach them and basically pitch this vision of working with us to become a unified sensing and perception platform — a tier one [supplier] for these advanced physical AI systems,” Pacala said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the focus on integration, Ouster said StereoLabs will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while the hype has been feverish, Pacala said he didn’t buy StereoLabs simply because of the attention and money being thrown at physical AI. In fact, he committed maybe the gravest sin one can during a hype cycle: he poured some cold water on the buzz, especially around humanoid robotics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The business model here is not to just sell the fervor, it’s to actually make working systems that are certified, that are safe, that are really solving customer problems,” he said. “There’s going to be a little bit of disillusionment in physical AI as it turns out that it’s much longer time to market for all these humanoids.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pacala isn’t the only one trying to take a realistic view. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said the sensor industry is “ripe for consolidation” because he believes there isn’t enough revenue to support all the current competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re going to get consolidation, or you’re going to get kind of a weeding out of the industry as people fall to the wayside,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Only a parent or guardian can create a teen account, according to Lyft. Drivers who are matched with these underage passengers must meet additional criteria and pass yearly background checks. Teens can also bring guests along for the ride, as long as the parent has given permission, according to Lyft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft has also baked in features like PIN verification, audio recording, and real-time tracking to allow parents to see where their teen is during their ride. Parents who want to sign up their teen can go to the app, select their profile at the bottom right of the screen, then tap “Lyft Teen.” From here, parents can enter the teen’s contact info and add a shared payment method to cover teen rides. Once confirmed, the teen will receive a text message with a unique sign-up link.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft is playing catch-up with Uber and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/teenagers-can-now-hail-a-waymo-robotaxi-in-phoenix/\">even Waymo</a>, which offers teen accounts in its robotaxi service area in Phoenix. Uber tested teen accounts as early as 2017 but didn’t roll out a commercial product until spring 2024 in more than a dozen cities in the U.S. and Canada. Uber has since added numerous other U.S. markets, as well as dozens of other countries. Last year, Uber started testing out teen accounts in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/03/uber-is-piloting-accounts-for-teenagers-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">several cities in India</a>, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft’s new teen account is one of numerous new products and expansions that Risher has introduced at the company since he took the CEO spot. Lyft has made a handful of autonomous vehicle partnerships, including with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/lyft-partners-with-may-mobility-mobileye-to-bring-autonomous-vehicles-to-the-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">May Mobility</a>, Austrian manufacturer Benteler, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/lyft-to-add-autonomous-shuttles-in-2026-as-uber-inks-more-self-driving-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Holon</a>, Tensor Auto, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/lyft-partners-with-may-mobility-mobileye-to-bring-autonomous-vehicles-to-the-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">autonomy provider Mobileye</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also pushed into Europe with its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/lyft-to-buy-taxi-app-freenow-for-197m-to-enter-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$197 million acquisition </a>of German multi-mobility app Freenow from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility.

Multiple app makers promote and advertise their software — often referred to as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#stalkerware\">stalkerware</a> — to jealous partners who can use these apps to access their victims’ phones remotely.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet, despite how sensitive this personal data is, an increasing number of these companies are losing huge amounts of it.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to TechCrunch’s ongoing tally, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/hacktivist-scrapes-over-500000-stalkerware-customers-payment-records/\">most recent data spill involving uMobix</a>, there have been at least 27 stalkerware companies since 2017 that are known to have been hacked or leaked customer and victims’ data online. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not a typo. Dozens of stalkerware companies have either been hacked or had a significant data exposure in recent years. And at least four stalkerware companies were hacked multiple times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The makers of uMobix and associated mobile tracking apps, like Geofinder and Peekviewer, are the latest stalkerware providers to expose sensitive customer data, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/hacktivist-scrapes-over-500000-stalkerware-customers-payment-records/\">after a hacktivist scraped the payment information of more than 500,000 customers</a> and published them online. The hacktivist said they did this as a way to go after stalkerware apps, following in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/hackers-why-they-hit-stalkerware-flexispy-retina-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">two groups of hacktivists</a> that broke into Retina-X and FlexiSpy almost a decade ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The uMobix data leak comes after last year’s breach of Catwatchful, which was used to compromise the phone data of at least 26,000 victims. Catwatchful was just one of several stalkerware incidents in 2025, which included <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/data-breach-at-stalkerware-spyx-affects-close-to-2-million-including-thousands-of-apple-users/\">SpyX</a>, and the data exposures of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/stalkerware-apps-cocospy-spyic-exposing-phone-data-of-millions-of-people/\">Cocospy, Spyic</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/spyzie-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-of-android-and-iphone-users/\">Spyzie</a> surveillance operations, which left messages, photos, call logs, and other personal and sensitive data of millions of victims exposed online, according to a security researcher who found a bug that allowed them to access that data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to 2025, there were at least four massive stalkerware hacks in 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The last stalkerware breach in 2024 affected <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/25/spytech-data-breach-windows-mac-android-chromebook-spyware/\">Spytech, a little-known spyware maker based in Minnesota</a>, which exposed activity logs from the phones, tablets, and computers monitored with its spyware. Before that, there was a breach at mSpy, one of the longest-running stalkerware apps, which exposed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/11/mspy-spyware-millions-customers-data-breach/\">millions of customer support tickets</a>, which included the personal data of millions of its customers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, an unknown hacker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/25/spyware-app-pctattletale-was-hacked-and-its-website-defaced/\">broke into the servers of the U.S.-based stalkerware maker pcTattletale</a>. The hacker then stole and leaked the company’s internal data. They also defaced pcTattletale’s official website with the goal of embarrassing the company. The hacker referred to a recent TechCrunch article where we reported <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/22/spyware-found-on-hotel-check-in-computers/\">pcTattletale was used to monitor several front desk check-in computers</a> at a U.S. hotel chain.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of this hack, leak, and shame operation, pcTattletale founder Bryan Fleming <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/pctattletale-spyware-shutters-data-breach/\">said he was shutting down</a> his company. Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/founder-of-spyware-maker-pctattletale-pleads-guilty-to-hacking-and-advertising-surveillance-software/\">Fleming pled guilty</a> to charges of computer hacking, the sale and advertising of surveillance software for unlawful uses, and conspiracy. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consumer spyware apps like uMobix, Catwatchful, SpyX, Cocospy, mSpy, and pcTattletale are commonly referred to as “stalkerware” (or spouseware) because jealous spouses and partners use them to surreptitiously monitor and surveil their loved ones.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies often explicitly market their products as solutions to catch cheating partners by encouraging illegal and unethical behavior. There have been <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/30/emma-cline-countersues-after-ex-claims-she-used-spyware-to-plagiarise-his-work\">multiple court cases</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/stalkerware/\">media investigations</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/09/15/346149979/smartphones-are-used-to-stalk-control-domestic-abuse-victims\">surveys of domestic abuse shelters</a> that show that online stalking and monitoring can lead to cases of real-world harm and violence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s in part why hackers have repeatedly targeted some of these companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a leading researcher and activist who has investigated and fought stalkerware for years, said the stalkerware industry is a “soft target.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The people who run these companies are perhaps not the most scrupulous or really concerned about the quality of their product,” Galperin told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the history of stalkerware compromises, that may be an understatement. And because of the lack of care for protecting their own customers — and consequently the personal data of tens of thousands of unwitting victims — using these apps is doubly irresponsible. The stalkerware customers may be breaking the law, abusing their partners by illegally spying on them, and, on top of that, putting everyone’s data in danger. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A history of stalkerware hacks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flurry of stalkerware breaches began in 2017 when a group of hackers <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/53vm7n/inside-stalkerware-surveillance-market-flexispy-retina-x\">breached the U.S.-based Retina-X</a> and the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/aemeae/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers\">Thailand-based FlexiSpy</a> back to back. Those two hacks revealed that the companies had a total number of 130,000 customers all over the world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, the hackers who — proudly — claimed responsibility for the compromises explicitly said their motivations were to expose and hopefully help destroy an industry that they consider toxic and unethical. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m going to burn them to the ground, and leave absolutely nowhere for any of them to hide,” one of the hackers involved then told Motherboard.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Referring to FlexiSpy, the hacker added: “I hope they’ll fall apart and fail as a company, and have some time to reflect on what they did. However, I fear they might try and give birth to themselves again in a new form. But if they do, I’ll be there.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the hack, and years of negative public attention, FlexiSpy is still active today. The same cannot be said about Retina-X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacker who broke into Retina-X wiped its servers with the goal of hampering its operations. The company bounced back — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/3k7a5k/hacker-wipes-spyware-retina-x-flexispy\">and then it got hacked again a year later</a>. A couple of weeks after the second breach, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/neqgn8/retina-x-spyware-shuts-down-apps\">Retina-X announced that it was shutting down</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just days after the second Retina-X breach, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/7x77ex/hacker-strikes-stalkerware-companies-stealing-alleged-texts-and-gps-locations-of-customers\">hackers hit Mobistealth and Spy Master Pro</a>, stealing gigabytes of customer and business records, as well as victims’ intercepted messages and precise GPS locations. Another stalkerware vendor, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvm44m/hacker-steals-text-messages-android-spyware-company-spyhuman\">the India-based SpyHuman</a>, encountered the same fate a few months later, with hackers stealing text messages and call metadata, which contained logs of who called who and when.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weeks later, there was the first case of accidental data exposure, rather than a hack.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kmj4v/spyware-company-spyfone-terabytes-data-exposed-online-leak\">SpyFone left an Amazon-hosted S3 storage bucket unprotected online</a>, which meant anyone could view and download text messages, photos, audio recordings, contacts, location data, scrambled passwords and login information, Facebook messages, and more. All that data was stolen from victims, most of whom did not know they were being spied on, let alone know their most sensitive personal data was also on the internet for all to see.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apart from uMobix, other stalkerware companies that over the years have irresponsibly left customer and victims’ data online include: FamilyOrbit, which left 281 gigabytes of personal data online <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywk8gy/spyware-family-orbit-children-photos-data-breach\">protected only by an easy-to-find password</a>; mSpy, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/mobile-spyware-maker-leaks-2-million-records/\">which leaked over 2 million customer records</a> in 2018; Xnore, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pa97g7/xnore-copy9-stalkerware-data-breach-thousands-victims\">let any of its customers see the personal data of other customers’ targets</a>, including chat messages, GPS coordinates, emails, photos, and more; and MobiiSpy, which left 25,000 audio recordings and 95,000 images <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j573k3/spyware-data-leak-pictures-audio-recordings\">on a server accessible to anyone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The list goes on: KidsGuard in 2020 had a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/\">misconfigured server that leaked victims’ content</a>; pcTattletale, which prior to its 2024 hack also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezj8/stalkerware-leaking-phone-screenshots-pctattletale\">exposed screenshots of victims’ devices uploaded in real-time</a> to a website that anyone could access; and Xnspy, whose developers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/12/xnspy-stalkerware-iphone-android/\">left credentials and private keys left in the apps’ code</a>, allowing anyone to access victims’ data; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/spyzie-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-of-android-and-iphone-users/\">Spyzie</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/stalkerware-apps-cocospy-spyic-exposing-phone-data-of-millions-of-people/\">Cocospy and Spyic</a>, which left victims’ messages, photos, call logs, and other personal data, as well as customers’ email addresses, exposed online; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/data-breach-reveals-catwatchful-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-android-phones/\">Catwatchful</a>, which exposed the full database of email addresses and plaintext passwords of customers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As far as other stalkerware companies that actually got hacked, apart from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/data-breach-at-stalkerware-spyx-affects-close-to-2-million-including-thousands-of-apple-users/\">SpyX earlier in 2025</a>, there was Copy9, which saw <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pa97g7/xnore-copy9-stalkerware-data-breach-thousands-victims\">a hacker steal the data of all its surveillance targets</a>, including text messages and WhatsApp messages, call recordings, photos, contacts, and brows history; LetMeSpy, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/letmespy-spyware-shuts-down-wiped-server/\">which shut down after hackers breached and wiped its servers</a>; and the Brazil-based WebDetetive, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/26/brazil-webdetetive-spyware-deleted/\">which also got its servers deleted</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/fuckstalkerware-5/\">then hacked again</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There was also OwnSpy, which provides much of the back-end software for WebDetetive, which was hacked; Spyhide, which had a vulnerability in its code <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/spyhide-stalkerware-android/\">that allowed a hacker to access the back-end databases</a> and years of stolen around 60,000 victims’ data; Oospy, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/spyhide-oospy-hacked-phone-spyware-shuts-down/\">which was a rebrand of Spyhide,</a> shut down for a second tim; and mSpy again.Finally there is TheTruthSpy, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/thetruthspy-stalkerware-forged-passports-millions/\">network of stalkerware apps</a>, which holds the dubious record of having been hacked or having leaked data on at least <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/stalkerware-security-phone-data-thousands/\">three</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/new-thetruthspy-stalkerware-victims-is-your-android-device-compromised/\">separate</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/thetruthspy-investigation/\">occasions</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-hacked-but-unrepented\"><strong>Hacked, but unrepented</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of these 27 stalkerware companies, eight have shut down, according to TechCrunch’s tally.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a first and so far unique case, the Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/\">banned SpyFone and its chief executive, Scott Zuckerman</a>, from operating in the surveillance industry following an earlier security lapse that exposed victims’ data. Another linked operation called SpyTrac <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/17/support-king-ftc-spytrac/\">shut down</a> following a TechCrunch investigation. Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/ftc-upholds-ban-on-stalkerware-founder-scott-zuckerman/\">the FTC upheld its ban</a> on Zuckerman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhoneSpector and Highster, two stalkerware apps that are not known to have been hacked, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/02/phonespector-highster-stalkerware-shut-down/\">also shut down</a> after New York’s attorney general accused the companies of explicitly encouraging customers to use their software for illegal surveillance.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a company closing doesn’t mean it’s gone forever. As with Spyhide and SpyFone, some of the same owners and developers behind a shuttered stalkerware maker simply rebranded.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I do think that these hacks do things. They do accomplish things, they do put a dent in it,” Galperin said. “But if you think that if you hack a stalkerware company, that they will simply shake their fists, curse your name, disappear in a puff of blue smoke and never be seen again, that has most definitely not been the case.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What happens most often, when you actually manage to kill a stalkerware company, is that the stalkerware company comes up like mushrooms after the rain,” Galperin added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is some good news. In a report in 2023, security firm Malwarebytes said that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/stalkerware-activity-drops-but-glaring-problem-with-spying-revealed\">the use of stalkerware is declining</a>, according to its own data of customers infected with this type of software. Also, Galperin reports seeing an increase in negative reviews of these apps, with customers or prospective customers complaining they don’t work as intended. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, Galperin said that it’s possible that security firms are not as good at detecting stalkerware as they used to be, or stalkers have moved from software-based surveillance to physical surveillance enabled by AirTags and other Bluetooth-enabled trackers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Stalkerware does not exist in a vacuum. Stalkerware is part of a whole world of tech-enabled abuse,” Galperin said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Say no to stalkerware</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using spyware to monitor your loved ones is not only unethical, it’s also illegal in most jurisdictions, as it’s considered unlawful surveillance.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That is already a significant reason not to use stalkerware. Then there is the issue that stalkerware makers have proven time and time again that they cannot keep data secure — neither data belonging to the customers nor their victims or targets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apart from spying on romantic partners and spouses, some people use stalkerware apps to monitor their children. While this type of use, at least in the United States, is legal, it doesn’t mean using stalkerware to snoop on your kids’ phone isn’t creepy and unethical.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if it’s used in a lawful way, Galperin thinks parents should not spy on their children without telling them, and without their consent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If parents do inform their children and get their go-ahead, parents should stay away from insecure and untrustworthy stalkerware apps, and use parental tracking tools built into <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/105107\">Apple phones and tablets</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7326816\">Android devices</a> that are safer and operate overtly.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-recap-of-breaches-and-leaks\"><strong>Recap of breaches and leaks</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s the complete list of stalkerware companies that have been hacked or have leaked sensitive data since 2017, in chronological order:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em></em><em>First published on July 16, 2024 and updated to include uMobix as the latest stalkerware apps to have a security issue.</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence.

The company raised $13 billion in equity funding <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">just five months ago</a>, but intense competition between frontier labs and the ongoing cost of compute has made it eager to raise as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Firms expected to participate in the round include Altimeter Capital Management, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Coatue Management, Iconiq Capital, and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, but the bulk of the funding is said to come from the company’s strategic partners Nvidia and Microsoft.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is building on recent successes, most notably the deployment of its coding agents, which have software engineers raving about increased coding productivity.

From years of broadcast archives to thousands of store cameras and countless hours of production footage, most of it just sits unused on servers, <a href=\"https://www.iconik.io/blog/what-is-dark-data-and-why-you-should-care\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unwatched and unanalyzed</a>. This is dark data: a massive, untapped resource that companies collect automatically but almost never use in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To tackle the problem, Aza Kai (CEO) and Hiraku Yanagita (COO), two former Googlers who spent nearly a decade working together at Google Japan, decided to build their own solution. The duo co-founded <a href=\"https://infinimind.io/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">InfiniMind</a>, a Tokyo-based startup developing infrastructure that converts petabytes of unviewed video and audio into structured, queryable business data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My co-founder, who spent a decade leading brand and data solutions at Google Japan, and I saw this inflection point coming while we were still at Google,” Kai said. By 2024, the technology had matured, and the market demand had become clear enough that the co-founders felt compelled to build the company themselves, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kai, who previously worked at Google Japan across cloud, machine learning, ad systems, and video recommendation models and later led data science teams, explained that current solutions force a trade-off. Earlier approaches could label objects in individual frames, but they couldn’t track narratives, understand causality, or answer complex questions about video content. For clients with decades of broadcast archives and petabytes of footage, even basic questions about their content often went unanswered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What really changed was the progress in vision-language models between 2021 and 2023. That’s when video AI started moving beyond simple object tagging, Kai noted. Falling GPU costs and annual performance gains of roughly 15% to 20% over the last decade helped, but the bigger story was capability — until recently, models just couldn’t do the job, he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">InfiniMind recently secured $5.8 million in seed funding, led by UTEC and joined by CX2, Headline Asia, Chiba Dojo, and an AI researcher at a16z Scout. The company is relocating its headquarters to the U.S., while it continues to operate an office in Japan. Japan provided the perfect testbed: strong hardware, talented engineers, and a supportive startup ecosystem,<strong> </strong>allowing the team to fine-tune its technology with demanding customers before going global.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its first product, TV Pulse, launched in Japan in April 2025. The AI-powered platform analyzes television content in real time, helping media and retail companies “track product exposure, brand presence, customer sentiment, and PR impact,” per the startup. After pilot programs with major broadcasters and agencies, it already has paying customers, including wholesalers and media companies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, InfiniMind is ready for the international market. Its flagship product, DeepFrame, a long-form video intelligence platform capable of processing 200 hours of footage to pinpoint specific scenes, speakers, or events, is scheduled for a beta release in March, followed by a full launch in April 2026, Kai said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090794\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/InfiniMind-team-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>infinimind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The video analysis space is highly fragmented. Companies such as TwelveLabs provide general-purpose video understanding APIs for a broad range of users, including consumers, prosumers, and enterprises, Kai said, while InfiniMind focuses specifically on enterprise use cases, including monitoring, safety, security, and analyzing video content for deeper insights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our solution requires no code; clients bring their data, and our system processes it, providing actionable insights,” Kai said. “We also integrate audio, sound, and speech understanding, not just visuals. Our system can handle unlimited video length, and cost efficiency is a major differentiator. Most existing solutions prioritize accuracy or specific use cases but don’t solve cost challenges.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed funding will help the team continue developing the DeepFrame model, expand engineering infrastructure, hire more engineers, and reach additional customers across Japan and the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is an exciting space, one of the paths toward AGI,” Kai said. “Understanding general video intelligence is about understanding reality. Industrial applications are important, but our ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of technology to better understand reality and help humans make better decisions.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s worth noting that location sharing on Snap Map is off by default. No one can see your location or receive an alert unless you choose to share it, Snapchat explained. One-time alerts expire after they’re sent or after 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use Arrival Notifications, you need to share your location with a trusted friend that you want to keep in the loop. Then, you need to tap on your friendship profile and scroll down to “Arrival Notifications.” You can pick a location on the map and give it a personal name. For example, you could set the location for your “run club” or the location for “piano lessons.” You can then choose a one-time or recurring alert, after which Snapchat will notify your friend when you arrive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature comes as Snapchat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/snap-map-reaches-new-milestone-of-400m-monthly-active-users/\">announced last summer that Snap Map</a> now has more than 400 million monthly active users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. The feature now also offers ways for users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/03/snapchat-restaurant-recommendations-snap-map/\">discover local hotspots</a> and find things to do.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its Home Safe and Arrival Notifications features, Snapchat is looking to further compete with services like the family location-sharing app Life360 and Apple’s “Find My.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Over the past few years, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\">dozens of stalkerware apps</a> have been hacked, or have managed to lose, spill, or expose people’s private data — often the victims themselves — thanks to shoddy cybersecurity by the stalkerware operators.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tTo contact Zack Whittaker securely, reach out via Signal username zackwhittaker.1337.

The customer records did not include dates of payments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch verified the data was authentic by taking several transaction records containing disposable email addresses with public inboxes, such as Mailinator, and running them through the various password reset portals provided by the various surveillance apps. By resetting the passwords on accounts associated with public email addresses, we determined that these were real accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We also verified the data by matching each transaction’s unique invoice number from the leaked dataset with the surveillance vendor’s checkout pages. We could do this because the checkout page allowed us to retrieve the same customer and transaction data from the server without needing a password.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacktivist, who goes by the moniker “wikkid,” told TechCrunch they scraped the data from the stalkerware vendor thanks to a “trivial” bug in its website. The hacktivist said they “have fun targeting apps that are used to spy on people,” and subsequently published the scraped data on a known hacking forum.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacking forum listing lists the surveillance vendor as Ersten Group, which presents itself as a U.K.-presenting software development startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch found several email addresses in the dataset used for testing and customer support instead reference Struktura, a Ukrainian company that has an identical website to Ersten Group. The earliest record in the dataset contained the email address for Struktura’s chief executive, Viktoriia Zosim, for a transaction of $1. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Representatives for Ersten Group did not respond to our requests for comment. Struktura’s Zosim did not return a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
