That means it can now directly issue credit and debit cards and offer its spend management products to any business in all 30 EU countries with “no workarounds required,” as co-founder and CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote <a href=\"https://www.brex.com/journal/eu-license?ref_code=os_lin_EUblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the corporate spend management startup previously supported 60 currencies in 200 countries, it could only sell its products to companies with a U.S. presence. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the expansion, Brex is now authorized to sell spend management (complete with issuing cards) and other tools like embedded payments to EU companies and startups, a spokesperson tells TechCrunch. However, there’s a caveat: Banking and bill pay will not be initially available. The company hopes to roll those services out in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this is good news for Brex, it may also be good news for European startups. Brex’s claim to fame is offering startups expense management cards for their employees even if they wouldn’t yet qualify from traditional banks. Without a bank account offering, the youngest EU startups will still have to weigh their options.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next up, Franceschi says he wants to expand Brex in the U.K., though he offered no specifics on those plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Franceschi <a href=\"https://www.brex.com/journal/brex-in-founder-mode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in December</a> that Brex is on track to stop burning cash in 2025, “an important milestone to our future IPO.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February, sources told various news outlets that Brex was on track for $500 million in revenue this year as well. That’s quite the turnaround from a shaky moment in 2023 when Brex conducted layoffs and reportedly told employees that its cash burn was too high. There has been no hint yet as to when that IPO may take place, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brex’s competitive win in the international market comes as its U.S. fintech competitors are having an overall moment. Ramp has been raising money from VCs like mad, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/ramp-hits-22-5b-valuation-just-45-days-after-reaching-16b/?_thumbnail_id=2680663\">hitting a $22.5 billion valuation just 45 days</a> after a round with a $16 billion valuation. In March, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/26/fintech-mercury-lands-300m-in-sequoia-led-series-c-doubles-valuation-to-3-5b/\">Mercury raised a fresh $300 million</a> and doubled its valuation to $3.5 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brex has not publicly announced new equity VC funding since 2022, when it raised $300 million in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/\">Series D-2 round at a $12.3 billion</a> valuation. It did, however, secure a fresh $260 million worth of debt in <a href=\"https://www.brex.com/journal/press/brex-inc-closes-oversubscribed-third-securitization-issuance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">March 2024</a>, backed by its spend management products, to help it pay for its cash-intensive business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newest piece of infrastructure coming to Starbase, Texas, isn’t a launch mount or a booster. It’s a water pipeline, and who can hook up a tap (and on what terms) will shape the definition of “company town.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new line, which will stretch from Brownsville to the newly incorporated city of Starbase, will replace the truck-hauled deliveries SpaceX has used to transport potable water for its employees and on-site residents. Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB) COO Mark Dombroski confirmed the line at a July 16 meeting, saying the board had executed a contract with SpaceX to provide water as an in-city customer. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The BPUB approved the SpaceX contract on June 2, Dombroski told TechCrunch over email. He did not explain why SpaceX is being treated as an in-city nonresidential customer, which carries a cheaper rate class than outside-city customers, despite the fact that the company did, indeed, establish its own city.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Under a non-standard development agreement, SpaceX will extend — at their cost — a line to a metering point within the city limits, then transport the water to Starbase,” he continued. “They will also pay for and construct the improvements needed for BPUB to deliver water to the meter. This arrangement is intended to supersede the water hauling arrangement after SpaceX starts taking water through the meter. Timing is driven largely by SpaceX’s construction schedule.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potable water deliveries have been constrained by a 60,000 gallons per day cap under the current hauled-water purchase agreement between BPUB and SpaceX, according to a January 2024 letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The pipeline would change that, making it easier for SpaceX to build out more amenities and housing for employees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For a handful of non-SpaceX affiliated homes, getting access to that water may come with some terms and conditions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July, nearly 40 properties along the stretch between Brownsville and Boca Chica were abruptly cut off from the county water service, <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/spacex-starbase-cameron-county-water-cutoff-20777749.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the San Antonio Express-News. </a>Cameron County previously delivered fresh water as a “courtesy” service to these properties, but the county now says it is Starbase’s responsibility to deliver water to these residents. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase disagrees: In July, Starbase city administrator Kent Myers reportedly sent a letter to a Cameron County commissioner saying the abrupt water cutoff “poses safety and public health risks.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase “has neither the legal authority nor operational capacity to deliver water to these residents,” Myers said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, SpaceX has reportedly distributed an “unconditional and perpetual agreement” to non-SpaceX affiliated homes that would exchange access to Starbase’s water and sewer system for residents’ agreement to leave the area for “any and all launch, testing and other operational activities.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document also states that “SpaceX has no obligation to provide residents with access to SpaceX’s water and wastewater treatment,” nor does it guarantee the quality or volume of water and blocks residents from seeking “legal or monetary recourse” against the company.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-city-with-no-utilities\">A city — with no utilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newly incorporated city of Starbase, governed by SpaceX executives, is a separate municipal entity adjacent to and encompassing SpaceX’s sprawling South Texas launch site. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/04/residents-of-spacexs-starbase-launch-site-vote-to-incorporate-as-a-city/\">The city was incorporated in May</a>. Only registered voters within the proposed boundary were allowed to vote on the incorporation. There were 247 lots inside that boundary, and only 10 were not owned by SpaceX, according to an affidavit submitted by SpaceX senior manager of spaceport operations Richard Cardile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even before the vote was cast, SpaceX had been working behind the scenes to formalize potable water provisions for employees and residents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX established a state-regulated drinking-water system, replete with a half-a-million-gallon ground storage tank, plus service pumps, a chlorine analyzer, tank mixer, and other hardware, according to TCEQ records. The central water system, which is supplied by the two water haulers, is small compared to a city utility, but sizable for an on-site, industrial operation. It serves 239 residential service connections, or meters, which can include multiple units.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase’s role is limited by design: “The City of Starbase does not provide any utility services,” Myers told TechCrunch. “These services are provided by SpaceX within the City Limits.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, that means the forthcoming Brownsville-Starbase pipeline would feed a private, SpaceX-run water system. Neighbors don’t automatically gain a right to a tap; any connection would be at SpaceX’s discretion, and on SpaceX’s terms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The planned pipeline solves near-term scarcity for SpaceX employees and their families but doesn’t create a public right to water. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to public records, SpaceX has not obtained a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN), a Texas Public Utility Commission authorization that determines who may retail water, so has no obligation to serve third parties. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch’s questions on whether it will be adding public utilities to its long list of commercial services. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The next-generation model signals a new era for ChatGPT — and its creator, OpenAI — pointing to OpenAI’s broader ambitions to develop AI systems that are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/03/inside-openais-quest-to-make-ai-do-anything-for-you/\">more like agents</a> than chatbots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/openai-launches-gpt-4-turbo-and-launches-fine-tuning-program-for-gpt-4/\">GPT-4</a> enabled AI chatbots to offer smart responses on a wide variety of questions, GPT-5 allows ChatGPT to complete a wide variety of tasks on behalf of users — such as generating software applications, navigating a user’s calendar, or creating research briefs. <br><br>With GPT-5, OpenAI has also sought to make ChatGPT simpler to use. Instead of asking users to choose the right settings, GPT-5 comes equipped with a real-time router that decides how to offer the best answer, whether that’s responding to user questions quickly or taking additional time to “think” through answers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035064\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png 4267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GPT5-All-Together-16x9-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a briefing with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed GPT-5 is “the best model in the world,” and said it represented a “significant step” along the company’s path to developing AI that can outperform humans at most economically valuable work — that is, artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Having something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable at any previous time in history,” said Altman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starting Thursday, GPT-5 will be available to all free users of ChatGPT as their default model. OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, said this is part of the company’s effort to give free users access to an AI reasoning model for the first time. (Previously, the company gated these more advanced models behind a paywall.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is just one of the ways that I’m excited to live the mission, making sure that this stuff actually benefits people,” said Turley on the decision, referencing OpenAI’s long-standing <a href=\"https://openai.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mission</a> to distribute advanced AI to as many people as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expectations are high for GPT-5, one of OpenAI’s most anticipated product launches since ChatGPT put the company on the map in 2022. Since then, ChatGPT has grown into one of the world’s most popular consumer products, reaching more than 700 million users every week — nearly 10% of the globe’s population, according to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many see GPT-5 as a bellwether for AI progress broadly, and the model’s reception by Silicon Valley could have profound implications for Big Tech, Wall Street, and policymakers regulating technology. These stakeholders are watching to see if GPT-5 offers a significant jump in AI’s capabilities, much like its predecessor, GPT-4, which challenged expectations of what software can do.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gpt-5-offers-a-slight-edge-on-the-competition\">GPT-5 offers a slight edge on the competition</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI claims GPT-5 is state-of-the-art in several domains, slightly edging out leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Elon Musk’s xAI on key benchmarks. However, GPT-5 slightly underperforms frontier AI models in other areas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says GPT-5 offers frontier-level performance around coding; Altman said the model specifically excels at spinning up entire software applications on demand, in what’s become known as “vibe coding.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On SWE-bench Verified — a test of real-world coding tasks pulled from GitHub — GPT-5 scores 74.9% on its first attempt. That means GPT-5 just outperforms Anthropic’s latest Claude Opus 4.1 model, which scored <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">74.5%</a>, and Google DeepMind’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">59.6%</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Humanity’s Last Exam — a difficult test measuring AI model performance across math, humanities, and the natural sciences — a version of GPT-5 with extended reasoning (GPT-5 Pro) scored 42% when using tools. That’s slightly less than xAI was able to achieve with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/\">Grok 4 Heavy</a>, which scored 44.4% on the test.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035062\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png 1756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=1200,794 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=1280,847 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=430,285 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=720,476 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=900,596 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=800,529 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=1536,1016 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=668,442 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=567,375 567w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=932,617 932w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=708,469 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-07-at-12.56.46PM.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On GPQA Diamond — a test of PhD-level science questions — GPT-5 pro scored 89.4% on its first try, outperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 80.9%, and Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 88.9%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says GPT-5 is better for answering health-related questions. On a test measuring accuracy in AI model responses around healthcare topics, HealthBench Hard Hallucinations, OpenAI says GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates just 1.6% of the time. This is far lower than the company’s previous GPT-4o and o3 models, which scored 12.9% and 15.8, respectively. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI chatbots are not medical professionals, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-chatbot-medical-advice-study-1235399973/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">millions of people</a> are using them for health advice.

Turley said GPT-5 responds more naturally and exhibits “better taste” than other AI models on creative tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The vibes of this model are really good,” said Turley.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5 is also more accurate than OpenAI’s previous models, and the company says it suffers far less from hallucinations — the tendency for AI models to make up information — compared to its o-series models. Hallucinations seemed to be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/\">getting worse</a> in OpenAI’s latest AI reasoning models, such as o3, and OpenAI previously said it didn’t quite understand why it was happening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In responses to ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI found that GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates and responds with incorrect information 4.8% of the time. That’s a significant reduction from o3 and GPT-4o, which score hallucination rates of 22% and 20.6%, respectively, on the test.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a benchmark measuring an AI model’s agentic ability to complete simulated online tasks, Tau-bench, GPT-5 offers mixed performance. On part of the test measuring an AI’s ability to navigate an airline’s website, GPT-5 scores 63.5%, slightly underperforming o3, which scored 64.8%. On another part of the test measuring AI’s ability to navigate retail websites, GPT-5 scores 81.1%, underperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 82.4%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI also says that GPT-5 is safer than its previous models. While AI reasoning models occasionally exhibit a tendency to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/openais-o1-model-sure-tries-to-deceive-humans-a-lot/\">scheme against humans</a> or lie to promote their own goals, OpenAI found that GPT-5 was deceptive at a lower rate than other models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alex Beutel, OpenAI’s safety research lead, said reducing deception improves not only the safety of GPT-5, but also the user experience, creating a model that’s more “transparent and honest in ways users can trust.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beutel also notes GPT-5 is better at discerning between bad actors who are trying to misuse ChatGPT and users making harmless requests. This results in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-upgrades-for-consumers-and-developers\">Upgrades for consumers and developers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is getting a few user experience upgrades as part of the GPT-5 launch. Users can now select from four new personalities in ChatGPT’s setting: Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd. The company says these will adapt ChatGPT’s responses without requiring users to specifically ask the model to respond in a certain way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subscribers to ChatGPT’s $20-per-month Plus plan get higher usage limits for GPT-5 than free users. Meanwhile, $200-per-month Pro subscribers will have unlimited access to GPT-5, as well as a souped-up version called GPT-5 Pro that uses additional computational resources to produce better answers. Organizations on OpenAI’s Team, Edu, and Enterprise plans will gain access to GPT-5 as their default model next week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For developers, GPT-5 is coming to OpenAI’s API in three sizes — gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano — which will spend more or less time “reasoning” through tasks. Developers can also now control verbosity in the OpenAI API, deciding how long or short an AI model’s responses should be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The base model of GPT-5 will cost developers $1.25 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the entire “Lord of the Rings” series) and $10 per million output tokens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch of GPT-5 comes after a busy week for OpenAI. The company released an open-weight reasoning model, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/openai-launches-two-open-ai-reasoning-models/\">gpt-oss</a>, that developers and enterprises can download for free and run at a fraction of the cost. The open model nearly matched the abilities of OpenAI’s previous top models, o3 and o4-mini, but GPT-5 sets a new standard for frontier performance in some areas, such as coding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, GPT-5 seems to be roughly on par with other frontier AI models in several areas. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story for any AI model, and it remains to be seen how developers will use GPT-5 in the real world, and whether the model is truly a step above the competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We — Airbnb — can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Painting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the things we’ve noticed is it’s not enough to just have … the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that’s the key,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can’t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb’s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, AI will come to Airbnb’s search next year, the CEO said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it’s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because of this, Chesky doesn’t think agentic AI would turn its business into a commodity, the way that booking flights has become. Instead, he sees AI as “potentially interesting lead generation” for the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the key thing is going to be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that’s something that we’re certainly open to,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb beat analysts’ expectations in the quarter with revenue of $3.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.03, but the stock <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/airbnb-dips-slower-growth-outlook-renews-fears-travel-demand-slowdown-2025-08-07/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped</a> on its forecast of slower growth in the second half of the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Duolingo stock rose <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/duolingo-earnings-stock-price-e8ea55ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">almost 30%</a> on the news.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In April, CEO Luis von Ahn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322560534824865792/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared</a> that Duolingo would become an “AI-first” company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,” von Ahn wrote at the time. “We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company’s financial metrics tell a different story. Now the company <a href=\"https://investors.duolingo.com/static-files/0b55110c-2eb9-466d-8549-5459e0851290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">anticipates</a> making over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company’s estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday’s quarterly earnings call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn’t give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,” von Ahn said. “The most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo’s videos often remain criticisms of the company’s AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, “Nope. Made by our great team!” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not … and from the company’s perspective, that’s what matters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Nonetheless, the social media platform maintains control over which sources of information the AI search engine draws from.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truth Social is using the Perplexity Sonar API, which promises to query the web to retrieve current and verified information — even if that information is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/perplexity-accused-of-scraping-websites-that-explicitly-blocked-ai-scraping/\">scraped from websites that block Perplexity’s crawlers</a> — and supports structured output so users can define the format in which they’d like to see the search engine’s responses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jesse Dwyer, a Perplexity spokesperson, told TechCrunch that the Sonar API will be accurate to whatever sources Truth Social limits it to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have no visibility or control over that,” Dwyer said. “Similar to you using the API inside of your own company or if you were an academic researcher and wanted to use it to search your own data.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Trump Media to learn more about whether Truth Search AI will have access to the entire web, whether it will prioritize certain sources over others, and whether the AI will be directed to respond favorably about the president and current administration and unfavorably toward Democrats. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To assess which sources the searchbot would cite, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/06/trump-truth-social-perplexity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios</a> asked it a bunch of questions — like “What happened on January 6, 2021?” and “Why was Donald Trump impeached?” In all the responses, <a href=\"http://foxnews.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FoxNews.com</a> was either the most common or the only listed source of information.

The first two MuSat XL spacecraft will deliver a 12-hour global revisit time and detect Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals at 30 times lower power than current capabilities, Hubble says. If those numbers pan out, it could materially extend battery life for tracking tags and sensors here on Earth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those two satellites will form the backbone of Hubble’s BLE Finding Network for enterprises in sectors ranging from logistics, infrastructure, and defense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hubble <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/hubble-network-connects-a-bluetooth-chip-to-a-satellite-for-the-first-time/\">made history in 2024</a> when it became the first company to establish a Bluetooth connection directly to a satellite. The startup’s proposition is compelling: Instead of needing to buy specialized hardware, customers will only need to integrate their devices’ chipsets with a piece of firmware to enable connection to the Hubble network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits of the space-based network are massive, Hubble argues: It can provide visibility across the globe, including in remote areas, and offers a developer-friendly way to let companies track assets without building any additional infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently has seven spacecraft on orbit with a target of having 60 satellites in operation by 2028. The long-term goal is to upgrade the entire constellation to the larger platform buses because of their power and performance upgrades, Haro said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an aggressive schedule, but Haro added that one reason Hubble chose to partner with Muon is the latter’s ability to rapidly scale manufacturing to hit this goal, despite being a young company. (A recent <a href=\"https://www.muonspace.com/press/muon-space-completes-146-million-series-b-to-scale-satellite-constellations-for-defense-and-commercial-missions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$146 million funding round</a> should help.) Gregory Smirin, president of Muon Space, told TechCrunch that the company’s San Jose production facility is being built out to support production of over 500 spacecraft per year by 2027. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hubble is the first customer for the 500 kilogram-class MuSat XL satellite platform, which Muon says can provide multi-kilowatt power to payloads, optical crosslinks, high-volume downlink, and “near real-time” communications for time-sensitive missions. The partnership also signals a bigger push by the company to compete for more lucrative contracts with the Department of Defense. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The XL platform “is a perfect size and capability for SDA Tranche missions,” Smirin said, referring to the Space Development Agency’s initiative to build out a missile defense constellation in low Earth orbit. “XL reflects both the evolution of our technical stack and our growing role in delivering the kind of multi-mission spacecraft that programs like SDA increasingly rely on.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Muon’s business model can be thought of as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/muon-space-closes-56m-to-scale-all-in-one-satellite-platform/\">space-as-a-service</a>: The company designs, builds, and operates satellites using a vertically integrated stack of hardware and software. The stack, called Halo, is meant to open up space access for companies with promising payloads but no interest in building the underlying satellite architecture. In practice, that means Hubble can focus on developing the BLE network while Muon handles the satellite platforms and mission operations. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new entity will support contract types, including agent of record, employer of record, and staff augmentation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwork president and CEO Hayden Brown told TechCrunch that the timing was right to launch this new enterprise-focused business because Upwork’s existing enterprise customers have been increasingly asking for access to these talent pools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of the providers that exist today force their customers to choose between flexibility and compliance, or speed and scale, or having a digital tool versus having something that’s actually robust and for the enterprise,” Brown said. “And with this new capability, we’re refusing to compromise. We’re giving our customers all of the benefits they’ve been looking for, and we’ve heard loud and clear that they want this singular solution.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown said that Upwork’s existing enterprise business makes up about $100 million of the company’s overall $750 million in yearly revenue.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwork decided to make the enterprise business a stand-alone entity because enterprises have very different needs regarding compliance and software integrations than the small and midsize businesses Upwork’s main business works with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keeping them separate allows for better external branding and better internal focus, Brown said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwork vetted more than 100 potential companies to acquire to build out this business, Brown said. The company landed on Bubty and Ascen not only for what they bring separately but also for how they worked together — Upwork piloted the companies both individually and together.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We saw through the power of those pilots how impactful their technology was and how easy it was to basically snap together what each of them offers, along with our existing offering to deliver something very new and innovative in the market,” Brown added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Details on the branding and full offerings of the new stand-alone business are set to be unveiled later this year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But Google on Wednesday denied that’s the case, at least in aggregate.

And while chatbots like ChatGPT have certainly seen traffic increase in recent months, that doesn’t mean online publishers aren’t suffering.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3009660\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg 2224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1200,599 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1280,639 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=720,359 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=900,449 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=800,399 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1536,767 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=2048,1022 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=668,333 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=1236,617 1236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=708,353 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-overviews-io.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has been revamping its search engine for years to answer more questions directly on the search results page, and now does so with AI through its “AI Overviews” that appear at the top of search results. Google also allows users to interact with an AI chatbot for some queries. Yet Google denies that this is significantly reshaping the search landscape. Rather, it points to users shifting their attention to other sites to start their queries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reid explains, “People are increasingly seeking out and clicking on sites with forums, videos, podcasts, and posts where they can hear authentic voices and first-hand perspectives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reading between the lines, it seems like Google.com isn’t necessarily people’s first stop on the web these days. (Google denies this, telling us that Reid’s commentary is only reflective of trends it’s seeing in traffic to sites from Google.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, we’ve seen this trend for some time. Back in 2022, a Google exec even said that social sites like TikTok and Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps/\">were eating into Google’s core products</a>, like Search and Maps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they’re looking for a place for lunch, they don’t go to Google Maps or Search,” said Google SVP Prabhakar Raghavan, who ran the company’s Knowledge and Information organization at the time (he is now its chief technologist). “They go to TikTok or Instagram,” he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has also long been worried that Amazon.com had become people’s first stop for online shopping searches, and Reddit.com had become the first stop for researching topics of interest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over many years, the company has tried to come up with compelling features for both consumers and retailers that would attract more users to Google Shopping. These efforts have included <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/google-introduces-shopping-actions-to-help-retailers-in-their-battle-with-amazon/\">universal shopping carts</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/google-lens-new-feature-makes-it-easier-to-shop-products-in-store/\">local inventory checks</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/01/google-search-new-shopping-features-get-better-deal/\">deal finders</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/google-adds-news-ways-to-shop-like-turning-a-websites-photos-into-shoppable-products/\">shopping from product images on websites</a>, and more. It even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/\">made its Shopping listings free</a> for merchants in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, as users <a href=\"https://dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complained that Google Search quality was declining</a>, the search giant was seeing so much demand for Reddit that it finally <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/google-search-now-queries-reddit-and-quora-in-response-to-open-ended-questions/#!\">added a “Reddit” filter</a> to allow users to narrow down results on relevant search queries. (Now that filter simply reads “forums.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So perhaps there’s some truth in Google’s denials — it’s not AI that’s entirely responsible for killing search. Search was already dying. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"A person holding an iPhone and using Google AI Mode\" class=\"wp-image-3017226\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg 5196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2206888090.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Smith Collection/Gado / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s new blog post also attempts to move the goalposts a bit about what it means for websites receiving Google’s clicks. Now, instead of counting clicks, it wants publishers to think about click quality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says average click quality has increased, and Google is sending “slightly more quality clicks” to websites than a year ago. (Google explains that a quality click is one where users don’t quickly click back — they stay and read.) How much of an increase, though, Google doesn’t say. The company only points out that when people click through on an AI response to the source, they’re more likely to dive deeper, so those clicks are more valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, Google paints AI as an opportunity for web publishers to gain increased exposure, saying that “with AI Overviews, people are seeing more links on the page than before,” Reid writes. “More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/ai-referrals-to-top-websites-were-up-357-year-over-year-in-june-reaching-1-13b/\">while a growing referral source</a>, isn’t <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/chatgpt-referrals-to-news-sites-are-growing-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines/\">yet making up the difference</a> in terms of clicks, reports have shown. One recent study from Similarweb indicates that the number of news searches on the web resulting in zero clicks to news websites has grown from 56% (when Google launched AI Overviews in May 2024) to 69% as of May 2025. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3024257\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg 1912w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=300,254 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=768,650 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=680,575 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1200,1015 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1280,1083 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=430,364 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=720,609 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=900,762 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=800,677 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=1536,1300 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=668,565 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=443,375 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=729,617 729w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=627,531 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similarweb-AI-news-report-2025-07-02-at-1.01.35PM.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Similarweb</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google appears to know this is a trend, too, as it recently launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/as-ai-kills-search-traffic-google-launches-offerwall-to-boost-publisher-revenue/\">a product for publishers</a> that helps them monetize their dwindling traffic in other ways that don’t rely only on advertising, like micropayments or newsletter sign-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that Google is pushing this <em>“</em>AI is not the end of search traffic!” PR now only makes the situation seem more dire.

Tea is advertised as a women’s safety app with more than 6 million users that is similar to “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/02/dating-same-guy-facebook-groups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Are we dating the same guy?</a>” Facebook networks. However, the app is controversial, since many of the claims that women post cannot be verified.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The backlash surrounding Tea escalated last week, after 404 Media reported 4chan users retaliated by <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/women-dating-safety-app-tea-breached-users-ids-posted-to-4chan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discovering a publicly exposed database</a> belonging to the app, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/dating-safety-app-tea-breached-exposing-72000-user-images/\">revealed</a> over 72,000 images, including thousands of selfies and photo IDs submitted for account verification. A <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about-abortions-and-cheating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">subsequent hack</a> exposed more than 1 million private messages sent over the app, prompting the app to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/tea-apps-data-breach-gets-much-worse-exposing-over-a-million-private-messages/\">disable</a> its messaging feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TeaOnHer, which is now ranked No. 2 among Lifestyle apps on iOS, appears to be a direct rebuttal to the Tea app, even copying the language from Tea’s App Store description in its own listing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But like the app it sought to emulate, TeaOnHer contains security flaws of its own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has found at least one security flaw that allows anyone access to data belonging to TeaOnHer app users, including their usernames and associated email addresses, as well as driver’s licenses and selfies that users uploaded to TeaOnHer. Images of these driver’s licenses are publicly accessible web addresses, allowing anyone with the links to access them using their web browser.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one case, TechCrunch saw a list of posts shared on TeaOnHer appended with each user’s email address, display name, and self-reported location.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch is withholding some of the details of the bugs so as to not help malicious actors access anyone’s data. The app’s maker did not respond to emails from TechCrunch asking who we can report the flaws to. As such, TechCrunch is publishing this report with limited details of the issue, given the app’s current popularity and the risk faced with using the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TeaOnHer was uploaded to the iOS App Store by a developer named Newville Media Corporation. According to LinkedIn, the founder and CEO of this company is Xavier Lampkin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch identified at least one TeaOnHer record associated with Lampkin’s own data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The security lapse will likely affect any user who signed up or shared identity documents with the app. The bug also exposes the number of users the TeaOnHer app has, which is about 53,000 users at the time of publication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch also identified a potential second security issue, in which an email address and plaintext password belonging to the app’s creator, Lampkin, was left exposed on the server. The credentials appear to grant access to the app’s “admin” panel. TechCrunch did not use the credentials, as doing so would be unlawful, but highlights the risks of inadvertently leaving admin credentials exposed to the web.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with its security flaws, the content portrayed within TeaOnHer is troubling in itself. While the app requests IDs and selfies from its users to verify their identities — a process that is not automatic — users can access a “guest” view of the app without signing in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Immediately upon opening “guest” view, TechCrunch saw several images of the same naked woman, posted under different names in a form of spam. It is not clear if this woman consented to this photo being shared. Other posts share the photos and names of women, alongside comments calling them “easy,” or accusing them of spreading sexually transmitted infections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across all free apps, TeaOnHer is ranked No. 17, higher than apps like Instagram, Netflix, Uber, and Spotify. Tea is currently ranked No. 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Zoox had argued that it did and announced in July 2022 that it had self-certified; NHTSA balked. The agency opened an investigation in March 2023 to look into the matter, and specifically the process and data that Zoox had used to self-certify.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investigation didn’t slow Zoox’s development and testing of its autonomous vehicle technology. In early 2023, Zoox began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/13/zoox-robotaxis-start-slowly-rolling-out-on-california-public-roads/\">testing its custom-built robotaxis</a>, which don’t have a steering wheel or other traditional controls, on public roads near its Foster City, California headquarters. The company has since expanded its testing footprint to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/zoox-custom-robotaxis-are-finally-coming-to-san-francisco-and-las-vegas/\">Las Vegas and San Francisco</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox does not operate a commercial service yet. However, in San Francisco it has opened its robotaxis up to employees and hosted family and friends. Earlier this year, the company launched an Zoox Explorer program, aimed at early public riders, in Las Vegas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the exemption allows Zoox to demonstrate the robotaxis, not operate them commercially. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NHTSA’s announcement is connected to its <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-proposes-national-program-vehicles-automated-driving-systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new national framework</a>, which the agency argues will make it easier for companies to deploy autonomous vehicles without traditional manual driving controls — like steering wheels, pedals, and sideview mirrors — at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The framework allows NHTSA to green-light the sale and commercialization of autonomous vehicles that are not compliant with federal safety standards due to a lack of manual controls. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revised process involves an expedited application that allows companies like Zoox to receive exemptions for testing and demonstrations, and eventually, commercial operations. Zoox spokesperson Whitney Jencks said in an email that Zoox is working in close cooperation with NHTSA on this process, beginning with the demonstration exemption and followed by the commercial exemption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the agreement, NHTSA has closed its investigation into Zoox’s self-certification of its AVs. Zoox has agreed to remove or cover all statements that its purpose-built vehicles comply with applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A Fire TV ran in the bedroom. And, in a drawer, a rarely used Fire HD tablet sat collecting dust.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the <a href=\"https://x.com/SarahPerezTC/status/1767981332578078790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">total loss of the home due to a March 2024 house fire</a>, there also came a new opportunity: We could now make a fresh start to create a more modernized smart home after rebuilding our house. But whether Alexa still deserves to be the center of our connected home remains to be seen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To find out whether Alexa is still the best smart assistant for my family, I’m going to test Amazon’s AI-powered devices, experiment with AI queries, and write out my thoughts in a multi-part series.

Today, people can engage with AI via text and voice chat. Modern AI chatbots and AI-powered services can answer so many more questions, are imaginative, can reason, can create images and art, and generate videos, and with the agentic AI, they can even perform online tasks on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/amazon-unveils-a-new-and-improved-alexa-alexa/\">Amazon announced a complete makeover of its digital voice assistant</a> with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI. That service began rolling out slowly to customers in March and is now available to “many millions” of users, Amazon says. The system is also model-agnostic, meaning Alexa+ can use whatever she needs in the moment to answer the question or complete the task. Alexa+ is using models from Anthropic and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/amazon-announces-nova-a-new-family-of-multimodal-ai-models/\">Amazon Nova</a>, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company teased that this improved Alexa could do more than set timers and alarms, control smart home devices, and answer questions. She leverages generative AI to make sense of information stored in Amazon users’ accounts, understand their schedules, and their preferences. She can remember things, process files, and summarize a Ring camera’s footage.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034654\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/artifact-expression-2000x1125-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Amazon says it’s been working with partners to allow it to take actions for people, like booking dinner reservations or Uber rides, or buying concert tickets. Integrations with Amazon’s own grocery service could also have it make shopping lists by speaking to it, and then have those products delivered. Essentially, it’s aiming to bring agentic AI into the home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before we can get to that, let’s see how Alexa+ handles the basics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the first part of this series, I’m going to set up Alexa+, use the app, and ask the assistant some questions that only the new Alexa+ can do.

Our family calendar is maintained in Google Calendar, accessed on our phones through the native Google Calendar app, and on Mac desktops via the calendar app Fantastical.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon suggests that Alexa+ can help summarize your day, add new events to your calendar, identify conflicts, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, Alexa was fairly adept at letting me inquire about the schedule and various events, but she interrupted me when I was asking to add a new meeting to my calendar. I said, “Can you add a meeting to my calendar on August 6 at 2 p.m. with [entity] about—” Here she cut me off to ask, “What would you like to title this meeting?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Annoying, but not end-of-the-world terrible, I suppose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I was more easily able to ask things like “What’s on my calendar today?” and follow up to ask further questions — like if there were any meetings later in the week or to repeat one of the appointments. I didn’t have to say “Alexa” again to continue the conversation. It felt more natural, but there’s a very slight lag with her responses at times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(As an aside, when I went to find the history of my voice chats for writing this post, I asked Alexa where they could be found. She told me to look in the app’s Settings under the More menu, then look for Alexa Privacy or Review Voice History. She’s wrong. Neither option was there. I did, however, find my history from the “Recent Chats” link on the app’s home screen. Alexa, c’mon! Know thyself.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-alexa-remember-this\">Alexa, remember this</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another thing Alexa+ is supposed to be able to do is store information on your behalf. To test this out, I asked her to remember my frequent flier number. This interaction went poorly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Alexa, can you remember my Delta SkyMiles number?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: Sure, I’d be happy to remember your Delta SkyMiles number for you. What’s the number?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: *opens mouth to speak*</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: I’ve added that to Remember This in the Alexa privacy section of the app. Also, keep in mind that anyone who has access to any of your Alexa devices can use their voice to hear its contents.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Um, what? I tried again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Alexa, can you remember my SkyMiles number?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: Certainly! I’d be happy to remember your SkyMiles number for you. What’s the number? OK, saved it.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She didn’t even take a breath!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Curious, I asked her what she thinks the number is. She responded, “I don’t have your SkyMiles number saved yet. Would you like to tell me your number now?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Yes.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: OK, go ahead and tell me your Delta SkyMiles number.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: [says the eight-digit number]</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: OK, saved it.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: What’s my SkyMiles number?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: “Six hundred fifty-two million, four hundred eighty-six thousand…” </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Note: I changed the number for the purpose of this post, but yes, Alexa read it out like a long numeral instead of just saying 6-5-2-4-8-6, etc. Not helpful!)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-alexa-read-my-email\">Alexa, read my email</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ can now supposedly understand documents you upload in the Alexa app or forward to her at alexa@alexa.com using the email address associated with your Amazon account.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To try this, I forwarded an email from my child’s school. These come frequently and have a lot of useful information in them, but are often lost in the inbox. Perhaps if Alexa can handle this task, a new Gmail forwarding filter is in order?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Alexa, summarize the recent email from school.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: The recent email from [my child’s school] is a welcome-back letter for the 2025-2026 school year. It announces</em> <em>an “Early Start Day” orientation on August [date] for new students, with an information session for new parents that evening. Regular classes begin on August [date].</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Was there any information specifically for [grade] in that email?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: I don’t see any information specifically for [grade] in that email. The letter mainly covers general school information, orientation dates, and important deadlines for all students.</em></p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034659\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=768,577 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=680,511 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=1200,901 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=1280,961 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=720,541 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=900,676 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=800,601 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=668,502 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=499,375 499w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=822,617 822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2035.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Alexa app screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Great, that worked, it seems. But here’s where things got a little trickier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Are there any important dates I should add to my calendar?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: *repeats the important dates from above*</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Can you add those to my calendar for me?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: (Which must have misheard me?) Checking your calendar. Sarah, your calendar is looking busy. You have [activity] ongoing until August 16th, you have [activity]. On Thursday</em>—</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: (interrupting) I was asking if you could add the dates in the email to my calendar for me?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: Certainly, I’ll do that. (Pause) I’ve added the following dates to your calendar:</em></p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><em>Course Correction Request Period from August [date] through August [date]</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><em>New Student Orientation Early Start Day on August [date, time]</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><em>First Day of School on August [date]</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Is there anything else you’d like me to add?</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this process seems efficient and is certainly helpful in a pinch, you’ll notice I left it up to Alexa to determine which dates were “important.” As a result, she picked the three dates closest to today. The email itself, however, contained a list of 12 important school dates, including things like Meet the Teacher Night, Open House, Midyear Graduation, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of them were formatted the same way in the email under the heading “Important Dates.” Had I only relied on Alexa and had not read the email itself, I would have missed these.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oh, dear.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-alexa-help-me-save-money\">Alexa, help me save money</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another Alexa+ promise is that she can help you track prices on Amazon so you can save money when things go on sale. All right, I’ll bite! I like online shopping.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> I decided to try tracking a couple of things, including one skin care item and a Coach handbag. These are things I definitely don’t need, but want — the kinds of things where a discount could prompt a purchase.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034660\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg 2158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=1200,683 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=1280,728 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=720,410 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=900,512 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=800,455 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=668,380 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=659,375 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=1084,617 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=708,403 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-11.58.22AM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Amazon.com screenshot.</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Me: Alexa, I want to know when the Glow Recipe Plum Plumping and Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Skin Care Serum goes on sale.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Alexa: Just a second … I’ve set up a deal tracker for the Glow Recipe Plum Plumping Serum.
