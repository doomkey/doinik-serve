In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/bending-spoons-to-acquire-aol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquisition of AOL</a> and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/what-is-bending-spoons-everything-to-know-about-aols-acquirer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$11 billion</a>, up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Dumont,<strong> </strong>the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/ZLRLCzq8n8Hwl0OycKsOC9mENB?domain=tiny.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tiny</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/P_YLCKAo6ofMgjZYckS6C5Qqog?domain=saas.group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SaaS.group</a>, <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/sFSTCA8LmLhlyvGPsQtyCGW8vh?domain=arisingventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arising Ventures</a>, and <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/qTZzCB1MnMHRQgzks1u9C2N0yT?domain=calmcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Calm Capital</a>, according to Dumont.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/18/uservoice-which-powers-customer-engagement-tools-for-meebo-hootsuite-more-raises-1-million/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$9 million</a> in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it. These funds get old, and these companies just sit there,” Dumont said. “We provide liquidity and also reset these companies for profitability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Dumont didn’t disclose how much he paid for UserVoice, he said that stagnant companies sell for a fraction of the valuation commanded by healthy SaaS startups, which typically sell for 4x annual revenue or more<strong>.</strong> Based on our conversation, we estimate that “venture zombies” sometimes sell for as low as 1x yearly revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By implementing cost-cutting and price increases, Curious can push these businesses to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins almost immediately. “If you have a million-dollar business, you’re kicking off $300,000 in earnings,” he offered as an example. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They achieve the turnarounds because, unlike the standalone companies, they can centralize functions like sales, marketing, finance, and other admin roles, across all of their portfolio companies. “We’re not trying to sell the businesses we acquire and don’t need VC-scale exits, so we can balance growth and profitability more sustainably,” Dumont said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why VCs don’t urge their startups to be profitable like Curious does, Dumont responded by saying: “Investors don’t care about earnings, they only care about growth. Without it, there’s no VC-scale exit, so there’s no incentive to operate with that level of profitability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cash generated from Curious’s companies is then used to buy other startups, Dumont said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm plans to buy 50 to 75 startups like UserVoice over the next five years, and Dumont is certain he won’t have a shortage of targets to choose from. Curious is focused on acquiring startups that generate $1 to $5 million in recurring revenue annually, a segment of the software market that, according to Dumont, private equity shops and secondary investors have historically ignored.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve been doing this for a little under two years now, and we’ve probably looked at at least 500 companies, and we bought five,” Dumont said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bending Spoons’ big valuation hike may validate the “venture zombie” acquisition model, Dumont doesn’t expect a lot of new competition. Turning profits out of stagnation isn’t easy. “It’s a ton of work,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “<a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167/youtube-test-features-and-experiments?sjid=82014890340299316-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Your Custom Feed</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1j2m5ul/does_youtubes_algorithm_completely_ignore_what_we/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/threads-is-developing-a-tool-that-lets-you-tag-its-algorithm-to-configure-your-feed/\">Threads</a> was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature. X is also working on a feature that would allow users to tag its AI chatbot, Grok, to adjust their feed.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">lawsuits</a> have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interactive fiction has seen a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/16/interactive-fiction-game-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">surge in popularity</a> over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">overly dependent</a> on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the Character.AI subreddit, reactions are mixed. According to their comments, some teens say that while they’re disappointed, they think it’s ultimately the right move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m so mad about the ban but also so happy because now I can do other things and my addiction might be over finally,” one user who identified themselves as a teenager wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another said, “as someone who is under 18 this is just disappointing. but also rightfully so bc people over here my age get addicted to this.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It remains to be seen how teens will use the Stories feature, but the format is less psychologically dubious than roleplaying with chatbots. Unlike Stories, chatbots directly interact with users in open-ended conversations and can send unprompted messages even when users aren’t actively using the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Character.AI’s decision to age-gate chatbot access comes at a time when California recently became the first state to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots/\">regulate</a> AI companions. Meanwhile, Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have <a href=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-bipartisan-bill-protecting-children-from-ai-chatbots-with-parents-colleagues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced a national bill</a> that would ban AI companions for minors altogether.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really hope us leading the way sets a standard in the industry that for under 18s, open-ended chats are probably not the path or the product to offer,” Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/character-ai-is-killing-the-chatbot-experience-for-minors/\">told TechCrunch</a> last month.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

OpenAI <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1993381101369458763\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company says you can talk and watch your answers appear as ChatGPT responds to your questions. You can also review your earlier messages and view visuals during your conversations, like images or maps, in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change will make it more natural to interact with the AI chatbot, as you can more easily move between speech and text in the same conversation; however, you’ll still need to tap “end” to stop the voice conversation when you’re ready to switch back to text. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This revamped voice mode is the new default and is rolling out now to all users across web and mobile apps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those who prefer the separate voice mode, OpenAI says they can still revert to the original experience under “Voice Mode” in “Settings.” Here, they’ll see a new option to turn on “Separate mode.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

That makes them really only as good as the first few results that come back from those indexes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daydream CEO and longtime e-commerce executive Julie Bornstein agrees — she <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/julie-bornsteins-daydream-is-releasing-an-ai-powered-chatbot-for-fashion-related-shopping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">remarked to TechCrunch over the summer</a> that she always viewed search as “the forgotten child” of the fashion industry, since it never worked particularly well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fashion … is uniquely nuanced and emotional — finding a dress you love is not the same as finding a television,” Bornstein told TechCrunch on Tuesday. “That level of understanding for fashion shopping comes from domain-specific data and merchandising logic that grasps silhouettes, fabrics, occasions, and how people build outfits over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI shopping startups develop their own datasets so that their tools are trained on higher-quality data — something that’s easier to achieve when you’re attempting to catalog fashion or furniture, rather than the sum of all human knowledge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Hudson’s case, Onton developed a data pipeline to catalog hundreds of thousands of interior design products in a cleaner manner, helping to train its internal models with better data. But if AI shopping startups don’t pursue that level of specialization, Hudson thinks they’re bound to be overshadowed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re using only off-the-shelf LLMs and a conversational interface, it’s very hard to see how a startup can compete with the larger companies,” Hudson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The advantage for OpenAI and Perplexity, however, is that their customers are already using their tools — plus, their large presence lets them ink deals with major retailers from the get-go. While Daydream and Phia redirect customers to retailers’ websites to complete their purchases — sometimes earning affiliate revenue — OpenAI and Perplexity have partnerships with Shopify and PayPal, respectively, allowing users to check out within the conversational interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies, which depend on mammoth amounts of expensive compute power to operate, are still trying to figure out a path to profitability. If they take inspiration from Google and Amazon, then it makes sense to look toward e-commerce as an option — retailers could pay them to advertise their products within search results. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But eventually, that could just exacerbate the existing issues that customers have with search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Vertical models — whether in fashion, travel, or home goods — will outperform because they’re tuned to real consumer decision-making,” Bornstein said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Additional reporting by Ivan Mehta.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The platform highlights alternative professions not usually emphasized in schools, including being a pop-punk band member, content creator, social media manager, and even a professional esports player.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced on Tuesday a $5 million Series A funding round, bringing its total funding to $8 million. The round was led by Echo Investment Capital, with support from Gross’ investment firm, Gross Labs. The investment will help expand the company’s “career readiness” programs across the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gross began his music career at 17 when his high school band, Open Air Stereo, gained significant exposure after being featured on MTV’s hit reality series “Laguna Beach.” Inspired by his experience, Gross came up with the idea for Find Your Grind after bringing students into his studio and seeing firsthand the challenges they face when exploring career options, often due to a lack of exposure in traditional schools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Young people are entering a rapidly changing world of work,” Gross told TechCrunch. “As students prepare to leave school and enter into their professional careers, many are doing so without a strong sense of who they are, what they want, or how to navigate their next steps after school. Find Your Grind gives them the tools to explore not just what careers are out there, but what paths suit their strengths, interests, and visions for what they want their futures to look like,” he said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070620\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=720,403 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=900,504 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=800,448 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=1102,617 1102w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=708,396 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Find Your Grind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conventional career guidance often focuses on salaries and promotions, but this can feel disconnected from the rapidly evolving job market that the new generation is entering. Many of these students no longer aspire to become doctors, engineers, or lawyers. In fact, <a href=\"https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_Report_2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the World Economic Forum</a> predicts that approximately 92 million jobs won’t exist in 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional career exploration also tends to overlook the emotional aspect of choosing a career that aligns with a person’s values and desired lifestyle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s platform focuses on four key competencies: self-awareness, career awareness, social awareness, and action awareness. It also features a Lifestyle Assessment that helps students identify three lifestyle paths based on their preferences. For example, they might discover that they align with the roles of an entertainer, a creator, or a humanitarian. Students then get a tailored next-step plan for what to do after graduation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, students can access videos and interactive lessons, and a group of mentors provides practical advice about their own career beginnings and the steps they took to achieve success. Notable mentors include Tony Hawk, Tony Hoffman, and will.i.am, among others.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also an AI-powered “Reflective Coach” that provides personalized feedback and encourages students to dive deeper into their answers for better insights.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070619\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Find Your Grind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Find Your Grind also runs workforce development initiatives, such as lifestyle fairs, that give students real-world experience. The company is rolling out its first program in Oklahoma City, working with local schools and training centers to help students discover job opportunities in their hometowns that align with their lifestyle preferences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to launch more programs in additional cities in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Find Your Grind has helped 100,000 students, according to the company. Gross told us he hopes that “over a million students” join the platform to be “more future-ready.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=18002428478&amp;text=Link+my+WhatsApp+with+ChatGPT&amp;type=phone_number&amp;app_absent=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=18334363285&amp;text&amp;type=phone_number&amp;app_absent=0&amp;wame_ctl=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Perplexity</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI had already <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-whatsapp-transition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated.

Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, <a href=\"https://ir.pony.ai/news-releases/news-release-details/pony-ai-inc-realized-gen-7-robotaxi-city-wide-ue-breakeven-set\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the company said</a> in its third-quarter earnings report.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pony.ai, which is publicly traded on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/self-driving-car-companies-pony-ai-and-weride-get-the-ok-for-hong-kong-listing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nasdaq Exchange and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong</a>, has spent the year ramping up its commercial operations. Today, the company offers commercial robotaxi services — meaning it charges for these rides — in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also has aspirations to scale beyond the borders of China. Pony.ai is pushing into eight countries, including Qatar and Singapore, through partnerships with local companies as well as ride-hailing companies Bolt and Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ramp-up in robotaxi services has had the dual effect of increasing revenue along with costs. The company reported revenue of $25.4 million in the third quarter, a 72% increase from the $14.8 million it generated in the same year-ago period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shares of Pony.ai popped on the Nasdaq more than 6% following its earnings report. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pony.ai said the rise in revenue was driven by robotaxi services and licensing its technology to other companies. The Guangzhou, China-based company brought in $6.7 million in revenue from robotaxi services, $10.2 million from its self-driving trucks called robotrucks, and $8.6 million in licensing and application fees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s expenses are still outpacing revenue. Pony.ai reported a net loss of $61.6 million in the third quarter, a 46% increase since the same period in 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pony.ai had $587.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, an amount that has decreased from $747.7 million in the second quarter of the year. Pony.ai said half of that decrease was from a one-off cash outflow that included investment into its joint venture with Toyota to support the production and deployment of its Gen-7 vehicle. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said that it is adding optimization for popular sites gradually.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070536\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg 1844w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=1200,599 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=1280,639 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=720,359 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=900,449 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=800,399 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=668,333 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=1237,617 1237w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=708,353 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Voice-Typing-Email.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Speechify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of accuracy, the word error rate was higher than some other tools like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/as-its-voice-dectation-app-takes-off-wispr-secures-25m-from-notable-capital/\">Wispr Flow</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/willows-voice-keyboard-lets-you-type-across-all-your-ios-apps-and-actually-edit-what-you-said/\">Willow</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.monologue.to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Monologue</a>. Speechify noted that its model learns faster as you use it more, and the error rate will gradually decrease.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also launching a conversational voice assistant that lives in the sidebar of your browser. You can ask it questions about the website, such as “what are the three key ideas?” or “explain this in simpler terms.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Speechify Voice AI Assistant Demo\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kL3XTaTFHE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While ChatGPT and Gemini have conversational modes, Speechify’s argument is that they are treated as an afterthought in their apps, and the startup’s own tool has voice as front and center. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe that chat will always be the default user experience in ChatGPT and Gemini when you open the apps. That’s what their users expect. Voice will always be secondary – and in many cases, an afterthought for ChatGPT and Gemini. We know from several years of building Speechify that there’s a large portion of the market, which includes our users, who want voice as the primary, default setting every time they open an app and talk to AI,” Rohan Pavuluri, the company’s chief business officer, told TechCrunch over email.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One notable hiccup with this is that Speechify’s assistant doesn’t currently work with browsers with in-built sidebar assistants like OpenAI’s Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, and Dia. The startup is not too worried about that as the extension is largely intended for Chrome and its massive user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speechify said that it plans to include both voice typing and a voice assistant in all its apps across desktop and mobile gradually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also wants to develop agents that complete tasks on your behalf. The startup didn’t reveal its full roadmap, but gave one example: making calls for you to make an appointment or wait on hold with customer support of a company.

It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections, or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies, from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China. Yet despite powering some of India’s most valuable tech businesses, most gig workers operate outside traditional labor protections and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/india-gig-workers-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lack access to basic social security</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newly implemented labor laws are intended to change that, by defining gig and platform workers in statute and requiring aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1-2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund. But the details remain murky: What exact benefits will actually be offered, how workers will access them, and how contributions will be tracked across multiple platforms, and when payouts will begin all remain unclear, raising concerns that meaningful protections may take years to materialize.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg\" alt=\"India’s Zomato to deliver food in 10 minutes in a global first\" class=\"wp-image-1927758\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 4500px) 100vw, 4500px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A Zomato delivery boy moves through New Delhi</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nasir Kachroo/NurPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/ss_code_gazette.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Code on Social Security</a> creates a legal framework for gig workers to be covered under schemes such as the Employees’ State Insurance, provident fund, and government-backed insurance. However, the extent of these benefits — including eligibility, contribution levels, and delivery mechanisms — remains unclear and will depend on future rules and scheme notifications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key part of the framework is the creation of Social Security Boards at both the central and state levels, tasked with designing and overseeing welfare schemes for gig and platform workers. The central board must include five representatives of gig and platform workers and five representatives of aggregators, all nominated by the government, alongside senior officials, experts, and state representatives, per the Code. But there is little clarity on how decisions will be made, how much influence worker representatives will actually have, or who will ultimately control decisions on funding and benefit delivery.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to wait and see what exactly is in the government’s mind when it comes to implementing the four Codes, and what it hopes to do for gig workers,” said Balaji Parthasarathy, a professor at IIIT Bangalore and principal investigator of the Fairwork India project. “And then we also have to see what the states translate on the ground.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parthasarathy noted that because labor policy in India is shared between the federal and state governments — listed  in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_List\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“concurrent list”</a> of the Indian Constitution — state governments are responsible for designing, notifying, and administering many of the schemes needed to make the Code on Social Security operational for gig workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That raises the possibility of uneven access, as some states move quickly to establish social security boards and roll out mechanisms, while others delay or deprioritize the effort due to political or fiscal constraints. Recent examples — such as Rajasthan’s <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-years-on-telangana-gig-workers-bill-catches-rajasthans-landmark-law-napping/articleshow/120880033.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stalled legislation after it was passed in 2023</a>, and Karnataka’s Gig Workers Act, which was implemented soon after <a href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/karnataka-notifies-law-to-secure-gig-workers-rights/article70045464.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">clearing the state assembly</a> — underscore how workers’ protections may ultimately depend on where they live rather than the law itself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Platform companies have publicly welcomed the reform, but are still largely evaluating what it will require of them. An Amazon India spokesperson told TechCrunch the company supports the Indian government’s intent behind the labor overhaul and is evaluating the changes it will need to introduce. A spokesperson for Zepto said the company welcomes the new labor codes as “a big step toward clearer, simpler rules that protect workers while supporting ease of doing business,” adding that the changes will help strengthen social security for its delivery partners without undermining the flexibility that quick-commerce operations rely on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Food delivery firm Eternal, formerly known as Zomato, said in a <a href=\"https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/cbf0e612-5f7f-4489-94c1-f69c895e1f1c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stock exchange filing</a> that the Social Security Code is a step toward more uniform rules and that it does not expect the financial impact to threaten its long-term business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, Aprajita Rana, a partner at corporate law firm AZB &amp; Partners, said the change “will naturally have a financial impact” on India’s e-commerce sector, as worker contributions are now being formalized. It will also create new compliance obligations, requiring companies to ensure all workers in their networks are registered with the government-managed fund, determine whether individuals are associated with multiple aggregators and how to avoid duplicative benefits, and set up internal grievance mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While the law has the right intent, gig worker structures in India are quite novel, and practical challenges in compliance will emerge as the law takes force,” Rana told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the biggest hurdles for gig workers seeking benefits under the newly implemented law will be registering on the Indian government’s <a href=\"https://eshram.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">E-Shram portal</a>, launched in 2021 as a national database of unorganized workers. The portal had <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=155119&amp;ModuleId=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">registered more than 300,000 platform workers</a> as of the end of August, even though the government estimates India’s gig workforce at around 10 million. Trade unions, including the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), which has more than 70,000 members, are working to help gig workers enroll so they can access the benefits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ambika Tandon, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge and an affiliate of the national trade union Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said registering on the portal could mean lost wages for gig workers, since they would have to take time off to fill in required details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These workers work for 16 hours a day,” she told TechCrunch. “They don’t have time to go and register themselves on the government portal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CITU is also among the 10 major Indian trade unions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/india-trade-unions-condemn-new-labour-codes-plan-nationwide-protests-2025-11-22/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">calling for the withdrawal</a> of the new labor laws, ahead of nationwide protests planned for Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits of registering on the E-Shram portal are not compelling for many gig workers, Tandon noted, because the law does not address more immediate concerns such as fluctuating earnings, account suspensions, and sudden termination of accounts — issues that workers say matter far more right now than access to insurance or provident fund benefits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trade unions often organize strikes to push platforms to address these concerns directly. However, such actions can disrupt everyone involved, including consumers, and put workers at further risk, as they are not paid while striking and may even face termination for participating.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg\" alt=\"Swiggy strike\" class=\"wp-image-2468998\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Swiggy workers protested in Kolkata in 2023</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>NurPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While the social security rules have now been put in place, we demand a minimum wage and an employer-employee relationship for gig and platform workers, which are yet to be set by the government,” said Shaik Salauddin, founder president of the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU), which has more than 10,000 members in the southern state of Telangana, and national general secretary of IFAT. “We urge the government to obtain data from aggregators and secure their monetary contributions to the fund to start offering benefits to workers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a broader debate over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/the-battle-over-gig-worker-status-is-heating-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">whether gig workers should be treated as employees</a> — a question the new labor laws do not address.

In some U.S. jurisdictions, regulators and courts have pushed for platform workers to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53737398\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">treated as employees</a> or similarly protected workers, though many ride-hail and delivery drivers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/25/california-uber-lyft-gig-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remain classified as independent contractors</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With this law, the Indian government has settled this debate by saying that these gig workers do not sit within the ambit of employment or other protections,” Tandon said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian labor ministry did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,” Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is an appealing market with the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone base after China and its deep engineering talent. Still, it’s also a country that lacks frontier model development and hasn’t produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">many companies pushing the technical frontier of AI</a>, where development remains concentrated in the U.S. and China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic</a> have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market — if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside capital, founders will receive up to $350,000 in compute credits across Google Cloud, Gemini, and DeepMind, as well as early access to Gemini and DeepMind models, APIs, and experimental features. The program will include support from Google Labs and DeepMind research teams, co-development opportunities, monthly mentorship with Accel partners and Google technical leads, and immersion sessions in London and the Bay Area, including Google I/O. Founders will also get marketing support through Accel and Google’s global channels, as well as access to the Atoms founder network and Google’s AI builder ecosystem, the companies said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“India has an incredible history of innovation, and we firmly believe that its founders are going to be playing a leading role in the next generation of AI-led global technology,” Jonathan Silber, co-founder and director of the Google AI Futures Fund, told TechCrunch. “This is the Futures Fund’s first such collaboration anywhere in the world, and we chose India for a reason. Google has been a committed partner in the country’s journey to digital transformation, with multibillion-dollar investments over the years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership follows Google’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$15 billion plan</a> to build a 1-gigawatt data center and AI hub in India. The company also announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$10 billion digitization fund</a> in 2020, which has backed firms including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/27/google-airtel-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bharti Airtel</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reliance Jio</a>, and Walmart-owned <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/24/google-invests-350-million-in-indias-flipkart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Flipkart</a>.

It has backed companies including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/replit-hits-3b-valuation-on-150m-annualized-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Replit</a> and <a href=\"https://legaltechnology.com/2025/05/13/google-launches-new-ai-futures-fund-and-harvey-is-among-the-inaugural-cohort/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Harvey</a>, and has also invested directly in Indian startups such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/google-back-toonsutra-to-grow-its-webtoons-platform-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Toonsutra</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/google-bets-on-stan-an-indian-social-gaming-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">STAN</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silber told TechCrunch that Google would appear on the cap tables of startups funded through the partnership and would be “a material presence,” but declined to share how its equity stakes would compare with Accel’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is our attempt to work with the market leader in the space who knows the country incredibly well, that can get us talking to earlier-stage founders at an early informative stage, that can move the needle,” Silber said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While using Google products is, perhaps, a given for applicants to this program, both Silber and Swaroop told TechCrunch there would be no requirements for startups to exclusively use Gemini or any other Google product. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Sometimes, Google’s technology is the best. Other times, you’ll see Anthropic or OpenAI. So, we’re not putting firm requirements that say you can only use Google’s models,” said Silber. “What we’re hoping to do, though, is find a couple of different unique integrations that we can do with these companies that leverage Google AI technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in 2021, Accel’s pre-seed and seed platform, Atoms, has backed more than 40 companies that have collectively raised over $300 million in follow-on funding. The firm <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/ai-story/accel-ai-atoms-x-pledges-up-to-1m-indian-founders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded the program this year</a> to include Indian-origin founders based overseas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest collaboration comes days after Accel’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/26/accel-and-prosus-team-up-to-back-early-stage-indian-startups-building-for-1-4b-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnership with Prosus</a> to co-invest in Atoms X, backing early-stage Indian founders building large-scale solutions with the potential to serve the masses in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silber told TechCrunch that Google is not structuring the partnership as a pathway to future acquisitions, or even future cloud customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not a sales team, so we’re not specifically looking to sign up new cloud customers. That’s not our goal,” he said. “In terms of KPIs, our objective is simply to see the next wave of innovation in the AI space coming out of India.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/05/openai-and-jony-ive-may-be-struggling-to-figure-out-their-ai-device/\">rumored to be “screenless</a>” and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/openai-taps-apple-supplier-make-ai-device-information-reports-2025-09-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pocket-sized</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io</a>, to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual <a href=\"https://www.emersoncollective.com/events/demo-day/demo-day-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Demo Day</a> in San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device he described should be able to filter things out for the user, as the user would trust the AI to do things for them over long periods of time. It should also be contextually aware of when it’s the best time to present information to the user and ask for input. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You trust it over time, and it does have just this incredible contextual awareness of your whole life,” Altman added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ive confirmed at the event that the device should be available in under two years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I love solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity,” Ive told Powell Jobs in the interview. “And I also love incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch, and you feel no intimidation, and you want to use almost carelessly — that you use them almost without thought — that they’re just tools,” he said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"In conversation: OpenAI's Sam Altman and LoveFrom's Jony Ive with Laurene Powell Jobs | #ECDemoDay\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bkCe6gpNutU?start=1&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The CPSC has linked the batteries to 31 reports of fire so far. Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/rad-power-bikes-faces-shutdown-in-january-without-new-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told employees earlier this month</a> the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power told TechCrunch it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it “offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns,” including upgrading customers to its latest batteries, which are not subject to the official warning. “CPSC rejected this opportunity. The significant cost of the all-or-nothing demand would force Rad to shut its doors immediately, leaving no way to support our riders or our employees.” (The Verge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/828004/rad-power-bikes-batteries-fire-cpsc?utm_content=buffercb185&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported</a> Rad Power’s disagreement with the CPSC.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power claimed its batteries comply with “the highest industry standards” and said the “incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While that number is low, we know even one incident is one too many, and we are heartbroken by any report involving our products,” the company told TechCrunch in an email. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owners can find out if they have batteries covered by the warning on the CPSC warning <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Warnings/2026/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-to-Immediately-Stop-Using-Batteries-for-E-Bikes-from-Rad-Power-Bikes-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-Risk-of-Serious-Injury-or-Death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">page</a>. The commission is telling customers not to throw the lithium-ion batteries away, nor take them to traditional recyclers. Instead, they should take the batteries to “municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center[s].”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The organization handles the licensing and registration of vehicles in the Netherlands and is seen as a critical step for Tesla to get approval for — and eventually roll out — FSD to consumers across Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026. Please contact them via link below to express your excitement &amp; thank them for making this happen as soon as possible,” Tesla wrote in the post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems RDW isn’t quite in line with Tesla. The Dutch regulator clarified in a <a href=\"https://www.rdw.nl/nieuws/2025/reactie-rdw-naar-aanleiding-van-oproep-tesla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement on their website</a> that Tesla plans to demonstrate FSD Supervised in February.

Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period. For the RDW, (traffic) safety is paramount,” the statement reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $8,000 fee, owners can upgrade to FSD Supervised, which provides additional automated driving features, including steering and lane changes on highways and surface streets. FSD is not self-driving and requires the driver to remain engaged with their hands on the wheel at all times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FSD is available in Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, and the United States.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “<em>An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own</em>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://stickerbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Stickerbox</a>, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070381\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg 3502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=322,430 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-testing-the-ai-sticker-printer\">Testing the AI sticker printer</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070370\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg 4159w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Stickerbox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using Stickerbox is simple. You push the button, describe an image out loud, then release the button to see your text appear on screen, followed by an AI-generated image as the printer spits out a physical copy. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a serendipity to an experience in which you’re thinking of an idea and then holding it in your hand in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device’s thermal image printer requires no ink, and the paper is <a href=\"https://www.ecocenter.org/about-bpa-and-bps-receipt-paper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BPS and BPA</a>-free, making it safe to use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The printed sticker is easy to tear off and then can be colored in with the colored pencils that come with the device. Your own crayons and markers also work. This combines the somewhat dopamine-driven experience of thinking up new things to print with the more calming or meditative aspects that come with coloring, similar to giving kids a coloring book.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ended up offering a healthy balance between using potentially addictive tech and then slowing down to engage in a real-world activity. It also helped to address potential boredom. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?w=676\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070382\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg 4280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=768,772 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1193,1200 1193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1273,1280 1273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=428,430 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=716,720 716w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=895,900 895w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=796,800 796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1527,1536 1527w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=2037,2048 2037w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=664,668 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=373,375 373w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=614,617 614w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=528,531 528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more you use Stickerbox, the more you realize how complex your prompts can be.

(The company sold to GOAT Group in 2022.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before Grailed, Gupta founded and launched the Y Combinator-backed hardware <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/28/wakemate-2-0-helping-you-kiss-those-groggy-mornings-goodbye-for-real-this-time/\">sleep tracker WakeMate</a>. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?w=617\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070368\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg 3787w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=136,150 136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=272,300 272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=768,847 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=617,680 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=1088,1200 1088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=1160,1280 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=390,430 390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=653,720 653w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=816,900 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=725,800 725w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=1393,1536 1393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=1857,2048 1857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=606,668 606w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=340,375 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=559,617 559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=481,531 481w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bob-and-Arun_2.jpg?resize=45,50 45w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Stickerbox co-founders Arun Gupta (CEO) and Bob Whitney (CTO)</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Stickerbox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whitney, meanwhile, had worked as the director of engineering at The New York Times’ Games division, as the publisher pivoted from offering just crosswords to becoming a full-fledged gaming app, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/31/popular-puzzle-game-wordle-is-being-purchased-by-the-new-york-times/\">acquiring Wordle</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/nyt-games-redesigned-app-boost-discovery-simplify-navigation/\">launching</a> other games like Connections and Strads. While that experience taught him a lot about what makes a great consumer-facing product, his later stint at Anthropic gave him a firsthand look at the advances in AI technology.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it was his experience as a father that inspired Stickerbox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When his son asked for a coloring page he didn’t have on hand, he turned to ChatGPT to make a printable image. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I made it for him — a tiger eating ice cream. And he had never seen a printer before. I got out from under the bed our HP printer — literally dusted it off and printed it for him, and he ran off happily and started coloring it,” explained Whitney. “But, a minute later, the gears were turning, and he came back to me, and he was like, ‘I want a lizard riding a skateboard.’ And I was like, okay, cool, let me make that for you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His son was so thrilled with the process of being able to say something and see it come to life that he realized there could be something to this. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I just saw this look on his face of magic — like pure magic,” noted Whitney. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The co-founders were also thinking about how AI technology offered so many novel experiences, but most weren’t made for kids. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody’s building AI specifically for kids. So that’s what we’re looking for,” said Gupta. “What are the right guardrails? What are the right ways? What are the right products?” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?w=453\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070376\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png 832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=800,1200 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=287,430 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=480,720 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=600,900 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=533,800 533w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=445,668 445w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=250,375 250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=411,617 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=354,531 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They realized that kids have great imaginations, ideal for working with an AI image model. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[They have] endless imagination and creativity … they’re learning new things every day. Every week, they’ve got a new obsession. We’re literally the first people in the world, I think, to put an image model inside of a box,” Gupta said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-built-for-updates\">Built for updates</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the hood, Stickerbox actually uses a combination of AI models, including its own proprietary tech focused on making the device kid-safe. It won’t respond to requests for harmful content, like violence or sexual imagery, and it filters out swear words. And if you try a somewhat more innocuous command, like “boobs,” it just prints a random sticker that may be vaguely related to the word. (For instance, you might get a generic cartoon girl, but not a large-chested one.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After trying and failing to get a naughty result, most kids will likely go back to just prompting the device for silly images instead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to be the trusted brand for parents where you don’t have to look over your kid’s shoulder and be like, ‘what are they doing? How are they using this?,” said Gupta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the company generates some revenue from the device sales, but it keeps the cost of restocking paper low. It’s just $5.99 for three rolls, which equates to 180 stickers. (It’s currently running a promotion that offers six rolls with every purchase now.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, the team plans to explore adding premium features, including a way to upload your own image to imagine yourself in fantastic scenarios or collaboration tools.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Meet Stickerbox: Creativity That Sticks\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxN-MqM_RKI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a Wi-Fi-connected device, Stickerbox is regularly updated with new firmware and features. In tests, for instance, we were able to print some recognizable characters, but a more recent update added new guardrails to guide kids toward more original designs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A soon-to-launch companion app also lets you view past creations and save favorites, and could ultimately serve as the home for premium features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stickerbox is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jerrylu/status/1990808053818470704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">backed by $7 million</a> in funding from <a href=\"https://www.maveron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Maveron</a>, Serena Williams’ <a href=\"https://www.serenaventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Serena Ventures</a>, the Allen Institute’s <a href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI2 incubator</a>, and various angels, including Matt Brezina, and product leaders from other consumer apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI launched a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-u-s-government-agencies/\">version of ChatGPT designed exclusively for federal U.S. government agencies</a> in January.
