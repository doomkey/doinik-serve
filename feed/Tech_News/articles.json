Whether that function is drafting content for the marketing department, reviewing risks in documents for a firm’s legal team, or drafting responses for customer support, the plug-in is designed to use agentic automation to streamline work with a specialized focus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says you can use plug-ins to “tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose so your team gets more consistent outcomes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Matt Piccolella, who works on the product team at Anthropic, told TechCrunch that plug-ins are built to be customized and that the company expects enterprise users to create their very own bespoke use cases for them. Anthropic open sourced 11 of its in-house plug-ins as part of the release on Friday, but noted that custom plug-ins are “easy to build, edit, and share” and can be utilized without much technical expertise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plug-ins have already been <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">available within Claude Code</a> for some time, and their expansion into Cowork is merely designed to take that same utility and share it with different kinds of users. “Really, what we’re doing with this launch is just bringing them to Cowork and giving them that kind of user-friendly, UI-centric flavor that will allow the maximum number of people to use them,” Piccolella said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Piccolella pointed to data analysis and sales as two departments within Anthropic where plug-ins have already shown promise. “Sales has been a really big one, both for our direct sales people, but then also just getting anybody who’s kind of sales adjacent, better connected to the customer and customer feedback and all of that,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says that the more enterprise users utilize plug-ins, the more Claude knows about a company’s workflows and how to optimize them. Currently, plug-ins get saved locally to a user’s machine, although Anthropic says that an organization-wide sharing tool is on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cowork, which just released about two weeks ago, is currently in its research preview. It’s unclear when it will launch more widely. For the time being, plug-ins will be available to all paying Claude customers, Anthropic says.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Of those, 235 million posts contained media, accounting for 62% of all media posts shared on Bluesky to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also reported a fivefold increase in legal requests from law enforcement agencies, government regulators, and legal representatives in 2025, with 1,470 requests, up from 238 requests in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company previously shared moderation reports in <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2023</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-17-2025-moderation-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2024</a>, this is the first time it’s put together a comprehensive transparency report. The new report tackles other areas outside of moderation, like regulatory compliance and account verification information, among other things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-moderation-reports-from-users-jump-54\"><strong>Moderation reports from users jump 54%</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compared with 2024, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/bluesky-saw-17x-increase-in-moderation-reports-in-2024-after-rapid-growth/\">Bluesky saw a 17x increase</a> in moderation reports, the company this year reported a 54% increase, going from 6.48 million user reports in 2024 to 9.97 million in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the number jumped, Bluesky noted that the growth “closely tracked” its 57% user growth that occurred over the same period.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around 3% of the user base, or 1.24 million users, submitted reports in 2025, with the top categories being “misleading” (which includes spam) at 43.73% of the total, “harassment” at 19.93%, and sexual content at 13.54%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A catch-all “other” category included 22.14% of the reports that didn’t fall under these categories, or others like violence, child safety, breaking site rules, or self-harm, which accounted for much smaller percentages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the “misleading” category’s 4.36 million reports, spam accounted for 2.49 million reports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, hate speech accounted for the largest share of the 1.99 million “harassment” reports, with about 55,400 reports. Other areas that saw activity included targeted harassment (about 42,520 reports), trolling (29,500 reports), and doxxing (about 3,170 reports).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Bluesky said that the majority of “harassment” reports included those that fell into the gray area of antisocial behavior, which may include rude remarks, but didn’t fit into the other categories, like hate speech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most of the sexual content reports (1.52 million) concerned mislabeling, Bluesky says, meaning that adult content was not properly marked with metadata — tags that allow users to control their own moderation experience using Bluesky’s tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A smaller number of reports focused on nonconsensual intimate imagery (about 7,520), abuse content (about 6,120), and deepfakes (over 2,000).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reports focused on violence (24,670 in total) were broken down into subcategories like threats or incitement (about 10,170 reports), glorification of violence (6,630 reports), and extremist content (3,230 reports).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to user reports, Bluesky’s automated system flagged 2.54 million potential violations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One area where Bluesky reported success involved a decline in daily reports of antisocial behavior on the site, which dropped 79% after the implementation of a system that identified toxic replies and reduced their visibility by putting them behind an extra click, similar to what X does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky also saw a drop in user reports month-over-month, with reports per 1,000 monthly active users declining 50.9% from January to December.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png\" alt=\"a graph showing the number of reports, with most of the reports filed in the month of January 2025 featuring mostly violence, harassment, and other categories.\" class=\"wp-image-3088248\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png 1313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1200,720 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1280,768 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=720,432 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=900,540 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=800,480 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=668,401 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=625,375 625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1028,617 1028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=708,425 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of moderation, Bluesky noted it removed 3,619 accounts for suspected influence operations, most likely those operating from Russia. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-increases-in-takedowns-legal-requests\">Increases in takedowns, legal requests</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said last fall it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/bluesky-says-its-getting-more-aggressive-about-moderation-and-enforcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">getting more aggressive</a> about its moderation and enforcement, and that appears to be true.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Bluesky took down 2.44 million items in 2025, including accounts and content. The year prior, Bluesky had taken down 66,308 accounts, and its automated tooling took down 35,842 accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moderators also took down 6,334 records, and automated systems removed 282.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png\" alt=\"a screenshot showing a pie chart, showing a number of takedowns by Bluesky's policies.\" class=\"wp-image-3088245\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png 1836w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=768,764 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=680,676 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=1200,1193 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=1280,1273 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=430,428 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=720,716 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=900,895 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=800,796 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=1536,1528 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=668,664 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=377,375 377w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=620,617 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=534,531 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1836px) 100vw, 1836px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky also issued 3,192 temporary suspensions in 2025, and 14,659 permanent removals for ban evasion. Most of the permanent suspensions were focused on accounts engaging in inauthentic behavior, spam networks, and impersonation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, its report suggests that it prefers labeling content more than it does booting out users. Last year, Bluesky applied 16.49 million labels to content, up 200% year-over-year, while account takedown grew 104% from 1.02 million to 2.08 million. Most of the labeling involved adult and suggestive content or nudity.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We can’t shrink away and hope the crisis fades. Hope without action is not a strategy ––  it’s an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s been some pushback among the most powerful in the Valley against these deaths. Besides Hoffman, a longtime critic of Trump, billionaire <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/vinod-khosla-publicly-disavows-keith-rabois-comments-on-ice-shooting/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">VC Vinod Khosla has been the most vocal</a>, characterizing the White House and crew as “a conscious-less administration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have also expressed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/anthropic-and-openai-ceos-condemn-ice-violence-praise-trump/\">concern over the Border Patrol incidents</a>, with some doing so in leaked internal memos. But most of them were quick to distance their concerns over this issue from the president himself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the distinction that Hoffman wants to end. He’s making the case that tech leaders have power “and sitting on that power is not good for business. It’s also not neutrality. It’s a choice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, many of the largest tech companies depend on the federal government for business, including AI regulation, tariffs that affect the costs of their products, and massive, lucrative contracts to supply the U.S. government with technology. (OpenAI even got in a bit of hot water in November after its CFO said, and later walked back, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/sam-altman-says-he-doesnt-want-the-government-to-bail-out-openai-if-it-fails/\">that the company wanted the feds to backstop their loans</a>, essentially guaranteeing payment so the AI lab could get more favorable rates.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hoffman is echoing the sentiment of a growing contingent of tech workers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\">who have signed a petition</a> asking their CEOs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities, to cancel <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/\">all company contracts with ICE</a>, and to speak out publicly against ICE’s violence.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there certainly are tech leaders who remain vocal supporters of Trump, like Elon Musk and Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures, many leaders appear to be, at least publicly, walking the fence. Cook, for instance, wrote that he was “heartbroken” and urged “de-escalation” in his internal memo, but also <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/27/apple-tim-cook-trump-alex-pretti/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">attended</a> an exclusive screening of First Lady Melania Trump’s documentary hours after the ICE shooting of Alex Pretti, one of the Americans killed in the incidents. Hence Hoffman’s call to arms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to the report, the hackers didn’t face a lot of resistance. The targeted systems used default usernames and passwords and did not have multi-factor authentication enabled, both incredibly basic mistakes. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers tried to infect the systems they broke into with wiper malware designed to erase and effectively destroy the systems, perhaps trying to turn off the power, although it’s unclear if that was their goal. Either way, the attacks were stopped at the heat-and-power plant, but not at the wind and solar farms, whose systems to monitor and control grid systems were made inoperable by the malware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of the attacks were purely destructive in nature — by analogy to the physical world, they can be compared to deliberate acts of arson,” read the report. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers failed to disrupt power at any of their targeted facilities. And even if they had succeeded, the report said that the hack “would not have affected the stability of the Polish power system during the period in question.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cybersecurity firms <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-research-sandworm-cyberattack-poland-power-grid-late-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ESET</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dragos.com/blog/poland-power-grid-attack-electrum-targets-distributed-energy-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dragos</a> previously released reports about the attacks, which occurred on December 29 of last year, accusing the notorious Russian government hacking group Sandworm of being behind the intrusions. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sandworm</a> has a documented history of targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine and turning off the lights in the country in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cybersecurity-sandworm-idUSKBN0UM00N20160108/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2015</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2016</a>, and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/sandworm-disrupts-power-ukraine-operational-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2022</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poland’s CERT, however, accused a different Russian government hacking group, known as <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Berserk Bear or Dragonfly</a>, which is not known for destructive attacks, but rather more traditional cyberespionage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

As one of the year’s first major tech IPOs, the insurtech platform is being closely watched as a bellwether for the 2026 listing cycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company and its selling shareholders raised approximately $200 million in the offering, selling 10.5 million shares at $19 each under the ticker symbol “LIFE” — one of the more on-the-nose choices in recent memory. The name fits. Ethos runs a three-sided platform where consumers buy policies online in 10 minutes without medical exams. It says over 10,000 independent agents use its software to sell those policies and that carriers like Legal &amp; General America and John Hancock rely on it for underwriting and administrative services. Ethos itself isn’t an insurer — it’s a licensed agency earning commissions on sales.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the company’s stock closed its first day as a public company at $16.85, 11% below its IPO price of $19, Ethos co-founders Peter Colis and Lingke Wang still have plenty to celebrate, having grown the 10-year-old business to public-market scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we launched [the business], there were like eight or nine other life insurtech startups that looked very similar to Ethos, with similar Series A funding,” Colis told TechCrunch. “Over time, the vast majority of those startups have pivoted, been acquired at subscale, remain at subscale or gone out of business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Policygenius, which raised over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/02/insurtech-policygenius-cuts-25-of-staff-less-than-3-months-after-raising-125m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$250 million</a> from investors, including KKR and Norwest Venture Partners, was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/digital-insurance-market-policygenius-be-acquired-by-eldridges-zinnia-2023-04-25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquired by PE-backed Zinnia</a> in 2023. Meanwhile, Health IQ, a startup that secured more than $200 million from prominent VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2023/09/11/andreessen-horowitz-backed-startup-health-iq-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed for bankruptcy</a> that same year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ethos, which has raised over $400 million in venture capital, could have easily succumbed to a similar fate. Instead, the company remained laser-focused on reaching profitability as the era of cheap capital and easy fundraising came to an end in 2022. “Not knowing what the ongoing funding climate would be, we got really serious about ensuring profitability,” Colis said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That financial discipline transformed it into a profitable company by mid-2023, according to its <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788451/000119312525219975/d901135ds1.htm#rom901135_13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IPO documents</a>. Since then, Ethos has also maintained a year-over-year revenue growth rate of more than 50%. In the nine months ending September 30, 2025, the company generated almost $278 million in revenue and just under $46.6 million in net income.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the company ended its first day as a public company with a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion, a valuation that’s significantly below the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/ethos-picks-up-100m-at-a-2-7b-valuation-for-a-big-data-platform-to-improve-life-insurance-accessibility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$2.7 billion</a> it garnered in its last private round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 in July 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why Ethos went public, Colis said that a big part of the reason was to bring “additional trust and credibility” to potential partners and clients. He explained that because many major insurance carriers are over a century old, being publicly traded signals the company’s staying power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The largest outside shareholders of Ethos include prominent firms, including Sequoia, Accel, Google’s venture arm GV, and SoftBank, as well as General Catalyst and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel did not sell shares in the IPO, the company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788451/000119312526015943/d901135ds1a.htm#rom901135_18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company reports that its signature device had its best quarter ever, thanks partially to a surge of sales in regions like China and India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“iPhone had its best-ever quarter driven by unprecedented demand, with all-time records across every geographic segment,” said CEO Tim Cook during the company’s earnings call Thursday. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/fy2026-q1/FY26_Q1_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings report</a> shows the company sold $85 billion worth of iPhones during its first quarter, up from $69 billion in the same period last year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the call’s Q&amp;A portion, Cook revealed that China had seen a huge surge in sales. “It was driven by iPhone, where we set an all-time revenue record,” Cook said, noting that it was the “best iPhone quarter in history in Greater China.” Cook said the sales bump had been driven by enthusiasm for the iPhone 17, which was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/iphone-17-iphone-air-airpods-pro-3-and-everything-else-announced-at-apples-hardware-event/\">announced in September</a>. The new model has proven to be <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/01/iphone-17-pro-demand-surges-far-past-iphone-16-pro-launch-orders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significantly more popular</a> than the company’s previous iPhone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s earnings report shows that its overall sales in the Greater China region jumped from $18.5 billion in the year-ago quarter to $25.5 billion. Cook noted that, overall, the company had fared quite well in the region. “I would tell you that during the quarter, traffic in our stores in China grew by strong double digits year over year,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cook also highlighted India as another region where iPhones — as well as other products — seemed to be flying off the shelves. “We did set a quarterly revenue record during the December quarter,” Cook said, noting that records had been set for “iPhone and Mac and iPad [sales] and an all-time revenue record on services.” Cook called it “a terrific quarter” in a country that he noted is “the second largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth largest PC market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone aside, Apple’s overall sales jumped across every geographical region, its earnings report shows. In the Americas, for instance, sales went from $52.6 billion a year ago to $58.5 billion, while in Europe, they increased from $33.8 billion to $38.1 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As analysts peppered CEO Tim Cook with softball questions during Apple’s earnings call, one analyst dared to ask the question that seemingly no one in Silicon Valley is willing to ask.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I think about your AI initiatives, you know, it’s clear there are added costs associated with that… Many of your competitors have already integrated AI into their devices, and it’s just not clear yet what incremental monetization they’re seeing because of AI…,” started Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Could there be a tinge of nervousness underneath this Finance Man’s probably-very-financey facade? In what I can only imagine must have been a Herculean display of courage, Woodring asked the question that lurks only in the darkest, dampest recesses of investors’ minds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So, how do you monetize AI?” he asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You’d think this would come up more. You would be wrong. Instead, Big Tech has taken a largely vibes-driven approach to AI development. Take OpenAI, for instance, which may seem like it’s on top of the world, given how ChatGPT has embedded itself into the cultural consciousness. But the company <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-won-t-money-2030-182441351.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">isn’t planning to make any money</a> until 2030. Analysts from HBSC are even doubtful about that timeline, especially since it will need another $207 billion in funding, estimates say. Ask anyone in tech how OpenAI is planning to break even, and you’ll be met with the verbal equivalent of the ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ emoticon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But good ol’ Tim “$143.8 billion in revenue” Cook was having a good afternoon, so maybe he’d finally spill the beans about how any of these companies are planning to recoup their investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His answer was disappointing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Well, let me just say that we’re bringing intelligence to more of what people love, and we’re integrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way, and I think that by doing so, it creates great value, and that opens up a range of opportunities across our products and services,” Cook said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, there you have it, folks. Apple will monetize AI by creating “great value.” And, crucially, that will “open up a range of opportunities.” Which we will experience in “products and services.” Cool!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, shout-out to that Morgan Stanley guy for trying.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While the talks appear to be in the early stage, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, it could eventually lead to at least one company folding into SpaceX. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two scenarios are being hashed out. In one, SpaceX and Tesla would merge, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/elon-musk-s-spacex-is-said-to-consider-merger-with-tesla-or-xai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per Bloomberg</a>, citing unnamed insiders. In another, SpaceX and aXI (which already owns Musk’s social media platform X) would combine.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/musks-spacex-merger-talks-with-xai-ahead-planned-ipo-source-says-2026-01-29/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting by Reuters</a>, a merger between SpaceX and xAI could take place ahead of a planned SpaceX IPO this year. This would bring products like the Grok chatbot, X platform, Starlink satellites, and SpaceX rockets together under one corporation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Company representatives from SpaceX and xAI have not discussed this possibility in public. However, recent filings show that two new corporate entities were established in Nevada on January 21, which are called K2 Merger Sub Inc. and K2 Merger Sub 2 LLC. This suggests that Musk is keeping all options open.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are upsides to either scenario. Combining the SpaceX and xAI companies could allow xAI to put its data centers in space, something Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/elon-musk-says-teslas-restarted-dojo3-will-be-for-space-based-ai-compute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has said he wants</a>. A SpaceX-Tesla tie-up could align the EV maker’s energy storage business with the data center in space idea as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And both options — as well as a combination of all three companies — fall in line with Musk’s comments and recent actions to consolidate, or at the very least share resources between them. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, according to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/spacex-to-invest-2-billion-into-elon-musks-xai-413934de?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfJGajOyX0Jq6Oe7VY0pK_28EASB6Z_rVltqiEVHf09KirGkrAZ_vM4QJ2Y2Wg%3D&amp;gaa_ts=697bb6fc&amp;gaa_sig=jPWtwCwRQSOTId470Pop-Ss6xvPoSE8nKjZBP9e90_NelhVjLVNVL-Gb750oF1cEMhyx1EPYIM3SW7d621zGEg%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, and earlier this week, Tesla (also led by Musk) revealed it, too, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-invested-2b-in-elon-musks-xai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invested $2 billion</a> in the AI startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, xAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bought X</a> in a deal that Musk said valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion.

So that it can allow its employees to take the day off to protest, Stubblebine said Medium will coordinate with the necessary teams to ensure there’s a plan for “business continuity” on Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech leaders, including Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">outspoken in protest of ICE</a>.

The company released some impressive processing-speed specs for Maia, saying it outperforms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/\">Amazon’s latest Trainium</a> chips and Google’s latest Tensor Processing Units (TPU).  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of the cloud giants are turning to their own AI chip designs in part because of the difficulty, and expense, of obtaining the latest and greatest from Nvidia — a supply crunch that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/nvda-stock-earnings-ai-bubble-china.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shows no signs of abating.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even with its own state-of-the-art, high-performance chip in hand, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company will still be buying chips made by others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a great partnership with Nvidia, with AMD. They are innovating. We are innovating,” he explained. “I think a lot of folks just talk about who’s ahead. Just remember, you have to be ahead for all time to come.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added: “Because we can vertically integrate doesn’t mean we just only vertically integrate,” meaning building its own systems from top to bottom, without using wares from other vendors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Maia 200 will be used by Microsoft’s own so-called Superintelligence team, the AI specialists building the software giant’s own frontier models. That’s according to <a href=\"https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/2015825111769841744\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mustafa Suleyman</a>, the former Google DeepMind co-founder who now leads the team.

That earlier breach of SonicWall allowed hackers to obtain credentials needed to launch a ransomware attack against Marquis, the memo said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis said its third-party investigation determined that the hackers obtained information about its firewall during the breach at SonicWall, which Marquis claims was used to circumvent its firewall. Marquis confirmed in the communication that it stored a backup of its firewall configuration file in SonicWall’s cloud. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company was “evaluating its options” regarding its firewall provider, including the “recoupment of any expenses spent by Marquis and its customers in responding to the data incident,” according to the memo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, Hanna Grimm, an agency spokesperson representing Marquis, did not address or dispute the company’s recent communication to customers but reiterated the claim linking its breach with an earlier theft of its firewall configuration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In September 2025, after the data security incident affected our systems, our firewall service provider, an industry-leading cybersecurity company, publicly disclosed that a threat actor had earlier in the year gained unauthorized access to its cloud backup service,” the statement said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Marquis had recently begun using this provider’s firewalls to help protect our network,” the statement added. “While the provider initially reported that fewer than 5% of customers were affected, it later clarified in October 2025 that firewall configuration data and credentials associated with all customers using the cloud backup service, including Marquis, had been accessed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When contacted by TechCrunch, SonicWall spokesperson Bret Fitzgerald said that the company has asked Marquis for evidence to substantiate its claims and said it would continue to engage with its customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have no new evidence to establish a connection between the SonicWall security incident reported in September 2025 and ongoing global ransomware attacks on firewalls and other edge devices,” Fitzgerald said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Texas-based Marquis, which allows hundreds of banks and credit unions to visualize their customers’ data, began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/fintech-firm-marquis-alerts-dozens-of-us-banks-and-credit-unions-of-a-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">notifying hundreds of thousands of people last month</a> that their information was taken during its ransomware attack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has access to large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the U.S., including personal information, financial data, and Social Security numbers, which the hackers stole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SonicWall <a href=\"https://www.sonicwall.com/support/notices/mysonicwall-cloud-backup-file-incident/kA1VN0000000RoD0AU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">conceded in October</a> that an earlier breach of its systems had in fact affected all of its customers who backed up their firewall files to SonicWall’s cloud. It had previously said hackers <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/sonicwall_breach_hits_every_cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stole only a fraction of its customers’ firewall configuration files</a> containing policies and settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the communication seen by TechCrunch, Marquis said it called in a third party to investigate whether a patch it had failed to roll out at the time of the breach could have been to blame but concluded that the patch related to a flaw was not exploitable in a way that could have allowed hackers to access the company’s data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis’ spokesperson declined to provide a number of how many individuals are affected by its data breach. The number of individuals known to be affected by the breach is expected to rise as new data breach notifications are submitted to state attorneys general. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the Marquis data breach?

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says the answer to that question is yes  — and spent considerable time on the earnings call trying to make that point.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft has spent almost as much on capital expenditures in the first half of its current fiscal year as it did in all of the previous year. And the numbers truly are enormous: Microsoft <a href=\"https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/Document/DownloadDocument/132/FinancialStatementFY26Q2.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spent</a> $88.2 billion on capital expenditures last year and has spent $72.4 billion so far this year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of that spend is to serve AI to enterprises and major AI labs, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/microsoft-earnings-7-6-billion-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">especially OpenAI</a>, as well as Anthropic. The big question on investors’ minds is: Will the spending turn into more use and ultimately profits?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors are scared that Microsoft’s main enterprise cloud product, Azure, and its Microsoft 365 apps didn’t grow as fast as they wanted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fact that BOTH Azure and the M365 segments fell a bit short is the key negative we’re hearing,” Wall Street analyst for UBS, Karl Keirstead, wrote in his research note on Thursday. (Keirstead isn’t worried about it, though, and recommends buying the stock.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-has-a-problem-nobody-wants-to-buy-or-use-its-shoddy-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">news reports circulated</a> that people didn’t really want to use Microsoft’s AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/microsoft-copilot-everything-you-need-to-know-about-microsofts-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">despite Copilot being weaved into all kinds of Microsoft products</a>.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nadella spent much of his time during the earnings call engaged in what is best described as AI use PR. Despite his pitch, some of the numbers he gave were pretty squishy.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Nadella said daily users of its consumer Copilot AI products had grown “nearly 3x year-over-year.” This refers to AI chats, the news feed, search, browsing, shopping, and “integrations into the operating system.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As to how many actual users that represents, he didn’t say, and Microsoft declined to comment and specify.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, in <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its annual report</a>, the company said it surpassed 100 million monthly active Copilot users, but that counted both commercial users and consumers.  A Microsoft spokesperson tells TechCrunch that this number has grown to 150 million total. Again that includes commercial and consumer users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He was more up front with Microsoft’s coding AI, GitHub Copilot, saying it now has 4.7 million paid subscribers, up 75% year-over-year. That appears to be a healthy business. Last year, in its annual report, Microsoft said that GitHub Copilot had 20 million users, a figure that includes those opting for the free tier.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also said Microsoft 365 Copilot now has 15 million paid seats from companies buying it for their employees. This is out of a base of 450 million paid seats, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Nadella called out the growth of <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/health-solutions/clinical-workflow/dragon-copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dragon Copilot</a>, Microsoft’s healthcare AI agent for medical professionals (a competitor to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/legal-ai-startup-harvey-confirms-8b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">superhot startup Harvey</a>). He said this product is available to 100,000 medical providers and was used to document 21 million patient encounters over the quarter, up threefold year-over-year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Will the billions spent on data centers be worth it? Nadella obviously thinks so. He and CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call that demand for AI services across products far outstrips data center supply, so all of the new equipment is essentially booked to capacity for its lifespan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Waymo said it plans to serve additional airport locations in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s SFO win comes as the company faces criticism and concerns about safety in some of the cities it operates. Waymo revealed Thursday that one of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-robotaxi-hits-a-child-near-an-elementary-school-in-santa-monica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">robotaxis struck a child</a> near an elementary school in Santa Monica. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the January 23 incident, in which the child sustained minor injuries. Waymo is also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">being investigated</a> by the NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board over the illegal behavior of its robotaxis around school buses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Access to airports, and particularly SFO, is critical to Waymo’s business model, which hinges on geographic scale and a high volume of riders. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Serving rides to and from San Francisco International Airport delivers one of the most requested features for our riders and further deepens our relationship with the city,” Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has accelerated its plans over the past year, launching into new cities, increasing its fleet size, and adding freeways to where it operates. Waymo robotaxis now service most of the San Francisco Bay Area and down into Silicon Valley, where it has access to the San Jose Airport. It also operates in parts of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, and most of Phoenix, including curbside service to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/27/waymo-expands-its-curbside-robotaxi-service-to-phoenix-airport/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s push to operate at SFO has taken years. It tried and <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2023/11/waymo-rebuffed-by-sfo-sf-guerilla-warfare-vs-robotaxis-is-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">failed to secure a permit</a> in 2023 to map SFO, a first step to bringing its robotaxis there. Waymo then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/waymo-wants-to-bring-robotaxis-to-sfo-emails-show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rebooted negotiations</a> with the city and airport authority and was granted a permit in March 2025 that would allow it to map SFO with some data-sharing strings attached, according to language in the agreement viewed by TechCrunch at the time.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By September, SFO and Waymo signed a testing and operations pilot permit, pushing the company closer to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/waymo-approved-to-start-testing-autonomous-vehicles-at-san-francisco-international-airport/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">commercial operations</a> at the airport.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Many AI leaders, including those at DeepMind, believe world models are a crucial step to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). But in the nearer term, labs like DeepMind envision a go-to-market plan that starts with video games and other forms of entertainment and branches out into training embodied agents (aka robots) in simulation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepMind’s release of Project Genie comes as the world model race is beginning to heat up. Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs late last year released its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\">first commercial product called Marble</a>. Runway, the AI video-generation startup, has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/\">launched a world model recently</a>. And former Meta chief scientist <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/whos-behind-ami-labs-yann-lecuns-world-model-startup/\">Yann LeCun’s startup AMI Labs</a> will also focus on developing world models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it’s exciting to be in a place where we can have more people access it and give us feedback,” Shlomi Fruchter, a research director at DeepMind, told TechCrunch via video interview, smiling ear-to-ear in clear excitement over Project Genie’s release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepMind researchers that TechCrunch spoke to were upfront about the tool’s experimental nature. It can be inconsistent, sometimes impressively generating playable worlds, other times producing baffling results that miss the mark. Here’s how it works.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genie-marshmallow-castle.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087858\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A claymation-style castle in the sky made of marshmallows and candy</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You start with a “world sketch” by providing text prompts for both the environment and a main character, whom you will later be able to maneuver through the world in either first- or third-person view. Nano Banana Pro creates an image based on the prompts that you can, in theory, modify before Genie uses the image as a jumping off point for an interactive world. The modifications mostly worked, but the model occasionally stumbled and would give you purple hair when you asked for green.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also use real-life photos as a baseline for the model to build a world on, which, again, was hit or miss. (More on that later.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once you’re satisfied with the image, it takes a few seconds for Project Genie to create an explorable world. You can also remix existing worlds into new interpretations by building on top of their prompts, or explore curated worlds in the gallery or via the randomizer tool for inspiration. You can then download videos of the world you just explored. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepMind is only granting 60 seconds of world generation and navigation at the moment, in part due to the budget and compute constraints. Because Genie 3 is <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/autoregressive-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an auto-regressive model</a>, it takes a lot of dedicated compute — which puts a tight ceiling on how much DeepMind is able to provide to users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reason we limit it to 60 seconds is because we wanted to bring it to more users,” Fruchter said. “Basically when you’re using it, there’s a chip somewhere that’s only yours and it’s being dedicated to your session.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that extending it beyond 60 seconds would diminish the incremental value of the testing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The environments are interesting, but at some point, because of their level of interaction the dynamism of the environment is somewhat limited. Still, we see that as a limitation we hope to improve on.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-whimsy-works-realism-doesn-t\"><strong>Whimsy works, realism doesn’t</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087845\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png 3382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=680,364 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=1200,642 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=1280,685 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=430,230 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=720,385 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=900,482 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=800,428 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=1536,822 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=2048,1096 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=668,358 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=1153,617 1153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=708,379 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/little-mermaid-disney-.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Google received a cease-and-desist from Disney last year, so it wouldn’t build models that were Disney-related</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I used the model, the safety guardrails were already up and running. I couldn’t generate anything resembling nudity, nor could I generate worlds that even remotely sniffed of Disney or other copyrighted material. (In December, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-hits-google-with-cease-and-desist-claiming-massive-copyright-infringement/\">Disney hit Google with a cease-and-desist</a>, accusing the firm’s AI models of copyright infringement by training on Disney’s characters and IP and generating unauthorized content, among other things.) I couldn’t even get Genie to generate worlds of mermaids exploring underwater fantasy lands or ice queens in their wintery castles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the demo was deeply impressive. The first world I built was an attempt to live out a small childhood fantasy, in which I could explore a castle in the clouds made up of marshmallows with a chocolate sauce river and trees made of candy. (Yes, I was a chubby kid.) I asked the model to do it in claymation style, and it delivered a whimsical world that childhood me would have eaten up; the castle’s pastel-and-white colored spires and turrets looking puffy and tasty enough to rip off a chunk and dunk into the chocolate moat. (Video above.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Genie6467bd1e8f644c099a541385ac4f78c3-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087851\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A “Game of Thrones” inspired world that failed to generate as photo-realistically as I wanted</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Project Genie still has some kinks to work out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models excelled at creating worlds based on artistic prompts, like using watercolors, anime style, or classic cartoon aesthetics. But it tended to fail when it came to photorealistic or cinematic worlds, often coming out looking like a video game rather than real people in a real setting. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also didn’t always respond well when given real photos to work with. When I gave it a photo of my office and asked it to create a world based on the photo exactly as it was, it gave me a world that had some of the same furnishings of my office — a wooden desk, plants, a grey couch — laid out differently. And it looked sterile, digital, not lifelike. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I fed it a photo of my desk with a stuffed toy, Project Genie animated the toy navigating the space, and even had other objects occasionally react as it moved past them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That interactivity is something DeepMind is working on improving. There were several occasions when my characters walked right through walls or other solid objects. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Genie-bingo-bronson.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087841\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">I asked Project Genie to animate a stuffed toy (Bingo Bronson) so it could explore my desk</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When DeepMind released Genie 3 initially, researchers highlighted how the model’s auto-regressive architecture meant that it could remember what it had generated, so I wanted to test that by returning to parts of the environment it generated already to see if it would be the same. For the most part, the model succeeded. In one case, I generated a cat exploring yet another desk, and only once when I turned back to the right side of the desk did the model generate a second mug.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The part I found most frustrating was the way you navigated the space using the arrows to look around, the spacebar to jump or ascend, and the W-A-S-D keys to move. I’m not a gamer, so this didn’t come naturally to me, but the keys were often non-responsive, or they sent you in the wrong direction. Trying to walk from one side of the room to a doorway on the other side often became a chaotic zigzagging exercise, like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fruchter assured me that his team was aware of these shortcomings, reminding me again that Project Genie is an experimental prototype. In the future, he said, the team hopes to enhance the realism and improve interaction capabilities, including giving users more control over actions and environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t think about [Project Genie] as an end-to-end product that people can go back to everyday, but we think there is already a glimpse of something that’s interesting and unique and can’t be done in another way,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s concerning because the holidays are typically a boon for mobile apps, as people are gifted new smartphones and often have time off from work, allowing them to install new apps and games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decline continued in January 2026, with installs falling 45% month-over-month, to reach 1.2 million. Consumer spending has dropped as well, down 32% month-over-month as of January, Appfigures said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like an AI-flavored TikTok, Sora allows users to create AI videos using prompts. A unique feature allows users to cast themselves and their friends as main characters in the videos, if they choose, while shared videos can be remixed by others who can customize them further. The videos can also include music, sound effects, and dialogue to complete the scenes users create.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, Sora’s app has seen 9.6 million downloads across iOS and Android, and $1.4 million in consumer spending to date.

It currently sits at No. 101. Its highest rank is No. 7 in the Photo &amp; Video category. On Google Play in the U.S., the app fares worse, as it’s No. 181 overall among the top free apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These figures are still too high to write off the app as “dead,” but they are worrying. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decline is likely due to a number of factors working in tandem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For starters, Google’s Gemini, and particularly its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/google-releases-nano-banana-pro-its-latest-image-generation-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nano Banana model</a>, has proven to be fierce competition, helping its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/gemini-tops-the-app-store-thanks-to-new-ai-image-model-nano-banana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gemini AI app gain popularity</a>. Sora also competes with Meta AI, whose app launched an AI-powered Vibes video, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/meta-ais-app-downloads-and-daily-users-spiked-after-launch-of-vibes-ai-video-feed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">boosting its October downloads</a>, just as Sora was taking off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, OpenAI has struggled with containing copyright infringement in Sora. Initially, the company told Hollywood studios and agencies they would have to opt out of having their IP used in Sora, which naturally saw studio <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/07/openais-sora-2-must-stop-allowing-copyright-infringement-mpa-says.html#:~:text=OpenAI's%20Sora%202%20must%20stop%20allowing%20copyright,%22more%20granular%20control%22%20over%20their%20intellectual%20property.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">backlash</a>. But without robust copyright controls, users had been able to create AI videos using popular characters, like SpongeBob and Pikachu, which drove adoption. To appease Hollywood and stave off legal threats, Sora <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/04/sam-altman-says-sora-will-add-granular-opt-in-copyright-controls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">moved from an opt-out to an opt-in model</a> and increased restrictions in the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, the doors opened up a bit more as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-signs-deal-with-openai-to-allow-sora-to-generate-ai-videos-featuring-its-characters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI announced a deal with Disney</a>, which allowed users to generate videos in Sora with its characters. But so far, that news hasn’t increased Sora installs or consumer spending. (It’s also not necessarily a good look for Disney, considering <a href=\"https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/horrifying-sora-videos-disney-characters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some of the depraved videos</a> Sora users had made with its characters.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sora 2 was released to significant hype, with some calling it a <a href=\"https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/the-tiktok-of-ai-why-openais-sora-2-will-disrupt-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disruption</a> to social media and the TikTok of AI. But many users had no interest in letting others — even their friends — use their likeness to make AI videos. Without familiar faces and with limits on using commercial IP, people’s interest in Sora seems to have faded. Whether the app can stage a comeback with more copyright deals or new features remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anthropic</a> case, in which a group of fiction and nonfiction authors similarly accused the AI company of using their copyrighted works to train products like Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that case, Judge William Alsup ruled that it is legal for Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted content. However, he pointed out that it was not legal for Anthropic to acquire that content via piracy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bartz v. Anthropic case became a slap on the wrist worth $1.5 billion for Anthropic, with impacted writers receiving about $3,000 per work for roughly 500,000 copyrighted works. While $1.5 billion seems like a substantial sum, it’s not exactly back-breaking for a company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">valued</a> at $183 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally, these music publishers had filed a lawsuit against Anthropic over its use of about 500 copyrighted works. But through the discovery process in the Bartz case, the publishers say they found that Anthropic had also illegally downloaded thousands more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The publishers tried to amend their original lawsuit to address the piracy issue, but the court denied that motion back in October, ruling they’d failed to investigate the piracy claims earlier. That move prompted the publishers to instead file this separate lawsuit, which also names Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and co-founder Benjamin Mann as defendants.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While Anthropic misleadingly claims to be an AI ‘safety and research’ company, its record of illegal torrenting of copyrighted works makes clear that its multibillion-dollar business empire has in fact been built on piracy,” the lawsuit says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With <a href=\"https://www.mid-day.com/tech/tech-news/article/india-crosses-1-billion-internet-users-as-satellite-internet-drives-digital-growth-23595446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than a billion internet users</a>, the country now accounts for the highest global usage of Gemini for learning, according to Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, within an education system shaped by state-level curricula, strong government involvement, and uneven access to devices and connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Phillips was speaking on the sidelines of Google’s AI for Learning Forum in New Delhi this week, where he met with industry stakeholders, including K-12 school administrators and education officials, to gather feedback on how AI tools are being used in classrooms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scale of India’s education system helps explain why the country has become such a consequential testing ground. The country’s school education system serves about 247 million students across nearly 1.47 million schools, per the Indian government’s <a href=\"https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Economic Survey 2025-26</a>, supported by 10.1 million teachers. Its higher education system is among the world’s largest as well, with <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2097864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 43 million students</a> enrolled in 2021-22 — a 26.5% increase from 2014-15 — complicating efforts to introduce AI tools across systems that are vast, decentralized, and unevenly resourced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the clearest lessons for Google has been that AI in education cannot be rolled out as a single, centrally defined product. In India, where curriculum decisions sit at the state level and ministries play an active role, Phillips said Google has had to design its education AI so that schools and administrators — not the company — decide how and where it is used. That marks a shift for Google, which, like most Silicon Valley firms, has traditionally built products to scale globally rather than bending to the preferences of individual institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are not delivering a one-size-fits-all,” Phillips told TechCrunch. “It’s a very diverse environment around the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond governance, that diversity is also reshaping how Google thinks about AI-driven learning itself. The company is seeing faster adoption of multimodal learning in India, said Phillips, combining video, audio, and images alongside text — reflecting the need to reach students across different languages, learning styles, and levels of access, particularly in classrooms that are not built around text-heavy instruction.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-maintaining-the-teacher-student-relationship\">Maintaining the teacher-student relationship</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A related shift has been Google’s decision to design its AI for education around teachers, rather than students, as the primary point of control. The company has focused on tools that assist educators with planning, assessment, and classroom management, Phillips noted, rather than bypassing them with direct-to-student AI experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The teacher-student relationship is critical,” he said. “We’re here to help that grow and flourish, not replace it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In parts of India, AI in education is being introduced in classrooms that have never had one device per student or reliable internet access. Google is encountering schools where devices are shared, connectivity is inconsistent, or learning jumps directly from pen and paper to AI tools, Phillips said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Access is universally critical, but how and when it happens is very different,” he added, pointing to environments where schools rely on shared or teacher-led devices rather than one-to-one access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Google is translating its early learnings from India into deployments, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/google-turns-gemini-toward-indias-most-competitive-entrance-exam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-powered JEE Main preparation</a> through Gemini, a nationwide teacher training program covering 40,000 Kendriya Vidyalaya educators, and partnerships with government institutions on vocational and higher education, including India’s first AI-enabled state university.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087519\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1200,666 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1280,711 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=430,239 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=720,400 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=900,500 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=800,444 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1536,853 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=668,371 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1111,617 1111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=708,393 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Gemini adds JEE Main preparation for Indian Engineering aspirants</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Google, India’s experience is serving as a preview of challenges likely to surface elsewhere as AI moves deeper into public education systems. The company expects issues around control, access, and localization — now obvious in India — to increasingly shape how AI in education scales globally.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-entertainment-to-learning-as-the-top-ai-use-case\">From entertainment to learning as the top AI use case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s push also reflects a broader shift in how people are using GenAI. Entertainment had dominated AI use cases last year, said Phillips, who added that learning has now emerged as one of the most common ways people engage with the technology, particularly among younger users. As students increasingly turn to AI for studying, exam preparation, and skill-building, education has become a more immediate — and consequential — arena for Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s complex education system is also drawing increasing attention from Google’s rivals. OpenAI has begun building a local leadership presence focused on education, hiring <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/openai-announces-education-push-in-india-hires-second-india-employee/article69975697.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">former Coursera APAC managing director Raghav Gupta</a> as its India and APAC education head and <a href=\"https://openai.com/global-affairs/learning-accelerator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launching a Learning Accelerator program</a> last year. Microsoft, meanwhile, has <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/teachers-in-india-help-microsoft-research-design-ai-tool-for-creating-great-classroom-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded partnerships</a> with Indian institutions, government bodies, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/how-microsoft-planned-usd-3-billion-investment-in-india-is-playing-out-ai-upskilling-edtech-physics-wallah-ws-l-19615473.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">edtech players, including Physics Wallah</a>, to support AI-based learning and teacher training, highlighting how education is becoming a key battleground as AI companies seek to embed their tools into public systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, India’s latest Economic Survey flags risks to students from uncritical AI use, including over-reliance on automated tools and potential impacts on learning outcomes. Citing studies by MIT and Microsoft, the survey noted that “dependence on AI for creative work and writing tasks is contributing to cognitive atrophy and a deterioration of critical thinking capabilities.” This serves as a reminder that the race to enter classrooms is unfolding amid growing concerns over how AI shapes learning itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether Google’s India playbook becomes a model for AI in education elsewhere remains an open question. However, as GenAI moves deeper into public education systems, the pressures now visible in India are likely to surface in other countries as well, making the lessons Google is learning there difficult for the industry to ignore.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
