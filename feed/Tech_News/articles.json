One of its weapons to stave off those threats is a partnership with French automaker Renault Group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two automakers announced an agreement Tuesday to bring two affordable Ford-branded electric vehicles to the European market in 2028. Ford will lead the design and Renault will assemble the vehicles at its factory in northern France. The EVs will be built on Renault’s technology platform known as Ampere.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies have also agreed to “explore” making light commercial vehicles together. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership is part of what Ford has described as the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2025/12/09/Ford-and-Renault-Group-form-strategic-partnership.html\">next phase of its European transformation </a>— a plan that aims to make the U.S. automaker more agile and cost efficient in a market teaming with cheaper Chinese vehicles from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” said Farley in a statement. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

This includes specialized templates with pre-set music and text overlays, as well as a redesigned video editor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new templates are currently rolling out on Android devices and allow users to choose from preset music and text to produce a professional-looking highlight reel in seconds. Users simply select a template and then handpick the photos and videos they want to add. Google Photos will automatically generate a video that aligns with the beat of the music.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The update also makes creating highlight reels in the app quicker and more straightforward. Highlight reels are collections of clips and photos from a user’s gallery, such as moments from a memorable vacation or birthday celebration. To create a highlight reel, users can go to the Create tab and click on “Highlight Video.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GooglePhotos-Templates.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074164\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the company introduced a newly redesigned video editor, available on both Android and iOS devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new editor is intended to be more user-friendly, featuring a “universal timeline” that allows users to view all video clips and other content in one place. It also includes an “adaptive canvas” that adjusts the editing interface according to the user’s needs or the specific project. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also, with this new editor, users can incorporate music and text into a single video clip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the redesigned editor will now serve as the default video editing tool on Android. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Add-Music.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074166\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another new feature is the option to explore Photos’ music library to find the ideal soundtrack for highlight videos.

The space agency told TechCrunch that Canoo “was no longer able to meet our mission requirements.” As of October, NASA said it is leasing the Airstream-built “Astrovan” from Boeing that the aerospace company <a href=\"https://www.airstream.com/space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">commissioned for its own crewed space missions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the USPS said in an emailed statement the six vehicles it purchased “for evaluation purposes” in 2024 “are no longer in use.” The “evaluation has been completed,” the postal service wrote, and “no further investments are anticipated.” The USPS declined to share any details or final results of the evaluation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canoo also provided at least one demonstration vehicle to the Department of Defense (DOD) before its bankruptcy. The DOD did not respond to emailed requests about whether it has continued using the van.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canoo filed for bankruptcy in January 2025 after years of financial struggles and failing to establish a market for its electric vans. Soon after, former CEO Tony Aquila made a $4 million bid <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/canoos-ceo-is-buying-the-bankrupt-ev-startups-assets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for the startup’s assets in March</a>. Aquila told the bankruptcy trustee that a “principal motivation” for buying the assets was his “desire to honor [Canoo’s] commitment to provide service and support for certain government programs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NASA and the USPS declined to share whether Aquila ever approached either agency about supporting the vehicles. Aquila did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer who represented Aquila in the bankruptcy proceedings also did not respond. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bankruptcy judge <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/canoo-ceo-can-buy-bankrupt-ev-startups-assets-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">approved the sale to Aquila in April</a>. He was not the only entity interested in buying the company’s assets, though. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As many as eight parties signed NDAs to evaluate Canoo’s intellectual property, prototypes, and equipment, the bankruptcy trustee said at the time. A lawyer for Canoo said a handful of those parties came close to making a bid. One was Harbinger, a California-based electric trucking company that was created by former Canoo employees in 2021. Another was a mysterious financier from the U.K. named Charles Garson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger, at the time, had accused Canoo of hiding assets from the sale process. It also claimed the bankruptcy trustee had “unfairly favored Mr. Aquila” by accepting his offer without widely marketing the bankrupt company’s assets. Garson claimed to be willing to pay as much as $20 million for Canoo’s assets, but the judge ultimately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/mystery-investors-attempt-to-stop-canoo-asset-sale-shot-down-by-judge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decided the investor did not formalize his bid in time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trustee and lawyers for Canoo argued that Aquila presented the best and most firm bid. They also claimed one of the other potential bidders — though they never specified who — could have raised concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States because of its “foreign ownership.” Lawyers for Aquila and Canoo flagged this as a particular problem in light of the contracts with NASA, the USPS, and the DOD. Harbinger and Garson declined to comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anchoring the AAIF at launch are donations from Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is donating its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/github-microsoft-embrace-anthropics-spec-for-connecting-ai-models-to-data-sources/\">MCP</a> (Model Context Protocol), a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/anthropic-proposes-a-way-to-connect-data-to-ai-chatbots/\">standard way to connect models and agents</a> to tools and data; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/block/\">Block</a> is contributing Goose, its open-source agent framework; and OpenAI is bringing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://agents.md\">AGENTS.md</a> to the table, its simple instruction file developers can add to a repository to tell AI coding tools how to behave. You can think of these tools as the basic plumbing of the agent era. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other members in the AAIF include<strong> </strong>AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Google, signaling an industry-level push for shared guardrails so that AI agents can be trustworthy at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In OpenAI engineer Nick Cooper’s view, protocols are essentially a shared language that lets different <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-agentkit-to-help-developers-build-and-ship-ai-agents/\">agents</a> and systems work together without every developer reinventing integrations from scratch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need multiple [protocols] to negotiate, communicate, and work together to deliver value for people, and that sort of openness and communication is why it’s not ever going to be one provider, one host, one company,” Cooper told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/13/jim-zemlin-on-taking-a-portfolio-approach-to-linux-foundation-projects/\">Jim Zemlin</a>, executive director of the Linux Foundation, put it more bluntly in conversations around the launch: the goal is to avoid a future of “closed wall” proprietary stacks, where tool connections, agent behavior, and orchestration are locked behind a handful of platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By bringing these projects together under the AAIF, we are now able to coordinate interoperability, safety patterns, and best practices specifically for AI agents,” Zemlin said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Block – the fintech company behind Square and Cash App – isn’t known for AI infrastructure, but it’s making an openness play with Goose. AI Tech Lead Brad Axen frames it as proof that open alternatives can match proprietary agents at scale, with thousands of engineers using it weekly for coding, data analysis, and documentation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Open-sourcing Goose serves a dual purpose for Block. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Getting it out into the world gives us a place for other people to come help us make it better,” Axen told TechCrunch. “We have a lot of contributors from open source, and everything they do to improve it comes back to our company.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, donating Goose to the Linux Foundation gives Block access to community stress-tests while positioning it as a working example of AAIF’s vision – an agent framework designed to plug into shared building blocks like MCP and AGENTS.md.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is making a similar move at the protocol layer, handing MCP to the Linux Foundation. The goal: make MCP the neutral infrastructure connecting AI models to tools, data, and applications without endless one-off adapters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The main goal is to have enough adoption in the world that it’s the de facto standard,” MCP co-creator David Soria Parra told TechCrunch. “We’re all better off if we have an open integration center where you can build something once as a developer and use it across any client.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Donating MCP to AAIF signals that the protocol won’t be controlled by a single vendor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That governance point is central to why the Linux Foundation created a new umbrella at all. The organization already hosts major AI and developer infrastructure projects – everything from PyTorch and Ray to Kubernetes – but says AAIF is specifically aimed at agent standards and orchestration, including shared safety patterns and interoperability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AAIF’s structure is funded through a “directed fund,” meaning companies can contribute money through membership dues. But Zemlin of the Linux Foundation argues that funding doesn’t equal control: project roadmaps are set by technical steering committees, and no single member gets unilateral say over direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the big question is whether AAIF becomes real infrastructure or just another industry logo alliance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“An early indicator of success, in addition to adoption of these standards, would be the development and implementation of shared standards being used by vendor agents around the world,” Zemlin said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For OpenAI’s Cooper, success would look like an evolution of standards: “I don’t want it to be a stagnant thing. I don’t want these protocols to be part of this foundation, and that’s where they sat for two years. They should evolve and continually accept further input.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a more subtle consequence: even with open governance, one company’s implementation could become the default simply because it ships fastest or gains the most usage. Zemlin says that’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. He points to open-source history – like Kubernetes “winning” the container race – as evidence that “dominance emerges from merit and not vendor control.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For developers and enterprises, the short-term appeal is clear: less time building custom connectors, more predictable agent behavior across codebases, and simpler deployment in security-conscious environments. <br>The larger vision is more ambitious: if tools like MCP, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://agents.md\">AGENTS.md</a>, and Goose become standard infrastructure, the agent landscape could shift from closed platforms to an open, mix-and-match software world reminiscent of the interoperable systems that built the modern web.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That is what I felt when unboxing Fairphone’s <a href=\"https://shop.fairphone.com/nl/fairbuds-xl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new $229 Fairbuds XL over-the-ear headphones</a> in the forest green shade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new headphones, which also come in black, compete with others on the market, like Nothing Headphones (1), Sony’s previous-gen WH-1000XM5, and Sonos Ace. While some of those offer better sound and noise cancellation capabilities, Fairbuds XL would be a good bet if longevity and repairability matter more to you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new devices are an update to the Fairbuds XL with noise cancellation, first launched in 2023 and designed with repairability in mind. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On these headphones, owners can replace the battery, cushions, speaker covers, headband, and drivers on both the new and older models. To make repairs, you can easily open the headphones with a guitar pick or a credit card and a basic screwdriver. The company has tutorials on its YouTube channel to guide you through the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new iteration carries that same ethos but includes some subtle design changes as well as a driver upgrade to improve performance. Specifically, the company said that the driver size is still 40mm, but it’s been upgraded with better magnets for improved bass.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite installing new drivers with enhanced bass, the overall sound signature is largely neutral. Both mids and vocals came through while listening to songs. For instance, some of the tracks on the “K-Pop Demon Hunter” album have some bass-heavy sections, but that didn’t cloud the vocals or synth. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074050\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54973252714_826bbba85f_k.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Fairphone</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The design changes include making the speaker-to-speaker cable and the joystick green instead of orange.

You can use the joystick to play and pause, control volume, and switch to the next or previous track. The button also acts as a switch for pairing mode and lets you cycle between noise cancellation modes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone is not alone in prioritizing a functional button.

While I work from home, there is a lot of noise in the neighborhood, and I prefer to wear noise-cancellation earbuds or headphones. You won’t get AirPods’ level of noise cancellation with these devices, but the experience was still good. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone CTO Chandler Hatton said that the release cycle of the headphones and backward compatibility is a conscious choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can release the products faster. This is a conscientious decision to do it a little bit more slowly. We’d like to show the industry that it’s not necessary to push products out of the market by introducing a new one, because this creates the cycle of what’s sometimes referred to as planned obsolescence,” she told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company noted that it uses fair-mined and recycled materials to build these headphones. To reduce packaging waste, its box just contains a simple protective pouch and the headphones themselves, along with a quick-start guide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This company claims the device’s battery life is up to 30 hours, but this is reduced if you have active noise cancellation on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lack of a headphone jack in favor of USB-C bugged me a bit. Even if you don’t want to add extra accessories to your package, adding support for a standard audio jack is something that could also make the headphones compatible with more audio devices. (You can pick up a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle from Fairphone at around $15.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fairphone has gone through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/28/fairphone-ceo-eva-gouwens-to-step-down/\">a few executive</a> changes in the last two years. The company said that the new management wants to prove that it can produce and distribute gadgets at scale, and the U.S. expansion is part of that plan. The headphones are one of the company’s first products to get a full release in the U.S. and will include support for replacement parts and a three-year warranty. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While consumers can buy the Fairbuds XL on Fairphone’s site, the device will launch on Amazon later this month for U.S. customers, along with the company’s $99 wireless earbuds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s one way to look at Tuesday’s <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/12/making-it-easier-to-create-discover-and-share-content-on-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a> from the company formerly known as Facebook: Meta is revamping its flagship app with a number of features focused on connecting friends, along with design changes, including a renewed focus on what still works, like its popular Facebook Marketplace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes come days after news of Meta considering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/meta-reportedly-plans-to-slash-metaverse-budget-by-up-to-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sizable cuts to its metaverse efforts</a>, which, before the AI boom, aimed to make virtual worlds and VR the company’s next big bet in social networking. Meanwhile, Facebook still reaches <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">billions</a>, even if its <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/02/5-facts-about-how-americans-use-facebook-two-decades-after-its-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growth remains flat</a> in key markets like the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Facebook’s population ages, the app remains in heavy use among boomers and Gen Xers. That’s led Meta to try to find a footing among a younger demographic. After failed attempts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/02/facebook-is-shutting-down-its-college-student-only-social-network-campus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reboot Facebook as a home for college kids</a>, the company has been making more noise recently around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/mark-zuckerberg-teases-a-2025-return-to-og-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">giving Facebook a Gen Z makeover</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s been resonating with younger people <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/business/gen-z-facebook-marketplace.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is Facebook Marketplace</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s online marketplace is used by more than half of its Gen Z users in the U.S., according to a <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/us-social-media-users-by-generation-2025?_gl=1*emvoar*_gcl_au*MTgwMzY4ODczLjE3NjUyMjk5MTQ.*_ga*OTU4NDcyMDc2LjE3NjUyMjk5MTQ.*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*czE3NjUyMjk5MTQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjUyMjk5MTQkajYwJGwwJGgxMDUyNjUyMzU2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2025 eMarketer report</a> on social media users. Last month, Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/11/facebook-marketplace-gets-a-glow-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed the trend</a>, noting that Marketplace was used by one out of four young adult daily active Facebook users in the U.S. and Canada.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the traction, however, Marketplace has remained buried in the “More” menu under users’ profiles in the Facebook app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new update, rolling out soon, will add Marketplace to the app’s bottom navigation bar, alongside other social and creator-focused features like Reels and Friends.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074131\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg 1454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=768,679 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=1200,1061 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=1280,1132 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=430,380 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=720,637 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=900,796 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=800,708 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=668,591 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=424,375 424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=698,617 698w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=600,531 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-nav.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reels and direct messaging have been the most popular features on Instagram, the company said earlier this year, which is why it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/instagram-is-testing-a-reels-first-ui-in-india-and-south-korea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">began testing a redesign that centered those</a> in the mobile experience. Now Facebook is getting similar treatment in terms of recentering friends as part of the experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Profile tab will remain in the navigation bar, and users will be able to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/www/2741283262582983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">customize the experience</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another part of the makeover will allow users to double-tap photos in their Feed to like them, similar to Instagram. These photos will be arranged in a standardized grid, and users will be able to see photos full-screen by clicking them.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Feed-Updates_final.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074123\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Search is changing to include a more immersive grid layout to support all content types. Facebook will also test a new full-screen viewer that would let you explore photo and video results without losing your place.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Facebook says it’s making it easier to create Stories and regular posts by making tools for adding music or tagging friends more visible, and eliminating other distractions. Audience and cross-posting settings will now be more prominently displayed as well.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Feed_creation_final.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074125\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commenting across Feed, Groups, and Reels is getting its own set of tweaks. Replies are getting more streamlined, badges will be more visible, and users get new pinning tools. Meta says this will make conversations easier to follow, and expanded controls will let creators and admins more easily monitor conversations. Plus, everyone will be able to anonymously flag irrelevant comments and users who disrupt the conversation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Feed, users will be able to give feedback as to why they don’t like a post or Reel to better personalize their experience.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg 1464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=300,264 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=768,676 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=680,598 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=1200,1056 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=1280,1126 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=430,378 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=720,633 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=900,792 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=800,704 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=668,588 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=426,375 426w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=701,617 701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=604,531 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tell-fb-why-.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A final change sees Facebook trying to regain its reputation as a place for connecting friends. That’s something it was once known best for, before prioritizing other types of content like news and creator videos, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/in-antitrust-hearing-zuckerberg-admits-facebook-has-copied-its-competition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trying to</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/17/metas-latest-experiment-copies-bereal-and-snapchats-core-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">copy</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/10/facebook-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">or</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquire</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/facebook-acquires-activity-tracking-app-moves/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">every</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/facebook-acquires-branch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">semi</a>–<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/to-boost-commerce-in-ads-facebook-buys-and-shuts-down-shopping-site-thefind/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">successful</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/01/facebook-beluga/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">social</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/20/facebook-buys-hot-potato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">app</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is rolling out updated user profiles, letting people add more information about their interests, hobbies, and travel. Here, users can include more information about themselves, like what TV shows they like, what music they’re streaming, favorite travel spots, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These are the kinds of things people used to share more freely before they realized that Facebook was only using their data to better target ads. The company is now throwing users a bone in terms of new functionality, at least — if you share that you enjoy something like baking your own bread, or are planning a trip to a certain city, for instance, it will connect you with friends who share the interest or who can give tips.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074130\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg 1460w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=300,264 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=768,676 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=680,599 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=1200,1057 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=1280,1127 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=430,379 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=720,634 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=900,793 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=800,705 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=668,588 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=426,375 426w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=700,617 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=603,531 603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-fb-profiles.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta/Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, Facebook has long had the habit of trying to juice engagement by pushing every profile update to your Feed, like if you changed your profile picture or background photo — a feature many Facebook users <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/140uecb/how_do_you_upload_a_new_facebook_cover_photo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">found</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/how-to-update-cover-photo-on-facebook-without-posting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">annoying</a> and even embarrassing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this revamp, however, users will be able to decide if those updates are shared to their Feed, a decision that could increase adoption, Facebook hopes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes could impact how content is ranked in users’ Feeds, which is already a personalized experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new features will roll out globally over the weeks ahead.

The tech giant hasn’t given up on that dream yet: Its AI assistant, Alexa+, is getting new shopping-enabled features in the U.S. and Canada from today, including a shopping hub, tools to add items to recent orders, and personalized recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has already been working on features that make Alexa+ more of a shopping assistant with abilities like automated deal tracking and automatic purchases. The former feature lets you set Alexa to alert you when items in your cart or list drop below a certain price point. If you also have automatic purchases set up, Alexa can immediately order an item when it reaches that target price.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Amazon says it’s turning its Echo devices with a screen — the Echo Show 15 and 21 — into a shopping hub with an interface that it’s calling the “Shopping Essentials” experience. From this dashboard, Amazon shoppers can track deliveries in real time, see information about recent orders, get reminders about household essentials they need to reorder, and view their shopping list and saved items.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?w=680\" alt=\"Echo Show\" class=\"wp-image-2918385\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png 767w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/amazon-echo-show-15-21.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The screen would also let shoppers tap to see more products and add items directly to their cart and then check out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To access the new experience, Amazon users can say “Alexa, where’s my stuff?” or “Open Shopping Essentials.” Soon, a shopping widget will be available to add to the Echo device’s home screen, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another new feature rolling out now will allow Alexa device owners to add items to an upcoming delivery at any time until the item leaves the warehouse. This builds on a similar feature recently added to Amazon’s retail website and app, so it isn’t necessarily an Alexa+ exclusive, but the feature wasn’t live on Alexa devices so far.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ is also gaining the ability to recommend gifts. You’ll be able to describe who you’re shopping for, or the occasion, and Alexa+ will display product suggestions on the screen, organized into categories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says Alexa+ is now available to “tens of millions” of customers, and these new features are live for users in the U.S. and Canada. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1obm7ii/is_there_a_way_to_remove_alexa_and_go_back_to_the/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">While</a> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-out-but-missing-a-lot-of-features-amazon-demoed-last-month-180741504.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/1lafqsq/alexa_plus_rollback_to_previous_version/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">everyone</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1ochmnh/i_assume_theres_no_way_to_downgrade_alexa_back_to/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1l4dyht/tried_alexa_and_downgraded_right_awayshow_15/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">been</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nshk6v/alexa_the_downgrade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">happy</a> with Alexa+, the company says the percentage of users who <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TxQg5eM59c1YXhLnCu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">downgraded</a> back to the AI-free interface remains in the “very low single digits.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The other model has an in-lens display — which is only visible to the person wearing the glasses — that can show turn-by-turn directions or closed captioning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google also shared a preview of the wired XR glasses from Xreal called Project Aura. This model situates itself between a bulky headset and an unobtrusive pair of glasses. Beyond just an in-lens display, the Project Aura glasses can function as an extended workplace or entertainment device, allowing the user to use Google’s suite of products or stream video as they would in a more advanced headset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta has gotten off to an early lead in smart glasses development, Google now joins <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/apple-could-launch-ai-powered-smart-glasses-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/snap-plans-to-sell-lightweight-consumer-ar-glasses-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Snap</a> among the companies expected to challenge Meta with their own hardware next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s smart glasses have caught on in part thanks to its partnership with Ray-Ban, and it sells these products in retail stores. Google’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-commits-150m-to-develop-ai-glasses-with-warby-parker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnership</a> with Warby Parker seems like it will follow a similar strategy, committing $75 million thus far to support the eyewear company’s product development and commercialization costs. If Warby Parker meets certain milestones, Google will commit an additional $75 million and take an equity stake in the brand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2964\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has launched an investigation</a> into whether Google may have breached EU’s competition laws by using content from websites without compensating owners to generate answers for its AI summaries that appear above search results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EC also will look at how AI summaries use videos from YouTube to generate answers. The investigation will examine if Google is harming competition in the AI market by granting itself access to websites’ content, and imposing “unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Commission will investigate to what extent the generation of AI Overviews and AI Mode by Google is based on web publishers’ content without appropriate compensation for that, and without the possibility for publishers to refuse without losing access to Google Search,” the bloc’s executive arm wrote in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s AI Overview and AI Mode are the two chief products being investigated here, and the EC highlights that the tech giant doesn’t leave websites or content producers with much choice since it directs a majority of web traffic, doesn’t pay them for using their content, and doesn’t allow YouTube uploads if you don’t let Google use that data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EU is also concerned over the fact that Google doesn’t allow rival AI companies to use YouTube content to train their own AI models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investigation comes at a time when companies developing AI models and content are being sued for copyright infringement by publishers and websites. AI search tool Perplexity, for one, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/the-new-york-times-is-suing-perplexity-for-copyright-infringement/\">has been sued by several  outlets</a>, including The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, News Corp, New York Post, Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, and Reddit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EU’s investigation differs, however, because in many cases, these media companies are suing as a way to negotiate content-licensing deals with AI firms in hopes of compensating creators and being paid for their content. The EU is seeking to level the playing field for AI companies that compete with Google, which according to <a href=\"https://www.cautiousoptimism.news/p/google-sees-more-than-other-ai-companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some reports</a>, benefits from its reach by being able to train its AI models on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-matthew-prince-cloudflare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">much more of the internet</a> than its rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under consistent and widespread criticism of its AI regulation, however, the EU is considering <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-ease-ai-privacy-rules-critics-warn-caving-big-tech-trump-2025-11-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">simplifying its AI rules</a>, and has proposed to delay the implementation of rules for the use of AI in high-risk applications.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Moreover, the investment aligns with New Delhi’s push to <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2178092\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">accelerate digital infrastructure and AI adoption</a> across sectors, as India looks to position itself as a global technology hub while addressing concerns around data governance and equitable access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement comes during Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s visit to India and follows his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, ahead of a keynote in New Delhi on Wednesday. The Redmond-based company also said it will open a new data center region in Hyderabad by mid-2026, its largest in India, comprising three availability zones — a footprint the company described as roughly the size of two Eden Gardens stadiums. Microsoft said it will continue expanding its three existing data-center regions in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the push, Microsoft also announced it will work with the Ministry of Labour and Employment to integrate advanced AI capabilities into two of its flagship digital public platforms — e-Shram and the National Career Service — to offer AI-driven services to more than 310 million informal workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two Indian government platforms will use Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to provide multilingual access, AI-assisted job matching, predictive analytics on skill and demand trends, automated résumé creation, and personalized pathways, the company said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft also said it is rolling out new sovereign cloud options for Indian customers, including a Sovereign Public Cloud now available across its India regions and a Sovereign Private Cloud powered by Azure Local for both connected and air-gapped operations. The offerings would help enterprises meet regulatory and data-residency requirements and support high-performance workloads with access to the latest Nvidia GPUs and Microsoft 365 services, the company noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Microsoft said its skilling efforts are also accelerating, noting that through its “ADVANTA(I)GE India” initiative, it has trained 5.6 million people since January — well ahead of its goal of training 10 million by 2030 — with the programs enabling more than 125,000 individuals to secure jobs or start businesses. The company is doubling its earlier commitment and now aims to equip 20 million Indians with basic AI skills by 2030, working with government agencies, industry partners, and digital public platforms to broaden access to training.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-attracts-global-tech-firms-in-the-ai-era\">India attracts global tech firms in the AI era</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s investment commitment comes just months after Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced a $15 billion plan</a> to build an AI hub and data-center infrastructure in India — the company’s largest investment in the country and one that follows its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earlier $10 billion pledge</a> in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the recent months, India has emerged as an especially attractive market for global tech companies as they look for regions to expand their AI footprint, drawn by the country’s vast base of internet subscribers, hundreds of millions of smartphone users, a fast-growing startup ecosystem, and the Indian government’s aggressive digitization agenda — all of which promise both consumer scale and enterprise demand.

Despite the constraints, New Delhi has rolled out incentives for AI and semiconductor projects, eased some regulatory hurdles, and encouraged partnerships with domestic telecom and IT firms to anchor more of the global AI value chain in India.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Microsoft has been part of India’s fabric for more than three decades,” said Puneet Chandok, president, Microsoft India and South Asia, in a prepared statement. “As the nation moves confidently into its AI-first future, we are proud to stand as a trusted partner in advancing the infrastructure, innovation, and opportunity that can power a billion dreams.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft already employs more than 22,000 people across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, Noida, and other cities, including engineering teams that build AI products such as Copilot Studio, Azure AI Search, AI agents, speech and translation tools, and Azure Machine Learning for global markets, while also supporting the company’s domestic operations.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Every person leaving has contributed meaningfully to VSCO and our mission, and we are deeply grateful for their impact. The company is restructuring and adjusting internal operations to be more efficient and effective in delivering long-term success and value for photographers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To succeed over the next 5 years, we need to operate as an AI-native company, taking bold but focused bets and strengthening the foundation we’ve built through our Pro business, AI Lab, TFP, and Sites,” Wittman wrote in the memo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">VSCO said that to power growth, it wants to increase brand awareness as well as work on AI-powered features across the line. The company plans to work on a revamped “AI native” editor, and build an AI assistant that could help users complete tasks across its tools. The startup also plans to redesign its public Photo Galleries feature, which lets photographers curate their portfolio and showcase their work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, VSCO launched a marketplace to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/vsco-launches-a-new-hub-to-connect-creators-and-brands/\">connect photographers and brands for projects</a>. This year, VSCO focused on shipping AI-powered products such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/vsco-is-launching-an-ai-powered-collaborative-moodboard/\">Canvas for collaboration</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/vsco-gets-ai-editing-chops-support-for-raw-files/\">new editing features</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As consumer apps like Canva, Google Photos, and Adobe Lightroom focus on adding AI features to their products, it appears VSCO may have realized that instead of AI chops, carving a niche for itself by providing better tools and a dedicated platform for pro photographers would be a good strategy.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The proposal argues that this “mandatory blanket license” would lower compliance costs for AI firms while ensuring that writers, musicians, artists, and other rights holders are compensated when their work is scraped to train commercial models.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s proposal comes amid mounting concerns in global markets over how AI companies train their models on copyrighted material, a practice that has triggered lawsuits from authors, news organizations, artists, and other rights holders in the U.S. and Europe. Courts and regulators are still weighing whether such training qualifies as fair use, leaving AI firms operating under legal uncertainty and allowing them to rapidly expand their business without clear regulations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the U.S. and the European Union, where policymakers are debating transparency obligations and fair-use boundaries, India is proposing one of the most interventionist approaches yet by giving AI companies automatic access to copyrighted material in exchange for mandatory payment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The eight-member committee, formed by the Indian government in late April, argues the system would avoid years of legal uncertainty while ensuring creators are compensated from the outset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Defending the system, the committee says in a <a href=\"https://www.dpiit.gov.in/static/uploads/2025/12/ff266bbeed10c48e3479c941484f3525.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">125-page submission</a> (PDF) that a blanket license “aims to provide an easy access to content for AI developers… reduce transaction costs… [and] ensure fair compensation for rightsholders,” calling it the least burdensome way to manage large-scale AI training. The submission adds that the single collecting body would function as a “single window,” eliminating the need for individual negotiations and enabling royalties to flow to both registered and unregistered creators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The committee also points to India’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/29/billionaire-ambani-taps-google-meta-to-build-indias-ai-backbone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">growing importance as a market for GenAI tools</a>. Citing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s remark that India is the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. and “may well become our largest,” it argues that because AI firms derive significant revenue from Indian users while relying on Indian creators’ work to train their models, a portion of that value should flow back to those creators. That, it says, is part of the rationale for establishing a “balanced framework” that guarantees compensation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s proposal lands amid intensifying legal battles worldwide over whether AI companies can lawfully use copyrighted material to train their models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In India, news agency ANI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/indian-news-agency-sues-openai-alleging-copyright-infringement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sued OpenAI in the Delhi High Court</a>, arguing its articles were used without permission — a case that has prompted the court to examine whether AI training is itself an act of reproduction or protected by “fair dealing.” Courts in the U.S. and Europe are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/court-rules-that-openai-violated-german-copyright-law-ordered-it-to-pay-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">confronting similar disputes</a>, with creators alleging that tech companies have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/the-new-york-times-wants-openai-and-microsoft-to-pay-for-training-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">built their models on unlicensed content</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-proposal-sees-pushback-and-dissent\">AI proposal sees pushback and dissent </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not everyone is convinced by the Indian government’s proposed model, though. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nasscom, the industry body representing technology firms, including Google and Microsoft, filed a formal dissent arguing that India should instead adopt a broad text-and-data-mining exception that would allow AI developers to train on copyrighted content as long as the material is lawfully accessed. It warned that a mandatory licensing regime could slow innovation and said rightsholders who object should be allowed to opt out rather than force companies to pay for all training data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Business Software Alliance, which represents global tech firms, including Adobe, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft, pressed the Indian government to avoid a purely licensing-based regime. It urged India to introduce an explicit text-and-data-mining exception, arguing that “relying solely on direct or statutory licensing for AI training data may be impractical and may not yield the best outcomes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Limiting AI models to smaller sets of licensed or public-domain material, BSA warned, could reduce model quality and “increase the risk that outputs simply reflect trends and biases of the limited training data sets,” adding that a clear TDM exception would better balance innovation and rights holders’ interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The committee did not consider both a broad text-and-data-mining exception and an opt-out model, arguing that such systems either undermine copyright protections or are impossible to enforce. Instead, it proposed a “hybrid model” that would grant AI firms automatic access to all lawfully available copyrighted works while requiring them to pay royalties into the central collecting body that distributes the proceeds to creators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government has now opened the proposal for public consultation, giving companies and other stakeholders 30 days to submit their comments. After reviewing the feedback, the committee will finalize its recommendations before the framework is taken up by the government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI and Google did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At launch, it’s water-resistant to 1 meter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring is also not a fitness tracker or sleep monitor. It doesn’t record details about your heart rate or health. And it’s not there to be your AI friend. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m not trying to build some AI assistant thing,” Migicovsky told TechCrunch in an interview. “I build things that solve one main problem, and they solve it really well,” he explains. “I think of [the ring] as external memory for my brain … That’s what this is. It’s always with you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, the ring has been designed to be highly reliable and privacy-preserving, he says, as all your thoughts are stored on your phone, not in the cloud. There is no subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky’s ring enters a growing market for voice-note wearables. Last month, Sandbar, a New York-based startup founded by former Meta employees, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unveiled its Stream Ring</a>, which also lets users record thoughts via a touch-activated microphone. However, unlike Index 01’s no-subscription model, Sandbar’s $249 ring offers both a free tier with limited AI interactions and a $10-per-month Stream Pro subscription for unlimited chats and early access to features. The Stream Ring is expected to ship next summer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky has been wearing his own ring for three months now and says he cannot imagine going back to a world where he doesn’t always have a memory device with him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The problem is that, during the day, I get ideas or I remember something, and if I don’t write it down that second, I forget it,” he says. The ring solves this problem, he adds, without becoming another device you need to charge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The battery lasts for years,” Migicovsky claims. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring is said to support roughly 12 to 14 hours of recording. On average, the founder says he uses it 10 to 20 times per day to record 3- to 6-second thoughts. At that rate, he’ll get about two years of usage. When the ring’s battery dies, you can ship it back to the company for recycling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When using the Index, you can record up to five minutes of audio, which can be saved to the ring and synced to your phone later. This makes sense for recording briefer, personal thoughts and notes, even when you don’t have your phone handy, but it wouldn’t work for recording a longer chat, like a presentation, meeting, or in-person interview of some kind.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073862\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-trio-flat.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Core Devices LLC</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring also supports more than 100 languages and has a bit of on-device memory for times when you’re not in Bluetooth range of your device, where the recording is ultimately saved and transcribed. (The raw audio is retained, too, in case the speech-to-text is garbled due to loud background noise.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you own a Pebble smartwatch or one from another brand, your recorded thought can even appear on the watch’s screen so you can verify it’s correct. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring works with Pebble’s mobile app, which offers notes and reminders but can optionally integrate with your phone’s calendaring system, too, or other apps, like Notion. And the ring’s software is open source, which makes it hackable by the community, the founder points out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because of its open nature, the ring’s button is already programmable. In addition to the press-and-hold gesture, you can program the ring to do other things with a single or double press, like play or pause your music or control the shutter on your phone’s camera. You could use it to send a message through the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/pebble-founder-launches-beeper-a-universal-chat-app-that-works-with-imessage-and-others/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">universal chat app Beeper,</a> which Migicovsky also created, or you could add your own voice actions via <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MCP</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073865\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=768,705 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=680,624 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=430,395 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=720,661 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=900,826 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=800,734 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=668,613 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=409,375 409w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=672,617 672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=578,531 578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Index01-matte-black-hero.png?resize=50,46 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Core Devices LLC</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-approach-to-hardware\">A new approach to hardware </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky acknowledges that hardware can be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/23/smartwatch-firm-pebble-lays-off-25-of-its-staff/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">difficult</a> to get right, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/fitbit-pebble-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pebble’s exit to Fitbit</a> showed. (Fitbit was later acquired by Google in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/googles-fitbit-acquisition-is-official/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2021</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I didn’t earn any money during Pebble — we exited, but it was not a great exit,” Migicovsky admits.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, however, he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/smartwatch-pioneer-and-kickstarter-darling-pebble-is-returning-in-a-new-form/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decided to reboot the Pebble project</a> after Google open sourced PebbleOS, which opened the door to new hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With his new company, Core Devices, Migicovsky plans to do things differently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the founder doesn’t regret his previous choices, he clarifies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I wouldn’t have gone back and changed anything. I loved what we built. I loved what we did. I love the company that we built, but it’s not the only way to build a company,” he told TechCrunch. “And speaking as an ex-YC partner, there’s a time and a place for building a venture-backed startup. Some companies are phenomenal when they raise money and build a big team, and I tried that … What I’m doing now is trying an alternative path, which is [to] start from profitability,” he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new company is a small team of five, self-funded, and focused on sustainability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Core Devices has shipped the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pebbles-smartwatch-is-back-pebble-time-2-specs-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pebble 2 Duo smartwatch</a> with a black-and-white display. Its first run sold out, and the company is now preparing to ship the upgraded version, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pebbles-smartwatch-is-back-pebble-time-2-specs-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pebble Time 2</a>. The newer device, which has seen 25,000 preorders, is a stainless steel watch with a larger, color e-ink screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the Index 01, the ring’s preorder offer ends in March 2026. After that, the price increases to $99. It currently comes in silver, polished gold, and matte black and works with iOS and Android devices. Customers can select from eight ring sizes, ranging from 6 to 13.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Similar to its AI assistant, Le Chat, which can <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/02/mistral_ais_le_chat_can/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remember previous conversations</a> with users and use that context to guide its answers, Vibe CLI features persistent history and can scan file structures and Git statuses to build context to inform its behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This focus on production-grade workflows also explains why Devstral 2 is relatively demanding, requiring at least four H100 GPUs or equivalent for deployment, and weighing 123 billion parameters. However, the model is also available in a smaller size with Devstral Small, which, at 24 billion parameters, makes it deployable locally on consumer hardware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models differ in their open source licensing — Devstral 2 ships under a modified MIT license, while Devstral Small uses Apache 2.0.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also differ in pricing. Devstral 2 is currently free to use via the company’s API. After the free period, the API pricing will cost $0.40/$2.00 per million tokens (input/output) for Devstral 2, and $0.10/$0.30 for Devstral Small.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mistral has partnered with agent tools Kilo Code and Cline to release Devstral 2 to users, while Mistral Vibe CLI is available as an extension in Zed for use inside the IDE.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Europe’s champion AI lab, Mistral is currently valued at €11.7 billion (approximately $13.8 billion) following a Series C funding round <a href=\"https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2025/ASML-Mistral-AI-enter-strategic-partnership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">led by Dutch semiconductor company ASML</a>, which invested €1.3 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) in September.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The first lesson was knowing the difference between what businesses need versus what sounds visionary; the second was that the fundamentals always apply, even with new technologies such as AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Security, compliance, reliability, quality, those things don’t just go away for enterprise applications,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After CodeSee was acquired in 2024, Leven decided that she wanted to build a product that would let business owners, even those without technical backgrounds, build AI applications. She teamed up with AI researcher Sean Robinson, and last October, the two launched <a href=\"https://empromptu.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Empromptu,</a> an AI service that businesses can use to build AI applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Empromptu claims all a user has to do is tell the platform’s AI chatbot what they want — like a new classification app or a generative recommendation app — and the tool will go ahead and build it. It also provides LLM tools to help users if they want to fine-tune any results and lets companies add AI features to their own existing code bases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leven doesn’t consider it a vibe-coding platform, though she does look to compete with companies like Replit and Lovable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Vibe coding is excellent for quick experiments, but Empromptu is what turns those experiments into real software,” she said. Empromptu, she continued, “turns ideas into production features with built-in evaluation, governance, and self-improvement. You ship to real customers, with real data and complete control. If vibe coding is the brainstorm, Empromptu is the build.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, the company said it had raised $2 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Precursor Ventures. Zeal Capital, Alumni Ventures, FoundersEdge, and South Loop also participated. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leven said the fresh capital will be used for hiring staff and developing new proprietary technology. It also announced three new features, including the ability to create custom data models and infinite memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is hoping to target businesses launching in regulated industries or “deeply complex” areas that involve capturing data and creating applications — software that services hotels, for example.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Leven hopes that founders feel their businesses can be transformed without having to learn the technical skills to take advantage of the AI revolution.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s just like any other skill,” Leven said. “And the beauty of this skill is that AI can help you learn it along the way.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to clarify what Empromptu does. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The agency also ordered Zuckerman to delete all the data collected by SpyFone, as well as to undergo frequent audits and establish certain cybersecurity practices for his businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“SpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,” said Samuel Levine, then acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company’s slipshod security.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2025-0198-0001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In his petition</a>, Zuckerman claimed that the FTC order’s security requirements have made it harder for him to run his other businesses due to financial costs, despite the fact that Support King is no longer in operation and he now only runs a restaurant and plans other “tourism ventures” in Puerto Rico, according to the petition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached via email, Zuckerman declined to comment and referred questions to his lawyer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FTC ban stemmed from an incident in 2018, when <a href=\"http://vice.com/en/article/spyware-company-spyfone-terabytes-data-exposed-online-leak/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a security researcher found an Amazon S3 bucket belonging to SpyFone</a> that left extremely sensitive data — including selfies, text messages, chat app messages, audio recordings, contacts, location, hashed passwords and logins, and more — exposed online for anyone to see and access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposed data included 44,109 unique email addresses and, according to the researcher who found the breach, “at least 2,208 current ‘customers’ and hundreds or thousands of photos and audio in each folder” from 3,666 phones that had the SpyFone stalkerware installed on them.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about stalkerware makers?

In 2022, TechCrunch received a trove of breached data from stalkerware app SpyTrac. The data revealed that SpyTrac was run by freelance developers with direct ties to Support King, in what appeared to be an attempt to circumvent the FTC’s ban. Furthermore, the breached data included records from SpyFone, which Zuckerman was ordered to delete, and keys to access the cloud storage of OneClickMonitor, another one of his stalkerware apps. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eva Galperin, a prominent expert on stalkerware, celebrated the news. “Mr. Zuckerman was clearly hoping that if he laid low for a few years, everyone would forget about the reasons why the FTC issued a ban not only against the company, but against him specifically,” Galperin told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch’s revelation in 2022 that Zuckerman apparently violated the FTC ban, “suggests that Zuckerman did not learn his lesson,” added Galperin, who is the director of cybersecurity at the digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stalkerware apps allow their customers to surreptitiously spy on the phones and devices of their loved ones. In addition to enabling potentially illegal activities, for the last eight years, there have been at least 26 stalkerware companies that have been hacked or left sensitive data exposed online, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to TechCrunch’s tally</a>.

The company has secured strategic partnerships with LG CNS and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to develop its ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investor interest in AI robotics has been steadily growing. Physical Intelligence, another company developing “brains” for a broad range of robots, has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-20/robotics-startup-physical-intelligence-valued-at-5-6-billion-in-new-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> recently raised $600 million at a $5.6 billion valuation led by CapitalG. One investor who evaluated but declined to fund Physical Intelligence told TechCrunch that its model is still in the early stages of development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, Figure, a company developing a humanoid robot, raised more than $1 billion at a massive <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">$39 billion valuation</a>. Meanwhile, 1X, another humanoid robot developer, was in talks to secure as much as $1 billion at a <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/humanoid-robot-developer-1x-targets-1-billion-new-funding?rc=em6blq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$10 billion valuation</a>, The Information reported several months ago.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Now, we have a firmer grasp on those weekly ride numbers, thanks to a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management to it investors that was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/tiger-global-new-fund-ai-valuations.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported by CNBC</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter was an appeal for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/tiger-global-plans-cautious-venture-future-with-a-new-2-2b-fund/\">investment into Tiger Global’s next venture capital fund</a> and called out the gains, so far, of its current fund. Those gains rested largely on its investments in hot companies like OpenAI, Databricks, and Waymo. In the letter, Tiger disclosed that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week — nearly double the amount it disclosed this spring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That number will rise as the company continues its aggressive rollout strategy, too. Waymo, which provides commercial robotaxi service in five cities, has announced plans to launch in 12 additional cities in 2026, including Dallas, Denver, Houston, Nashville, and San Diego.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Waymo spokesperson declined to comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
