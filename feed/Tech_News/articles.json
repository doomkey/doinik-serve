The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders – Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett – will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Convogo’s product will be wound down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real world outcomes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem – as in the case of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/openai-buys-sky-an-ai-interface-for-mac/\">Sky</a>, the AI interface for Mac, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/openai-acquires-product-testing-startup-statsig-and-shakes-up-its-leadership-team/\">Statsig</a>, a product testing firm – or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI – as in the cases of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/with-its-latest-acqui-hire-openai-is-doubling-down-on-personalized-consumer-ai/\">Roi</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/openai-hires-team-behind-gv-backed-ai-eval-platform-context-ai/\">Context.ai</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/openai-hires-team-behind-ai-recommendation-startup-crossing-minds/\">Crossing Minds</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Convogo deal also signals that OpenAI, like its competitors, is using M&amp;A as a talent and capability accelerator. The main exception to that rule is OpenAI’s acquisition of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">Jonny Ive’s io Products</a>, which is continuing its product roadmap as the two companies work together to create a piece of AI hardware. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Palmer-Luckey-CES.jpg?resize=1200,900",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You might think it’s pretty weird to hear the founders of a VR company and a social media platform publicly complaining about how things used to be better back in the dial-up days. Nevertheless, that is what happened at CES on Wednesday, when Oculus creator Palmer Luckey and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian gave a joint talk about the joys of “tech nostalgia.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luckey, who initially made his fortune in VR and now runs the defense contractor Anduril, and Ohanian both seemed to agree: Stuff was better in the old days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The catch, however, is that Luckey and Ohanian weren’t really criticizing technology itself (Luckey said, during his remarks, that he supported AI and felt it was changing workflows for the better); instead, they were criticizing the aesthetics of technology. Vintage consumer tech products, they argued, are superior to today’s — and it’s the styles and form factor of the past that will determine tech’s future, they claimed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not just about nostalgia for the old; it’s about the fact that it’s just objectively better,” Ohanian said of some older products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After going on a short tirade about how great the 1999 first-person shooter Quake: Arena is, Luckey similarly sang the praises of old-school media. “There is something that used to exist in the intentionality of building a music library — whether that was building whole albums or building mix tapes,” Luckey said, adding that, in the era of endless downloads, you clearly “lose something.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luckey also pointed to younger people who are nostalgic for time periods that they don’t even remember or have any personal connection to. “Why do they think it’s good? It’s not because they’re remembering their childhoods. It’s not because they’re harkening back to some earlier time. It’s because they’re recognizing that it is literally better, some of this old stuff.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Certain consumer trends would seem to suggest that Luckey and Ohanian are on to something. Nostalgia is obviously big across the board these days (look at all those 1980s period pieces coming out of Hollywood), but <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/17/gen-z-fashion-nostalgia-retro-tech-backlash-millennials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nostalgic tech design</a> is a particularly thriving niche. Young people are overwhelmed and oversaturated by the internet. As a result, many have developed new interests in physical media — like collecting cassettes and vinyl. Meanwhile, new, low-tech devices with retro designs are also seeing an uptick in interest (just check out the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/clicks-debuts-its-own-take-on-the-blackberry-smartphone-plus-a-79-snap-on-mobile-keyboard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Clicks Communicator phone</a> that debuted at CES this year).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that consumer interests are trending this direction, Luckey and Ohanian’s enthusiasm for vintage tech could also just end up being a savvy business strategy. That is, if Americans are feeling nostalgic, you might as well monetize it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, Luckey has already been doing this. The defense contractor, who sports <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/09/nx-s1-4985981/oculus-ai-weapons-ukraine-palmer-luckey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an ’80s mullet</a>, launched a project in 2024 called <a href=\"https://modretro.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooGeFXSVv8DS_7E1zSMRvpBXkwjWeyy54HAl5CL0eZ1mDqLzVdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ModRetro Chromatic</a> — a Game Boy-like device that retails for $199, allows gameplay of old cartridge classics from the 1990s, and has been called one of “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the best ever made</a>” of its kind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, Ohanian brought one of the ModRetro units onstage and proudly showed it off to the crowd. Ohanian, who has spoken very publicly about his love for Luckey’s gaming company, has also said he’s interested in creating his own vintage-style game.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were a lot of colorful moments during Wednesday’s talk, most of which were generated by Luckey. At one point, he shared that he had been coming to CES since he was 16. Astute CES fans will note: You’re supposed to be 18 to get in. “I used a fake ID,” Luckey told a CES audience on Wednesday, to much laughter. “I pretended that I worked for a company that was exhibiting here,” the mogul said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cute retro games may be the future but so, too, is war, it would seem. Since 2017, Luckey has largely been focused on his defense startup Anduril. Earlier this year, in the wake of a Series G fundraising round, the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anduril-raises-2-5b-at-30-5b-valuation-led-by-founders-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">valuation swelled to $30.5 billion</a>. Lately, the company has been collaborating with Meta on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/in-a-victory-for-palmer-luckey-meta-and-anduril-work-on-mixed-reality-headsets-for-the-military/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">headsets for the U.S. military</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anduril hardly came up during Wednesday’s talk, but toward the end of the conversation, Luckey pivoted briefly to a discussion about foreign policy to make some characteristically wild claims. “I was part of the problem for a long time, making all of my stuff in China,” he said. “Geopolitically, the United States and China are going through a divorce; it’s a messy divorce — and if people think that it’s going to end with reconciliation, they’re blind. It’s not,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Disney made the announcement at its Tech + Data Showcase event at CES 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said in a blog post that the experience “will evolve as it expands across news and entertainment and delivers a more personalized, dynamic experience that reinforces Disney+ as a must-visit daily destination.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Disney told <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2026/01/disney-plus-vertical-videos-ces-1236665836/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Deadline</a> that the videos could include original short-form content, repurposed social clips, scenes from TV shows or movies, or a combination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re obviously thinking about integrating vertical video in ways that are native to core user behaviors,” Erin Teague, EVP of Product Management for Disney Entertainment and ESPN, told Deadline. “So, it won’t be a kind of a disjointed, random experience.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as Disney launched a personalized vertical video feed in the ESPN app last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By introducing short-form video content to Disney+, the company is targeting younger users who are accustomed to watching quick clips on their phones rather than long-form content like TV shows and movies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Disney+ won’t be the first streamer to explore vertical video, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-is-getting-into-short-videos-with-a-new-vertical-feed-for-mobile/\">Netflix launched a vertical feed</a> last year that lets users scroll through clips from its original titles.<br></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

(Observability platforms help companies monitor their software systems and data for performance issues and bugs.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cloud data company announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Observe, subject to regulatory approval, on January 8. Snowflake will integrate Observe’s product into its own to give customers a unified place to collect and store their telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces from software systems) and better spot potential bugs and issues in their data and software.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Observe was founded in 2017 by Jacob Leverich, Jonathan Trevor, and Ang Li and launched its first observability product built on a centralized Snowflake database in 2018. The company was incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures and has since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/observe-continues-to-adapt-to-the-changing-world-of-software-observability/\">raised nearly $500 million in venture capital</a> from firms including Snowflake Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Madrona, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, both Snowflake and Observe were incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures, with Sutter Hill managing director Mike Speiser serving as Snowflake’s founding CEO from 2012 to 2014.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jeremy Burton, the current CEO of Observe, has served on Snowflake’s board of directors since 2015.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Integrating Observe into Snowflake allows users to proactively monitor their data stack and spot and fix issues 10x faster than before, according to a <a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-announces-intent-to-acquire-observe-to-deliver-ai-powered-observability-at-enterprise-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Snowflake blog post</a> — a task that has become harder to scale due to the sheer volume of data generated by AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition also creates a unified framework for telemetry data, which is automatically collected, built on Apache Iceberg and OpenTelemetry architectures.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

TechCrunch has reached out to Snowflake for more information on the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year saw a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/ai-is-forcing-the-data-industry-to-consolidate-but-thats-not-the-whole-story/\">wave of consolidation</a> in the data industry as data companies looked to build out their product offerings to make themselves more attractive one-stop-shop partners in the age of AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal could be a sign that data company consolidation will continue in 2026.

He resigned from the board in 2018 after his bid to take over as CEO was rejected by the other co-founders, who put Altman up for the job. Officially, Musk cited potential conflicts of interest with Tesla’s own AI development for self-driving cars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since leaving OpenAI, he’s been a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/30/elon-musk-files-for-injunction-to-halt-openais-transition-to-a-for-profit/\">vocal critic</a> of the firm’s transition to a for-profit model, and even made an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/elon-musk-led-team-submits-97-4b-bid-for-openai/\">unsolicited $97.4 billion bid</a> to buy OpenAI in February 2025, which Altman rejected. OpenAI, which was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, first began to move away from its pure nonprofit roots in 2019 by creating a for-profit subsidiary with a “capped-profit” model that limited investor returns. This was designed to help OpenAI raise the massive amounts of funding it needed to scale and attract top talent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s lawsuit was unable to stop OpenAI from converting into a nonprofit, and in October 2025, the corporation <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/openai-completes-its-for-profit-recapitalization/\">completed its formal restructuring process</a>. The for-profit branch became a Public Benefit Corporation, with the original nonprofit retaining a 26% equity stake. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk is now seeking monetary damages from what he says are “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI. He says he invested about $38 million in early funding, as well as guidance and credibility, based on assurances that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch Musk’s lawsuit is “baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said her decision was based on evidence suggesting OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure would be maintained, as Musk alleges. A jury trial for March has been tentatively scheduled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated with commentary from OpenAI.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For the past couple of years, most AI investment has focused on winning over enterprise customers, who provide fat checks, multi-year contracts, and quick paths to scale.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But one VC sees the consumer sector gearing up for a comeback in 2026. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is gonna be the year of the consumer,” said Vanessa Larco, partner at the venture firm Premise and a former partner at NEA, on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/investing-in-the-consumer-ai-products-openai-wont-want-to-kill/\">this week’s episode</a> of the Equity podcast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says that even though enterprises have big budgets and a frantic desire to implement AI solutions, adoption often stalls because “they don’t know where to start.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fun thing about consumer and prosumer…is that people already have in mind what they want to use it for,” Larco continued. “And so they purchase it, and if it meets the need, they just keep using it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, adoption is quicker, and startups building AI products don’t have to guess whether they’ve actually achieved product-market fit or have just won a contract. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re selling to consumers, you’ll know very quickly if it’s fitting a need or not, and you’ll know quickly whether you need to pivot or make some changes to your product or totally scrap it and start something totally different,” Larco said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And in today’s anxiety-inducing economy, consumer tech products that manage to scale demonstrate an especially strong product-market fit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are early indications that consumer tech is having a moment. Late last year, OpenAI launched apps in ChatGPT, allowing users to shop with the Target app, scour the housing market with Zillow, book trips with Expedia, or make a Spotify playlist, all through the ChatGPT chatbot experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is gonna feel like concierge-like services, which will do everything for you that you have in mind,” Larco said. “The question is, which of it should be specialized, and which should be general purpose?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or put differently, as OpenAI works to make ChatGPT the new operating system of the consumer internet, which legacy companies — like Tripadvisor or WebMD — will continue to exist in their own right, and which will get eaten by OpenAI?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Larco does think 2026 is going to be a “gangbuster” year for M&amp;A, she’s interested in investing in startups that “OpenAI isn’t going to want to kill.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI doesn’t manage real-world assets,” she said. “I don’t think they’ll build an Airbnb competitor because I don’t think they’re gonna want to manage homes…I don’t think they’re going to build any of these marketplaces that require real humans because they don’t want to manage the humans.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from which startups can fill the gaps, Larco is watching out for what happens if OpenAI “decides to pull an Apple or Android where they take a 30% cut of all the traffic they send you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Is Airbnb gonna want to play ball with that?” she asked. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Larco predicts new monetization strategies and fresh business models will emerge from the evolved consumer experience online. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-social-has-to-change\"><strong>“Social has to change”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While doomscrolling on Instagram about Trump’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Larco noticed something. She had come to the platform to get news on the escalating crisis, but instead she was overwhelmingly flooded with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/technology/nicolas-maduro-ai-images-deepfakes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI-generated Maduro slop</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While deepfakes have been steadily becoming mainstream on social media, this was one of the first major news events where AI-generated slop muddied the waters of the truth. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At that point, I was like, if I’m just gonna be watching AI-generated videos and photos, I want it to be funny,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says she has been inundated with enough realistic-looking AI videos on social media that she just assumes it’s all AI at this point, and she’s not alone. If we all start to assume that nothing we see on Meta’s platforms or TikTok is real anymore, the question will be, where do you get the real stuff?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says others might fill in the gaps of where to find truthful, non-AI content as platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/reddit-will-tighten-verification-to-keep-out-human-like-ai-bots/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/digg-founder-kevin-rose-on-the-need-for-trusted-social-communities-in-the-ai-era/\">Digg</a> make moves to verify humanity. But for Meta? Maybe it just becomes an entertainment company, a platform for user-generated short films.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we should move on from getting your news from [Meta],” Larco said. “You are just getting funny videos from there. It’s not social media. It’s just gaming and entertainment media.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-some-things-are-better-with-voice-than-a-screen\"><strong>“Some things are better with voice than a screen</strong>“</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047721\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Meta Ray-Ban display</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta / Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/\">Meta acquired AI agent startup Manus</a> last week, many saw it as an enterprise play. Larco thinks it could be a move geared at improving Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a product the VC is a huge fan of because they allow her to answer phone calls, respond to messages, take photos and videos, and ask Meta AI questions, all without having to pull out her phone and navigate a screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says she thinks truly useful voice AI assistants are finally “on the cusp of happening,” fueled by more advanced tech and more robust compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some things are better with voice than a screen,” she said. “And because voice sucked, we needed the screen as a crutch. But I would love to start separating out what things are really better on a screen and what things are just better with audio.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Getting answers to questions her kids ask about what the tallest building is? Definitely voice. Taking out her phone to type in the question now feels “archaic,” Larco said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it’ll be really fun for designers because they finally get to pick and choose what form factor is better for what use cases,” she said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Although he declined to share sales numbers, he said that over the past week, the company was making a sale every 6.5 seconds between both devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the prototype we tried was not a fully functional phone, it’s the same size and weight as the device that’s preparing to ship later this year, giving an initial feel for what it would be like to use the Communicator. Onboard storage lands at 256 gigabytes, with expandable microSD storage of up to 2 terabytes of data. The device will also sport a 4000mAh silicon-carbon battery and is currently weighing in around 170 grams (or 6 oz). Underneath the back is where your nano-SIM card will go. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phone also comes with interchangeable back covers that you can pop off to change its look.

Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where the device’s light-up side button can help. Called the “Signal Light,” the button can be configured to glow with different colors or patterns when you receive messages from certain people, groups, or apps. So you can be sure to respond if it’s your boss or the kids contacting you and ignore less important notifications.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg\" alt=\"a screenshot showing a close-up of the lit-up button on the side of the Clicks Communicator. it's featuring a red lit-up button to show messages from certain people, and different colors for other people or types of messages that the user can prioritize.\" class=\"wp-image-3079419\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Clicks</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tactile, physical keys feel good, though the prototype’s version may actually be a little less “clicky” than the final product.

This is simply a new view you can toggle in and out of as you please to cut through the noise of your incoming mail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is rolling out the AI Inbox feature to trusted testers before making it more broadly available in the coming months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new AI Overviews in Gmail search, users can now search their inbox using natural language questions to get a quick answer instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080899\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI-powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says all of Gmail’s AI features are optional, that it doesn’t use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it’s designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure.

Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traffic flowing through Spangle’s platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the core of Spangle’s approach is a simple idea: Instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle’s AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080991\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/spangle-ai.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spangle</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer’s catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spangle’s software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer’s vice president of performance marketing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one-click checkout company Bolt</a> and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle’s focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spangle’s approach also aligns with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/openai-and-perplexity-are-launching-ai-shopping-assistants-but-competing-startups-arent-sweating-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools</a> such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/openai-upgrades-chatgpt-search-with-shopping-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a> and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said, those changes made it possible to replace incremental fixes with an AI-native commerce system that can adapt instantly as shopping behavior evolves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Spangle has six full-time employees, underscoring how AI tools are allowing startups to scale enterprise software with relatively small teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the fresh funding, Kuruvilla said Spangle plans to invest further in research and development, expand its engineering team, and build out its sales organization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And now, before this robotaxi joins Waymo’s official commercial fleet, it’s getting a new name, the company told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Zeekr RT robotaxi will now be named Ojai (pronounced “oh-hi”) — after the village in the Topatopa Mountains above Los Angeles that is known for its arts community and focus on wellness. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s official explanation, per spokesperson Chris Bonelli, is that the company determined the U.S. public isn’t familiar with the Zeekr brand. That branding may even carry through to the rider experience. Apparently, when customers eventually get into the Ojai, the robotaxi will greet them with an “Oh hi” and their name. Cute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, in the U.S. it might not hurt to ditch the name of a Chinese automaker either. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those unfamiliar, Waymo first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/waymo-partners-with-geely-to-make-electric-avs-for-ride-hail-in-the-us/\">struck a partnership</a> with Geely Holding Group-owned Zeekr in 2021. Waymo showed off a concept of a purpose-built robotaxi the following year at a splashy event in Los Angeles. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/inside-the-waymo-zeekr-robotaxi-bird-spirals-and-layoffs-come-to-nuro/\">prototype</a> was based on a version of Zeekr’s  SEA-M architecture designed for “future mobility products” like robotaxis and logistics vehicles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the prototype didn’t have a steering wheel. But the Ojai one, which was shown off at CES 2026, does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Zeekr RT (now Ojai) has gone through some fine-tuning over the years as it has gone through development and testing in cities like Phoenix and San Francisco. Last year at CES, Waymo gave the robotaxi the now-retired name of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/zeekr-rt-the-robotaxi-built-for-waymo-has-the-tiniest-wipers/\">Zeekr RT</a> and showcased some of its hardware, including 13 cameras, four lidar, six radar, an array of external audio receivers, and the tiniest sensor wipers you’ve ever seen. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That hardware suite is the same. But the paint color has been tweaked, according to the company. Waymo told TechCrunch the paint color, which had a blueish tint, is now more silver. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of these final tweaks have happened ahead of Ojai’s imminent launch into commercial service. Waymo employees, and their family and friends, are now able to hail the Zeekr van in San Francisco and Phoenix — typically one of the last steps before it becomes available to the public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is in the midst of a rapid expansion. The company, which offers a commercial robotaxi service in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, plans to launch in a dozen more cities over the next year. Those cities include Denver, Las Vegas, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/waymo-plans-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-london-in-2026/\">London</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

His mother, Megan Garcia, has told the Senate that companies must be “legally accountable when they knowingly design harmful AI technologies that kill kids.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another lawsuit describes a 17-year-old whose chatbot encouraged self-harm and suggested that murdering his parents was reasonable for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/10/nx-s1-5222574/kids-character-ai-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">limiting screen time</a>.

The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable — ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wednesday’s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn’t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called “Great Minds” that was meant to “explore the intersection of technology and humanity.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like “how many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?” But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is rolling the assistant out to its <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/support/category/ford-app/?srsltid=AfmBOopidMSYEhMEboUFbAYtkVT8RMBrMC3OW1Wf0fLVgvCZmyqYMGgM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">newly revamped Ford app</a> in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn’t specify which models it’s prioritizing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford didn’t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it’s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company’s low-cost “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford is promising more with this next-generation BlueCruise system, including eyes-off driving in 2028.

Indeed, many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young and include college dropouts like Mercor’s founder, Brendan Foody.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bonatsos is also interested in investing in founders who are launching consumer businesses, a sector he views as “underappreciated” in a market saturated with enterprise-focused AI startups.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although General Catalyst has transitioned into what it calls an “<a href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investment and transformation company</a>,” it is continuing to make seed-stage bets.

However, after working with LinkedIn over the past two weeks — and addressing the social network’s concerns — Artisan is now being reinstated. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “Every startup inevitably has some kind of thing that comes back to bite them [from things] that they do early on,” Carmichael-Jack said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Contrary to what the rumors in the viral posts said, LinkedIn did not ban the company because its AI agents were spamming users. LinkedIn did, however, object to the startup using LinkedIn’s name on its website and also alleged that the company was using data brokers who had scraped the site without permission, Carmichael-Jack said. Data scraping is a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#rights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">violation of LinkedIn’s terms of service</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Artisan AI is a graduate of startup accelerator Y Combinator and became one of San Francisco’s buzziest startups via <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its “Stop hiring humans” billboards posted</a> around town. Artisan offers an AI agent it calls Ava that does outbound sales by finding and contacting potential customers. LinkedIn is famously precious turf for outbound marketing salespeople — both human and, increasingly, AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a couple of LinkedIn users seemed to notice <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sidharthrajaram_they-actually-wont-be-coming-into-work-at-activity-7410780466460569601-oQlP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Artisan’s ban about a week ago</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-sdr-artisan-linkedin-ban-debate-what-likely-happened-jakub-mach-dgzwf/?trackingId=llmy04HWQOaxJJ6%2FFPkdgw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posts</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/systemsluke/status/2008887364568178736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tweets</a> about it really picked up steam this week. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Carmichael-Jack explained that LinkedIn’s “enforcement team reached out to us, and they basically restricted our accounts completely, so we disappeared from the platform whilst they were reviewing it, which was not ideal. But it was kind of funny, because once we were restricted, our lead flow suddenly started inching up every day. And I think it’s because, obviously, so many people were posting about it.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a founder who likes a good guerrilla marketing scheme, he joked, “I wish we’d done it on purpose.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The truth was he was shocked to get an email from LinkedIn on Friday evening, December 19, right before the Christmas holiday. Carmichael-Jack described the team handling the ban as helpful and responsive, even if they were also anonymous and only reachable by email. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To appease LinkedIn, Artisan removed all mentions of LinkedIn from its website. It was using the name to compare some of its data features to LinkedIn’s. The CEO also got a crash course in third-party vendor verification, ensuring that his data partners were operating in compliance with LinkedIn’s policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Carmichael-Jack is happy to be back on the Microsoft-owned social network, he downplayed how damaging being booted off would have been, saying very little of the data Artisan uses comes from the site. He’s also about to release a new version of the agent that is more autonomous and can use more channels for contacting prospects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can work around anything. We’re launching dialing as a channel in a few months — outbound calling,” so if the LinkedIn ban could not have been reversed, “it wouldn’t be the end of the world,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, LinkedIn isn’t a direct competitor. It did launch its first AI agent <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/ai/how-we-engineered-linkedins-hiring-assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last year called Hiring Assistant</a>, but it is focused on recruiting. Still, that LinkedIn went nuclear on Artisan could signal that a sales agent could one day be in its pipeline, too. LinkedIn did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In any case, Artisan’s very public banning can be seen as a warning for all agentic players looking for sources of data: Big Tech is watching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Launched last August, the $2.99 per month streaming service offers ad-free access to library content, at a time when rival streamers are raising their prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The opportunity for Howdy was — if you just look at what’s going on in the streaming world with streaming services, they’re getting more expensive. They keep raising prices, and they keep adding larger and larger ad loads,” Wood explained at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES. “And so, the part of the market where it actually started — low-cost and no ads — is gone now. There’s no streaming services that address that portion of the market.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec also suggested that Roku intends to bring Howdy to a broader market than just Roku customers, saying that while it started on Roku, the company “will take it off-platform as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked to clarify offstage if that meant mobile apps, the web, and elsewhere, Wood told TechCrunch the company has not yet said where, specifically, it plans to bring Howdy, but that “we want to distribute it everywhere.”  That seems to suggest that Howdy could be an app that you one day load on any device, large or small. Wood declined to share subscriber numbers with TechCrunch, but said onstage, “I think if I just look at the market, it’s going to be a big streaming service.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
