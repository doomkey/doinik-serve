He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\">replacing human labor</a> as a way to price it, and justify its expense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/ai-job-predictions-become-corporate-americas-newest-competitive-sport/\">could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs</a>, raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ln3PTyByci0\">an interview on 60 Minutes</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">checking the AI’s work for accuracy</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/\">Project Iceberg</a>, which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/#faq\">how much of a job can be offloaded to AI</a>. It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/report.pdf\">tasks it cites as examples</a> include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39\">Blood in the Machine</a>. Then there are the high unemployment rates among <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/10/the-computer-science-dream-has-become-a-nightmare/\">new grad junior coders</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/isg_vemo_2026.pdf\">Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report</a> found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/microsoft-satya-nadella-memo-layoffs.html\">over 15,000 people in 2025</a>, even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html#:~:text=Financially%2C%20it%20was%20a%20year,We%20take%20neither%20for%20granted.\">last fiscal year, which closed in June</a> — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/\"> public memo</a> about the layoffs after these results. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-says-companys-mission-193700847.html\">did say</a> that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 AI is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/ai-job-cuts-amazon-microsoft-and-more-cite-ai-for-2025-layoffs.html\">CNBC reported.</a> That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft and other tech companies chasing AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses</a>, too.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, the companies said the robotaxi is already being tested on public roads ahead of a planned commercial service launching in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Built on a Lucid Gravity SUV, the robotaxi has high-resolution cameras, solid state lidar sensors, and radars integrated into the body and the roof-mounted “halo.” The autonomy package is powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computer. That halo also has integrated LED lights that will help riders identify their vehicle (similar to how Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs work). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, all of this extra tech is added to the Gravity as it’s being built at Lucid Motors’ Casa Grande, Arizona factory, saving the companies some time and money. By comparison, Waymo currently has to take apart the I-Pace SUVs it receives from Jaguar and integrate the autonomous tech as it puts them back together. (Future Waymo vehicles are planned to be more purpose-built.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080009\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg 3713w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vehicle unveiled on Monday is a more polished-up version of the test version that the three companies have spent the last seven months showing off in press photos. The newest element revealed at CES has to do with how users will interface with the Uber-Lucid-Nuro robotaxi. That includes a small screen on the halo meant to greet riders and a ride interface inside the cabin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone who has ridden in a Waymo will find this UI experience familiar. The rear passenger screen shows an isometric graphical view of the robotaxi moving through city streets, with representations of nearby cars and pedestrians. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies did not have an interactive version of the software — which is being created by Uber — ready to test out just yet. But it has been built to show the standard information like estimated drop-off time, how much ride time is remaining, and climate and music controls. There are also buttons to reach rider support and to tell the robotaxi to pull over.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The front passenger screen shows a lot of the same information, just on a larger central touchscreen display. In the demonstration car on display at the Fontainebleau hotel, a lot of the same elements appeared on the Gravity’s sweeping 34-inch curved OLED display, which sits behind the steering wheel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber chose to build this forthcoming “premium” robotaxi service around the Gravity, and at a high level it seems like a wise decision. The Gravity is immensely spacious inside, especially in the two-row configuration on display at the hotel. (Uber says a three-row version will be available, too.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the Gravity’s first full year came with struggles. Lucid fought with software issues as it ramped up production of the SUV, and the problems got bad enough that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to owners in December apologizing for the “frustrations” they experienced. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid has seemingly been able to bounce back from that, and on Monday announced that it doubled its 2024 production figures and reached new sales records. Time will tell if the robotaxi version has any of the same kinds of software struggles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber, Lucid, and Nuro said Monday that once final validation is complete on the robotaxi later this year, true production versions will start rolling off Lucid’s factory lines in Arizona. The companies did not give a concrete timeline for that, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

GR00T relies on Cosmos Reason as its brain, and it unlocks whole-body control for humanoids so they can move and handle objects simultaneously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia also introduced Isaac Lab-Arena at CES, an open-source simulation framework hosted on GitHub that serves as another component of the company’s physical AI platform, enabling safe virtual testing of robotic capabilities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The platform promises to address a critical industry challenge: as robots learn increasingly complex tasks, from precise object handling to cable installation, validating these abilities in physical environments can be costly, slow, and risky. Isaac Lab-Arena tackles this by consolidating resources, task scenarios, training tools, and established benchmarks like Libero, RoboCasa, and RoboTwin, creating a unified standard where the industry previously lacked one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Supporting the ecosystem is Nvidia OSMO, an open-source command center that serves as connective infrastructure that integrates the entire workflow from data generation through training across both desktop and cloud environments. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to help power it all, there’s the new Blackwell-powered Jetson T4000 graphics card, the newest member of the Thor family. Nvidia is pitching it as a cost-effective on-device compute upgrade that delivers 1200 teraflops of AI compute and 64 gigabytes of memory while running efficiently at 40 to 70 watts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia is also deepening its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-teams-up-with-hugging-face-to-offer-cloud-based-ai-training/\">partnership with Hugging Face</a> to let more people experiment with robot training without needing expensive hardware or specialized knowledge. The collaboration integrates Nvidia’s Isaac and GR00T technologies into Hugging Face’s LeRobot framework, connecting Nvidia’s 2 million robotics developers with Hugging Face’s 13 million AI builders. The developer platform’s open-source <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/14/hugging-face-buys-a-humanoid-robotics-startup/\">Reachy 2</a> humanoid now works directly with Nvidia’s Jetson Thor chip, letting developers experiment with different AI models without being locked into proprietary systems.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger picture here is that Nvidia is trying to make robotics development more accessible, and it wants to be the underlying hardware and software vendor powering it, much like Android is the default for smartphone makers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are early signs that Nvidia’s strategy is working. Robotics is the fastest growing category on Hugging Face, with Nvidia’s models leading downloads. Meanwhile robotics companies from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar to Franka Robots and NEURA Robotics are already using Nvidia’s tech.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Explaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/tensormesh-raises-4-5m-to-squeeze-more-inference-out-of-ai-server-loads/\">a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs</a>. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">between $3 trillion and $4 trillion</a> will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Boston Dynamics’ humanoid robot Atlas will be the first test case, according to Carolina Parada, senior director of robotics at Google DeepMind. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re looking to integrate our cutting-edge AI foundation models with Boston Dynamics’ new Atlas robots, and we’ll aim to develop the world’s most advanced robot foundation model to fulfill the promise of true general-purpose human needs,” Parada said onstage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up comes less than a year after the Google AI research lab announced new AI models called Gemini Robotics that are designed to allow robots to perceive, reason, use tools, and interact with humans. Gemini Robotics is based on a large-scale multimodal generative AI model, Gemini. At the time, Google DeepMind said the robotics AI model was trained to generalize behavior across a range of different robotics hardware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enter Boston Dynamics, and its majority owner, Hyundai Motor Group. While accelerating research will be a central piece of this partnership, this has real-world scaling intent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boston Dynamics already has products, like the quadruped Spot, that are in customers’ hands in more than 40 countries. Its warehouse robot Stretch has unloaded more than 20 million boxes globally since its launch in 2023, according to Hyundai. Now Boston Dynamics and Hyundai are preparing for the next generation, starting with the humanoid robot Atlas, which the company announced Monday is already in production and headed to a Hyundai factory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A prototype of Atlas walked onstage during the press conference, showing off its ability to move. But as Alberto Rodriguez, director of Atlas behavior at Boston Dynamics, noted, making “Atlas into a product requires more than athletic performance for humanoids to really deliver on their promise. They have to be able to interact with people naturally.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rodriguez and his counterparts at Boston Dynamics believe that recent advancements in AI have created a clear path to get to those capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It tells you what action it’s going to take, the reasons by which it came about that action. And then, of course, the trajectory.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alpamayo 1’s underlying code is available on Hugging Face. Developers can fine-tune Alpamayo into smaller, faster versions for vehicle development, use it to train simpler driving systems, or build tools on top of it like auto-labeling systems that automatically tag video data or evaluators that check if a car made a smart decision. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They can also use Cosmos to generate synthetic data and then train and test their Alpamayo-based AV application on the combination of the real and synthetic dataset,” Kani said. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/nvidia-unveils-new-cosmos-world-models-other-infra-for-physical-applications-of-ai/\">Cosmos</a> is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/nvidia-releases-its-own-brand-of-world-models/\">Nvidia’s brand of generative world models</a>, AI systems that create a representation of a physical environment so they can make predictions and take actions. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the Alpamayo rollout, Nvidia is also releasing an open dataset with more than 1,700 hours of driving data collected across a range of geographies and conditions, covering rare and complex real-world scenarios. The company is additionally launching AlpaSim, an open source simulation framework for validating autonomous driving systems. Available on GitHub, AlpaSim is designed to recreate real-world driving conditions, from sensors to traffic, so developers can safely test systems at scale.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Smart Bricks and Minifigures can sense nearby Smart Tags, which are 2×2 studless tiles with unique digital IDs that tell the Bricks and Minifigures how to act.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the Smart Tag comes in a set for building a helicopter, for example, then the Smart Brick will light up and make propeller sounds that would help bring a helicopter to life. Its built-in accelerometer would make these lights and sounds more consistent with how you’re actually playing with the helicopter, since the Brick will be able to sense when the helicopter is zooming through the sky or turned upside down.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079877\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg 6722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/75421_Lifestyle_cons_2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>LEGO</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Smart Bricks are powered by a patented ASIC chip, which is smaller than the size of a single Lego stud. The chip uses near-field magnetic positioning to recognize the Tags around it, as well as a miniature speaker, accelerometer, and LED array. Lego also developed a Bluetooth-based protocol called BrickNet, which allows multiple Smart Bricks to recognize each other and operate in tandem. The company claims that BrickNet is protected by enhanced encryption and privacy controls (all of which is necessary, but imagine a world where hacking into toys wasn’t a concern!).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s no setup required to pair the elements of the Smart Play system, making it easy for kids to get started — and parents will be pleased to note that there are no screens involved in the Smart system at all. However, Lego’s website says that there will be a Smart Tag for animating Lego toilets, so… there’s that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lego’s first two Smart Play sets — which are both Star Wars-themed — will launch on March 1, though preorders open on Friday. The “Luke’s Red Five X-wing” building set will retail for $69.99, while the larger “Throne Room Duel and A-wing” set will cost $159.99. These sets use the Smart Play system to animate characters like Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, allowing them to interact with Smart Tags, which enable Lightsaber duels among other Star Wars-related capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Department of Energy had issued a report that discussed this <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/EXEC-2022-004484%20-%20Report%20to%20Congress%20as%20of%20December%2014%202023%20(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">security concern, as well as solutions to it, in February 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wind turbines’ whirling blades have been known to stymie radar systems, but researchers in the government and private companies have been working to mitigate the problem for well over a decade. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Choosing the precise site for wind energy projects is one of the biggest ways to ameliorate interference. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management coordinates with the Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse to “review each proposed offshore wind project on a project-by-project basis, and would attempt to de-conflict concerns related to individual projects or multiple projects,” according to Vineyard Wind 1’s <a href=\"https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/Vineyard-Wind-1-FEIS-Volume-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">environmental impact statement</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Newer radar systems can filter the noise that wind farms produce through adaptive processing algorithms, Rand Corporation senior engineer Nicholas O’Donoughue <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/trump-admin-halts-6-gw-of-offshore-wind-leases-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">previously told TechCrunch</a>.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chinese lidar-maker Hesai announced plans on Monday to double its production capacity from 2 million units to 4 million units this year, as it looks to corner the global market for the laser-based sensors. That would be well up from the <a href=\"https://www.hesaitech.com/hesai-becomes-the-worlds-first-lidar-company-to-produce-1-million-units-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1 million-plus unit mark that Hesai hit in 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hesai’s push to grab more market share comes just one month after leading U.S. lidar-maker Luminar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That company is not expected to continue operating once its bankruptcy plan is approved, though it is looking to sell the lidar business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hesai has raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the last few years and is now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong stock exchanges. That’s despite fighting an uphill battle against the U.S. government, which has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/chinas-hesai-loses-lawsuit-against-us-government-blacklisting-2025-07-12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">accused the company</a> of working closely with China’s military industry — a charge that Hesai has challenged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Hesai told reporters it was able to double the production target because of “accelerating demand” in the automotive and robotics industries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s automotive efforts have been buoyed by the Chinese car market’s adoption of lidar sensors, which Hesai said is now in 25% of new electric cars sold in the country. It also claimed that many new vehicles in China are expected to integrate between three to six lidar sensors per car, “significantly expanding Hesai’s addressable market.” Hesai boasts 24 automotive customers, including a “top European” automaker, and said it has 4 million orders for its newest ATX lidar sensor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automotive has proved to be a fickle market for lidar sensors outside of China. That was one of the contributing factors to Luminar’s downfall, according to the company’s own bankruptcy filings. While Luminar secured deals to integrate its lidar sensors on Volvo, Polestar, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles, those plans fell apart. Volvo had at one point agreed to buy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1.1 million lidar sensors from Luminar</a>, but delays to its new vehicle programs and cost overruns caused the Swedish automaker to back out of the deal. (Volvo ultimately only purchased around 10,000 sensors from Luminar.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robotics is not guaranteed to be a successful market for lidar sensors, but some players besides Hesai see great promise. San Francisco-based Ouster, which acquired rival player Velodyne in 2023 as the lidar industry began to consolidate, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827801-ouster-taking-profits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has said it believes</a> robotics represents a $14 billion market opportunity. This includes not just humanoid robotics, but last-mile delivery robots and military applications.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES, Hesai is showcasing a robotic lawnmower and a robotic dog that use the company’s JT series lidar sensor. The company also hinted at its inclusion in humanoid robots as well. It has struck deals to provide lidar sensors to autonomous vehicle companies like Pony AI, Motional, WeRide, and Baidu.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hesai also boasted it has helped drive down the cost of lidar sensors by 99.5% in just eight years. That, too, was a contributing factor to Luminar’s downfall; “pressure to reduce costs due to lower price points of China-based competitors” has been regularly listed in the company’s bankruptcy filings as the second-most important factor that explains why the U.S. company found it so hard to build up a self-sustaining business.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This will be the first vehicle to come with Amazon’s next-generation voice assistant, the companies announced during the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch is one part of Amazon’s effort to bring its LLM-powered voice and digital assistant to every device — whether handheld or in the driver’s seat — touched by consumers. Alexa+ is already in more than 600 million devices. And automotive is next on the list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bringing a custom version of Alexa+ into the BMW iX3 will be an important test for Amazon. Automakers have struggled for years to bring a voice assistant inside vehicles that can handle complex functions and requests that don’t end with the driver yelling in frustration. Efforts to develop natural language processing — a form of AI that lets computers understand and respond to human speech — have been in the works for more than a decade. And while progress has been made, these systems can still be easily stumped by humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">BMW and Amazon’s Alexa+ partnership has been three years in the making.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">BMW announced in 2022 that Amazon Alexa would be the foundation of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/bmw-will-use-amazon-alexa-to-build-its-next-voice-assistant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">next-generation voice assistant</a>. This meant BMW wouldn’t just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/bmw-to-bring-alexa-to-its-cars-starting-in-2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">embed Alexa</a> into its vehicles but would also use Amazon’s technology platform known as Alexa Custom Assistant to build its own custom version. That timeline was extended as Amazon worked on an automotive version of Alexa+, an overhauled voice assistant developed and powered by large language models that promises to deliver seamless and natural conversations, like talking to a human.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ was built using Amazon Bedrock, a service that lets AWS customers build apps using generative AI models from Amazon and other third-party partners. Customers, like BMW, can then customize the app with their proprietary data.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The end result, according to Amazon, is a voice assistant that can break down complex requests, reason through steps, and take actions across different services. For instance, Amazon says users can start a conversation with their Alexa+-enabled Echo speaker in the home and continue it in their BMW. Once in the car, the user can make requests through the Alexa+ assistant that might normally require opening up different apps, like music, navigation, and a home security system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s more than Lucid built at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory in the first half of the year. Lucid also said it delivered — meaning sold — 15,841 vehicles across the whole year, a 55% increase over 2024’s figures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stronger finish to 2025 sets Lucid up for an all-important year that will see the company start building the first vehicle on its new mid-sized EV platform. The company has said this first vehicle will cost around $50,000, putting it near the same part of the market as the Tesla Model Y and Rivian’s upcoming R2 SUV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers still pale in comparison to the projections Lucid Motors threw around when it went public in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/lucid-motors-2024-guidance-2023-results-gravity-suv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a $4 billion reverse merger in 2021</a>.

The company particularly struggled in early 2025 as it started to ramp up production of the Gravity SUV. It has since been dealing with a number of quality issues on the vehicle, to the level that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to customers in December saying that he <a href=\"https://lucidowners.com/threads/email-from-marc-lucid-this-morning.14420/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared</a> in their “frustration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Lingering software problems have unfortunately affected our customers’ experience and satisfaction.

This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show’s square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content. The idea is that people may want to browse for something to watch on their phones instead of just having one person drive the content discovery and search experience with the remote.</p>\n\n<figure

The display is also thin, at one-and-a-half inches, and has a matte screen finish to reduce glare.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The TVs also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Wi-Fi 6.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079595\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png 8000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Amazon-Ember-Artline-Art-3.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the big selling point is the 10 different frame options you can choose from, offering a variety of colors, textures, and geometries.

On Monday, at the start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Related to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a back seat.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?w=335\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079554\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=768,1560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=591,1200 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=630,1280 630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=212,430 212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=354,720 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=443,900 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=394,800 394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=756,1536 756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=1008,2048 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=329,668 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=185,375 185w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=304,617 304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=261,531 261w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot of the new Alexa app</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks — for instance, exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, as well as doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More recently, Amazon has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/amazons-ai-assistant-alexa-now-works-with-angi-expedia-square-and-yelp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">integrating more services with Alexa+</a>, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079552\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1200,750 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1280,800 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=430,269 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=720,450 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=900,563 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=800,500 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=668,418 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=600,375 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=987,617 987w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=708,443 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079551\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1200,750 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1280,800 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=430,269 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=720,450 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=900,563 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=800,500 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=668,418 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=600,375 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=987,617 987w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=708,443 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/amazon-unveils-a-new-and-improved-alexa-alexa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its debut of Alexa+ early last year.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rausch tells us that tens of millions of consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy users of smart home devices also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are overrepresented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep-dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Designed for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079567\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079571\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments.

While it has recovered six computers, Luminar is still seeking Russell’s company-issued phone and a digital copy of his personal phone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar’s lawyers also wrote in the filing that Russell and his own personal employees repeatedly misled legal representatives about the founder’s location over the holidays. They’re asking the court for permission to instead serve Russell by mail or email. A lawyer for Luminar declined to comment further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In emails attached to the filing, Russell claimed he was being cooperative and has been trying to get assurances from Luminar that any personal data from his devices will be protected. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The company declined, so we will follow the court-established process for data handling protections instead,” Leonard Shulman, an attorney for Russell, told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The emergency filing is one of the first major twists in a fast-moving bankruptcy case that involves Luminar trying to sell the two main parts of its business. The company is seeking court approval of an already reached agreement to sell its semiconductor subsidiary <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to a company called Quantum Computing, Inc.</a>, and has established a January 9 deadline for bids on its lidar division.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy Luminar before the Chapter 11 filing and has expressed plans to make a bid in the bankruptcy process. “As it relates to Luminar, our focus remains on what matters: Russell AI Labs’ bid to rebuild the company and bring value to its stakeholders,” Shulman said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for Luminar said in the filing that it began hunting for information from Russell in May, just after he abruptly resigned following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” performed by the board’s audit committee. The company was evaluating whether it may have potential legal claims against him “relating to the Audit Committee inquiry and personal loans taken by Mr. Russell,” according to the filing. But Luminar said those efforts were unsuccessful and Russell was not cooperative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On November 12, Luminar’s board of directors established a Special Investigation Committee and hired law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges to further investigate “certain acts, omissions, transactions and potential claims and causes of action involving or related to certain current and former directors and officers of Luminar.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One month later, just before the bankruptcy, lawyers for Weil contacted the law firm of McDermott Will &amp; Schulte, which had previously represented Russell. The Weil lawyers asked about collecting Russell’s Luminar-provided laptop and desktop computers, along with his company-issued phone and a digital copy (or “image”) of his personal phone. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawyers from Weil spent a week trying to confirm whether McDermott would represent Russell in the matter of the Special Investigation Committee, only to find out on December 19 that it would not. The Weil lawyers tried contacting Russell directly instead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell responded for the first time on Christmas Eve, according to the filing. He eventually authorized McDermott to turn over the computers (which the firm had kept in its possession since his resignation), but the founder repeatedly asked for guarantees that Luminar’s lawyers would not search through personal data on his phones, emails attached to the emergency filing show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have offered direct cooperation as well as prompt action, even through the holidays – but if this singular basic protection cannot be confirmed, I am advised further deliberations on this matter will not be productive,” Russell wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Representatives for Luminar arranged to have a forensic examiner appear at Russell’s mansion in Florida on New Year’s Day. But the technician was turned away by Russell’s security team, which a lawyer for Luminar called “unacceptable.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell claimed the technician was sent to his home “unannounced” on the holiday morning “when I was asleep,” and reiterated his desire to protect the privacy of his personal data. A lawyer for Luminar responded that they had “repeatedly confirmed that we have no intention of looking at any documents beyond those that are Luminar-related.” Russell replied on January 2 that “[a]ny characterization that I have been uncooperative is wholly inaccurate” and accused the lawyers of “word gymnastics.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar’s lawyers tried instead to subpoena this information from Russell but claim their process servers were similarly turned away by his security team. They also claim those security team members lied about Russell’s presence at his Florida residence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Can we try to serve Austin again today? We’re going to need someone dogged. He is going to evade service as long as possible,” one of the Weil lawyers wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve. “In fact, he was home when your person tried last time and the guard simply lied for him.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is positioning the sensor, called Summit, as the first long-range, high-resolution sensor of its kind “designed for high performance in any type of weather, filling a critical gap left by legacy radar and lidar sensors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sensor will start shipping in 2028 if Teradar can lock down contracts with automakers. If that happens, the company expects Summit will help enable those companies to add partial, or even full, autonomy features to their vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teradar’s whole approach is about leveraging the relatively unused terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared. And it’s a solid-state sensor, meaning there are no moving parts. All this is meant to give Teradar’s sensor the best qualities of lidar and radar sensors, with few of the drawbacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a potentially attractive proposition for automakers who might wince at the cost of lidars or the limitations of radars. Teradar says it’s already working to prove its tech with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe, and three Tier 1 suppliers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teradar’s impending entry into the market comes at a pivotal moment for automotive sensor suppliers. Leading U.S. lidar company Luminar just filed for bankruptcy protection in December after contracts with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz fell apart, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as the automakers backed away from the tech</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those deals also crumbled partly because of low-cost competition from China, according to Luminar. Lidar adoption has been strong in China’s auto market and shows little sign of slowing up. In October, Chinese lidar company Hesai said it had built more than 1 million lidar sensors in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other U.S. companies in the space, like Ouster (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/14/ouster-velodyne-merger-lidar-smart-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired and merged with rival Velodyne</a> after a wave of consolidation) have diversified into potential markets like robotics and smart infrastructure.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teradar is looking beyond automotive, too, and that vision was reflected in its recent raise. The $150 million Series B included funding from Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, and VXI Capital, a <a href=\"https://www.venturecapitaljournal.com/defense-tech-expert-collects-50m-for-new-venture-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new defense-focused fund</a> led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lidar isn’t completely dead in the auto industry, however. Rivian in December said it would integrate a roof-mounted lidar sensor (from an unnamed supplier) in its upcoming R2 SUV, signaling that there is still an appetite for using advanced sensor technology to bring autonomy to passenger vehicles, especially if it’s affordable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teradar CEO Matt Carey told TechCrunch in November that he believes his terahertz sensor can meet all those marks, and sounded eager to pounce on the opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our main job is to make sure our sensor gets on all automobiles, and whatever the best way to do that is, that’s what we’re going to pursue,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In January 2025, Kodiak’s self-driving trucks began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/kodiak-has-made-its-first-driverless-truck-deliveries-to-customer-atlas-energy/\">making driverless deliveries</a> for Atlas Energy Solutions in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kodiak has since delivered at least eight self-driving trucks to Atlas Energy as part of an initial 100-truck order under an agreement between the two companies. Kodiak has been working with Roush Industries, which was the upfitter for its driverless trucks delivered to Atlas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the company, which went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II in September 2025, wants to scale its tech for the truck masses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bosch and Kodiak will work together on redundant platforms designed to turn semi trucks — regardless of manufacturer — into driverless ones. Bosch will supply Kodiak with a variety of hardware components, including sensors and vehicle actuation components such as steering technologies. Notably, these systems can be added within the vehicle production line or by a third-party upfitter at a later date, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe collaborating with Bosch will allow us to scale autonomous driving hardware with the modularity, serviceability, and system-level integration needed for commercial success for both upfit and factory-line integration,” Burnette said in a statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paul Thomas, who is president of Bosch in North America and the company’s Bosch Mobility Americas division, appears to see this as opportunity for growth in the sector. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By supplying production-grade hardware, we are enabling the next generation of autonomous trucking alongside Kodiak,” said Thomas in a statement. “Kodiak has already deployed trucks with no humans on board in commercial operation and this cooperation gives us a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding of real-world autonomous vehicle requirements and to further enhance our offerings for the broader autonomous mobility ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Kodiak’s plan is to scale and Bosch is keen to increase its market share in the sector, it’s unclear exactly when this will happen. Neither company provided a timeline for when these new systems might go into production or become available.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Flutterwave operates one of the continent’s widest payments networks, while Mono, often described as the “Plaid for Africa,” has built APIs that allow businesses to access bank data, initiate payments, and verify customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mono has <a href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/439400-89/company/profile#investors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised about $17.5 million</a> from investors, including Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and Target Global. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers seeing paper returns of up to 20x based on the implied valuation of the stock they received from Flutterwave. Mono will continue to operate as an independent product, the companies said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2020, Mono, like Plaid, uses APIs that allow users to consent to sharing their bank information, enabling financial institutions to analyze income, spending patterns, and repayment capacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/\">addresses the lack of standardized access to bank data across African markets</a>, where credit bureaus remain limited and fintechs, especially lenders, often rely on customers’ bank transaction histories to assess creditworthiness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ijbkid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Abdulhamid Hassan</a>, nearly all Nigerian digital lenders now rely on Mono’s infrastructure. The company claims to have powered more than 8 million bank account linkages, covering roughly 12% of Nigeria’s banked population. It also claims to have delivered 100 billion financial data points to lending companies and processed millions in direct bank payments. Customers include Visa-backed Moniepoint and GIC-backed PalmPay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Flutterwave, which powers local and cross-border payments across more than 30 African countries, the deal deepens its vertical integration. In addition to payments, the company can now offer onboarding and identity checks, bank account verification, data-driven risk assessment, and one-time or recurring bank payments within a single stack.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flutterwave CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gbagboola\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Olugbenga “GB” Agboola</a> framed the acquisition as a bet on Africa’s next phase of fintech growth. “Payments, data, and trust cannot exist in silos,” he said. “Open banking provides the connective tissue, and Mono has built critical infrastructure in this space.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hassan echoed that view, arguing that Africa is entering a credit-driven phase as governments across the continent push lending-led financial inclusion initiatives. That transition depends on both substantial data infrastructure and regulatory confidence, particularly in markets like Nigeria, where open banking frameworks are still evolving.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the economy is going to be credit-driven, you need deep data intelligence to know how people earn and spend,” Hassan said. “But at the same time, for open banking to really work, regulators need to be confident that customer funds are safe.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Against that backdrop, joining Flutterwave positions Mono to scale quickly once regulatory barriers fall. Flutterwave already operates across dozens of African markets, with local licenses, enterprise customers, and compliance teams in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This allows us to expand what’s possible for businesses operating across African markets while staying grounded in security, compliance, and local relevance,” Agboola said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transaction mirrors earlier consolidation attempts in global fintech infrastructure, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/\">Visa’s failed acquisition of Plaid in 2020</a>, which was blocked by U.S. regulators. Hassan cited that deal as evidence that combining data infrastructure with payment rails can unlock scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both Y Combinator-backed companies count Tiger Global (which was the lead investor in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/16/african-fintech-flutterwave-triples-valuation-to-over-3b-after-250m-series-d/\">Flutterwave’s Series C</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/\">Mono’s Series A</a>) among their backers. Hassan said, however, that the firm did not facilitate the transaction. Instead, the deal grew out of a longstanding working relationship between the two companies, which had partnered on several bank payment products over the years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That collaboration played out against an open banking landscape that has changed significantly over the past five years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Mono launched, it faced competition from companies such as Base10 Partners-backed Okra and Ribbit Capital-backed Stitch. Since then, Mono has emerged as a leading player in the space, following <a href=\"https://techpoint.africa/insight/okra-return-funds-investors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Okra’s shutdown</a> and Stitch’s pivot toward a deeper payments ecosystem play that has allowed it to <a href=\"https://www.stitch.money/blog/stitch-announces-55-million-series-b-funding-round\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raise significantly more capital</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Addressing Mono’s financial position ahead of the acquisition, Hassan said the company, which, according to PitchBook, raised <a href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/439400-89/company/profile#deal-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$15 million in Series A at a $50 million post-money valuation</a> in 2021, was not forced into a sale to Flutterwave and is on track toward profitability this year. With significant cash reserves, he added, raising another round would have introduced new valuation and growth expectations in a tough funding environment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, beyond the two companies involved, the transaction — similar to the <a href=\"https://www.rmb.co.za/news/rmb-supports-lesaka-in-acquisition-of-adumo-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">consolidation between South African fintechs Lesaka and Adumo</a> — signals a broader inflection point for African fintech, where startups that once aspired to become standalone giants may increasingly find better outcomes by integrating into scaled platforms.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
