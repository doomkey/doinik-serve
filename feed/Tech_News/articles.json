The deal, paid entirely in cryptocurrency to an unknown seller, shatters previous records. (Broker Larry Fischer, who facilitated the sale, is presumably celebrating his good fortune.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marszalek plans to debut the site during Sunday’s big game, offering consumers a personal AI agent for messaging, app usage, and stock trading. “If you take a long-term view — 10 to 20 years – [AI] is going to be one of the greatest technological waves of our lifetime,” he told the FT.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The purchase rewrites the domain record books — not that crypto industry itself is known for its restraint when it comes to spending. Previously, CarInsurance.com held the crown at $49.7 million (2010), followed by VacationRentals.com ($35 million in 2007) and Voice.com ($30 million in 2019). Other eye-popping sales include PrivateJet.com ($30 million), 360.com ($17 million), and Sex.com, which has sold twice for over $13 million each time, though its second owner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90332346/how-the-epic-feud-over-the-rights-to-the-sex-com-domain-ended-with-the-ultimate-deception\">went bankrupt </a>trying to monetize it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes,” Fischer told the FT. “When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether these mega-dollar domains actually deliver returns remains an open question. But for Marszalek, who already owns Crypto.com and dropped $700 million on stadium naming rights, owning two category-defining domains is apparently worth the outlay.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When a startup announced plans last fall to recreate lost footage from Orson Welles’ classic film “The Magnificent Ambersons” using generative AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/06/why-is-an-amazon-backed-ai-startup-making-orson-welles-fan-fiction/\">I was skeptical</a>. More than that, I was baffled why anyone would spend time and money on something that seemed guaranteed to outrage cinephiles while offering negligible commercial value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/09/deepfaking-orson-welless-mangled-masterpiece\">an in-depth profile by the New Yorker’s Michael Schulman</a> provides more details about the project. If nothing else, it helps explain why the startup Fable and its founder Edward Saatchi are pursuing it: It seems to come from a genuine love of Welles and his work.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saatchi (whose father was a founder of advertising firm Saatchi &amp; Saatchi) recalled a childhood of watching films in a private screening room with his “movie mad” parents. He said he first saw “Ambersons” when he was twelve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The profile also explains why “Ambersons,” while much less famous than Welles’ first film “Citizen Kane,” remains so tantalizing — Welles himself claimed it was a “much better picture” than “Kane,” but after a disastrous preview screening, the studio cut 43 minutes from the film, added an abrupt and unconvincing happy ending, and eventually destroyed the excised footage to make space in its vaults.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To me, this is the holy grail of lost cinema,” Saatchi said. “It just seemed intuitively that there would be some way to undo what had happened.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saatchi is only the latest Welles devotee to dream of recreating the lost footage. In fact, Fable is working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who already spent years trying to achieve the same thing with animated scenes based on the movie’s script and photographs, and on Welles’ notes. (Rose said that after he screened the results for friends and family, “a lot of them were scratching their heads.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So while Fable is using more advanced technology — filming scenes in live action, then eventually overlaying them with digital recreations of the original actors and their voices — this project is best understood as a slicker, better-funded version of Rose’s work. It’s a fan’s attempt to glimpse Welles’ vision.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, while the New Yorker article includes a few clips of Rose’s animations, as well as images of Fable’s AI actors, there’s no footage showing the results of Fable’s live action-AI hybrid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the company’s own admission, there are significant challenges, whether that’s fixing obvious blunders like a two-headed version of the actor Joseph Cotten, or the more subjective task of recreating the complex beauty of the film’s cinematography. (Saatchi even described a “happiness” problem, with the AI tending to make the film’s women look inappropriately happy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for whether this footage will ever be released to the public, Saatchi admitted it was “a total mistake” not to speak to Welles’ estate before his announcement. Since then, he has reportedly been working to win over both the estate and Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the film. Welles’ daughter Beatrice told Schulman that while she remains “skeptical,” she now believes “they are going into this project with enormous respect toward my father and this beautiful movie.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The actor and biographer Simon Callow — who’s currently writing the fourth book in his multi-volume Welles biography — has also agreed to advise the project, which he described as a “great idea.” (Callow is a family friend of the Saatchis.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But not everyone has been convinced. Melissa Galt said her mother, the actress Anne Baxter, would “not have agreed with that at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not the truth,” Galt said. “It’s a creation of someone else’s truth. But it’s not the original, and she was a purist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while I’ve become more sympathetic to Saatchi’s aims, I still agree with Galt: At its best, this project will only result in a novelty, a dream of what the movie might have been.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, Galt’s description of her mother’s position that “once the movie was done, it was done,” reminded me of a recent essay in which the writer Aaron Bady <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oaklandreviewofbooks.org/sinners-one-battle-after-another-greatness-death/\">compared AI to the vampires in “Sinners.”</a> Bady argued that when it comes to art, both vampires and AI will always come up short, because “what makes art possible” is a knowledge of mortality and limitations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is no work of art without an ending, without the point at which the work ends (even if the world continues),” he wrote, adding, “Without death, without loss, and without the space between my body and yours, separating my memories from yours, we cannot make art or desire or feeling.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that light, Saatchi’s insistence that there <em>must</em> be “some way to undo what had happened” feels, if not outright vampiric, then at least a little childish in its unwillingness to accept that some losses are permanent. It may not, perhaps, be all that different from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/deadbots-ai-grief-obsolete/685811/\">a startup founder claiming they can make grief obsolete</a> — or a studio executive insisting that “The Magnificent Ambersons” needed a happy ending.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Alphabet-owned self-driving company now operates commercial robotaxi services in six markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, and Miami. It has plans to grow its fleet of driverless taxicabs this year to more than a dozen new cities internationally, including London and Tokyo. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And now it has <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-to-scale-robotaxi-fleet-london-tokyo/\">$16 billion</a> to fuel that expansion. Is it enough? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Talking to a few industry watchers, the answer kept landing in the squishy “sort of” and “it depends” territory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First the bull case. Alphabet is clearly committed to ensuring Waymo’s success; the parent company is, and continues to be, the primary investor. Which means Waymo isn’t exposed like other AV startups that suddenly lost funding after their backers (often legacy automakers) got skittish or pivoted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its ridership and autonomous miles driven stats are also exploding and will likely continue in that trajectory unless it is derailed by regulators. (Waymo provides 400,000 rides every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas, and in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This doesn’t guarantee success, though, especially if the gauge is set to profitability. Waymo still must solve several problems, including cost and increasing attention from regulators (the company’s chief safety officer just testified in a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/?modal=short-chief-safety-officer-dr-mauricio-pena-testimony\">Senate Commerce hearing</a>). If Waymo wants to simply be the licensor of its AV tech, it will have to move away from being the operator, which means giving up some control. That’s hard with a nascent technology under scrutiny.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while some of you will fight me on this, it also lacks the in-house manufacturing that <strong>Tesla</strong> has.

Many startup founders are applying the AV systems they’ve developed to other use cases, including off-road defense, trucking, forklifts, mining, and construction. Investors, anxious about missing out on the AV party, are jumping into these sectors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Bedrock Robotics</strong> is the latest example of investor interest. The Silicon Valley autonomous vehicle technology startup, founded by veterans of Waymo and Segment, are developing a self-driving system that can be retrofitted onto construction equipment. And it just raised $270 million in Series B funding co-led by CapitalG and the Valor Atreides AI Fund. Other investors include Xora, 8VC, Eclipse, Emergence Capital, Perry Creek Capital, NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm), Tishman Speyer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Georgian, Incharge Capital, C4 Ventures, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bedrock raised more than $350 million in a short time (the company was formed in 2024). And while that might not seem like a lot compared to the size of some seed rounds in the AI labs sector, it shows money is flowing into physical AI startups. I expect more deal flow; importantly I expect the startups focused on practical applications of automated driving systems to attract talent — if they can afford them. Bedrock, for instance, hired Vincent Gonguet, who previously led AI safety and alignment at Meta for all Llama models, as its head of evaluation. It also hired John Chu away from Waymo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keep an eye out for my interview with Bedrock Robotics co-founder and CEO <strong>Boris Sofman</strong>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">German electric motor maker <strong>Additive Drives</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/additive-drives-25m-nordic-alpha-rare-earth-motors/\">raised €25 million</a> ($29.5 million) from Nordic Alpha Partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autonomous underwater vehicles startup <strong>Apeiron Labs</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/apeiron-labs-gets-95m-to-flood-the-oceans-with-autonomous-underwater-robots/\">closed a $9.5 million</a> Series A round led by Dyne Ventures, RA Capital Management Planetary Health, and S2G Investments.

The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/uber-appoints-new-cfo-as-its-av-plans-accelerate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has promoted</a><strong> Balaji Krishnamurthy</strong>, its VP of strategic finance and investor relations, to be its CFO. This may not seem connected to AVs, but it is. Krishnamurthy actively promotes the company’s autonomous ride-hailing partnerships and has a board seat at AV company Waabi. During the company’s Q4 call, he talked about AVs, saying the company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, a high-profile lawsuit against <strong>Uber</strong> has delivered a mixed verdict for the ride-hailing company, which was sued after a woman alleged she was raped by her Uber driver in November 2023. A jury determined Uber was liable as an apparent agent of the driver and awarded $8.5 million to the plaintiff. The jury rejected claims that Uber was liable for negligence or design defects and declined to award punitive damages. An Uber spokesperson, who emailed TechCrunch a statement, said the “verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety. We will continue to put safety at the heart of everything we do.” Uber plans to appeal the decision. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One more thing …</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week in our newsletter, we did a poll asking what the name or ticker of <strong>Elon Musk</strong>’s combined supercompany should be. Thanks to those who emailed their suggestions, many of which had space themes, like Galactic X (great one). As for the poll, the majority picked plain ol’ X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That makes sense, considering Musk has often talked, and posted, about X, the everything app. About 50% voted for X, while 20.7% picked ELON, 17.2% selected SpaceAI, and 12.1% chose K2, a reference to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">one of the corporate entities</a> created in January. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My pick? I think it will ultimately be X, and the company will include more than just SpaceX and xAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To participate in our polls, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/newsletters/techcrunch-mobility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sign up for our newsletter</a>!</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2026/02/sf-march-for-billionaires-bust/\">according to Mission Local</a>, journalists nearly outnumbered demonstrators at the event itself, where marchers carried signs with messages like “We ❤️ You Jeffrey Bezos” and “It’s very difficult to write a nuanced argument on a sign.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ostensible reason for the demonstration was to protest the Billionaire Tax Act, a proposed state ballot measure that would require Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time, 5% tax on their total wealth.

Because of that India is adjusting its startup rules, and mobilizing public capital, hoping to help more of them make it to commercial products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, the Indian government <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2224069\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">updated</a> its startup framework, doubling the period for which deep tech companies are treated as startups to 20 years and raising the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant, and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.12 million), from ₹1 billion (around $11.04 million) previously. The change aims to align policy timelines with the long development cycles typical of science- and engineering-led businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change also forms part of New Delhi’s effort to build a long-horizon deep tech ecosystem by combining regulatory reform with public capital, including the ₹1 trillion (around $11 billion) Research, Development and Innovation Fund (RDI), announced last year. That fund is intended to expand patient financing for science-led and R&amp;D-driven companies. Against that backdrop, U.S. and Indian venture firms later came together to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/u-s-and-indian-vcs-just-formed-a-1b-alliance-to-fund-indias-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launch the India Deep Tech Alliance</a>, $1 billion-plus private investor coalition that includes Accel, Blume Ventures, Celesta Capital, Premji Invest, Ideaspring Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, and Kalaari Capital, with chipmaker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nvidia acting as an adviser</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For founders, these changes may fix what some see as an artificial pressure point. Under the previous framework,  companies often risked losing startup status while still pre-commercial, creating a “false failure signal” that judged science-led ventures on policy timelines rather than technological progress, said Vishesh Rajaram, founding partner at Speciale Invest, an Indian deep tech venture capital firm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By formally recognizing deep tech as different, the policy reduces friction in fundraising, follow-on capital, and engagement with the state, which absolutely shows up in a founder’s operating reality over time,” Rajaram told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, investors say access to capital remains a more binding constraint, particularly beyond the early stages. “The biggest gap has historically been funding depth at Series A and beyond, especially for capital-intensive deep tech companies,” Rajaram said. That is where the government’s earlier <a href=\"https://rdifund.anrf.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">RDI fund</a> is meant to play a complementary role.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The real benefit of the RDI framework is to increase the funding available to deep tech companies at early and growth stages,” said Arun Kumar, managing partner at Celesta Capital. By routing public capital through venture funds with tenors similar to private capital, he said, the fund is designed to address chronic gaps in follow-on funding without altering the commercial criteria that govern private investment decisions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital and co-chair of regulatory affairs at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association, said India’s deep tech framework avoids a “graduation cliff” that has historically cut companies off from support just as they scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These policy changes come as the RDI fund is beginning to take shape operationally, Pai said, with the first batch of fund managers identified and the process of selecting venture and private equity managers under way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While private capital for deep tech already exists in India — particularly in areas such as biotech — Pai told TechCrunch the RDI Fund is intended to act as a nucleus around which greater capital formation can occur. Unlike a traditional fund-of-funds, he noted, the vehicle is also designed to take direct positions and provide credit and grants to deep tech startups.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-s-deep-tech-funding-grows\">India’s deep tech funding grows</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of scale, India remains an emerging rather than dominant deep tech market. Indian deep tech startups have raised $8.54 billion in total to date, but recent data point to renewed momentum. Indian deep tech startups raised $1.65 billion in 2025, a sharp rebound from $1.1 billion in each of the previous two years after funding peaked at $2 billion in 2022, per Tracxn. The recovery suggests growing investor confidence, particularly in areas aligned with national priorities such as advanced manufacturing, defence, climate technologies, and semiconductors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, the pickup in funding suggests a gradual move toward longer-horizon investing,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, U.S. deep tech startups raised about $147 billion in 2025, more than 80 times the amount deployed in India that year, while China accounted for roughly $81 billion, data from Tracxn shows. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The disparity highlights the challenge India faces in building capital-intensive technologies, even with its wealth of engineering talent. So the hope is that these moves by the Indian government will lead to more investor participation over the medium term.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090651\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=768,540 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1200,843 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1280,899 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=430,302 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=720,506 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=900,632 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=800,562 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1536,1079 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=668,469 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=534,375 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=878,617 878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=708,497 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-longer-term-signal\">A longer-term signal</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For global investors, New Delhi’s framework change is being read as a signal of longer-term policy intent rather than a trigger for immediate shifts in allocation. “Deep tech companies operate on seven- to twelve-year horizons, so regulatory recognition that stretches the lifecycle gives investors greater confidence that the policy environment will not change mid-journey,” said Pratik Agarwal, a partner at Accel. While he said the change would not alter allocation models overnight or eliminate policy risk entirely, it increased investor comfort that India is thinking about deep tech on longer time horizons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The change shows that India is learning from the U.S. and Europe on how to create patient frameworks for frontier building,” Agarwal told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether the move will reduce the tendency of Indian startups to shift their headquarters overseas as they scale remains an open question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The extended runway strengthens the case for building and staying in India, Agarwal said, though access to capital and customers still matters. Over the past five years, he added, India’s public markets have shown a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/india-already-an-ipo-bright-spot-prepares-for-bigger-surge-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">growing appetite for venture-backed tech companies</a>, making domestic listings a more credible option than in the past. That, in turn, could ease some of the pressure on deep tech founders to incorporate overseas, even if access to procurement and late-stage capital will continue to shape where companies ultimately scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For investors backing long-horizon technologies, the ultimate test will be whether India can deliver globally competitive outcomes. The real signal, Kumar of Celesta Capital said, would be the emergence of a critical mass of Indian deep tech companies succeeding on the world stage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It would be great to see ten globally competitive deep tech companies from India achieve sustained success over the next decade,” he said, describing that as the benchmark he would look for in assessing whether India’s deep tech ecosystem is maturing.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan is expected to be there. Apple’s Tim Cook, too. (He has become a Super Bowl fixture since Apple Music began sponsoring the halftime show several years ago.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Longtime VC Venky Ganesan from Menlo Ventures gave the New York Times a quote about the whole thing, saying the Super Bowl in the Bay Area is “tech billionaires who got picked last in gym class paying $50,000 to pretend they’re friends with the guys who got picked first.” Added Ganesan, “And for the record, I, too, was picked last in gym class.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ganesan could likely afford a $50,000 ticket if he needed one. Menlo went all-in on Anthropic, setting up a $100 million fund with the AI company in summer 2024 to invest in other AI startups. The firm has also joined numerous funding rounds for Anthropic itself, both through its flagship fund and various special purpose vehicles. (Anthropic is reportedly expected to close a <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-more-20-billion-funding-010451731.html\">$20 billion round</a> of funding next week at a post-money valuation of $350 billion.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tickets are expensive across the board, averaging almost $7,000 according to the Times (with some last-minute seats still available on StubHub for closer to $3,600, according to a quick glance at the ticket reseller site). Only a quarter go to the general public; the rest are distributed to NFL teams. Of all ticket buyers, the largest group (27%) is coming from Washington State for the Seahawks, who’ve won just one Super Bowl in franchise history compared with the Patriots’ six titles, all with Tom Brady as quarterback.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1yGy9fELtE\">Google</a>, OpenAI, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQRu7DdTTVA\">Anthropic</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCyiXmxHqSg\">Amazon</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NerlyGrv7WM\">Meta</a> are splashing out for competing ads about whose AI is best for customers, so maybe their respective CEOs will show up, too. Other than Amazon’s Andy Jassy, who reportedly splits his time between Seattle and Santa Monica, all of them have homes within an hour or so of Sunday’s game.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is just the third time the Bay Area has hosted the Super Bowl. The first time was in 1985 at Stanford Stadium, the original football stadium at Stanford University, where the 49ers beat the Dolphins. The second took place 10 years ago at Levi’s Stadium, when the Broncos beat the Panthers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras’ latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup’s $27 million Series A in 2016. <span>Since Benchmark delibe</span>rately keeps its funds under $450 million, the firm raised two separate vehicles, both called ‘Benchmark Infrastructure,’ according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benchmark declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company’s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/\">than $10 billion</a> to provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.) </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia’s chips. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42’s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras’ initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras’ investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-ai-chip-firm-cerebras-181107401.html\">according to Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Losing them is expensive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. “this is a joke/satire right??” one social media user <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ArthurCaplan/status/2018066423101161706?s=20\">wrote</a> not long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitely<em>not</em> a joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco Examiner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/technology/sf-billionaires-march-founder-revealed-derik-kauffman/article_1842be47-58a5-430c-b322-dff8910aa98f.html\">first reported</a> that the event’s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kauffman, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Kauffman told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies—just him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a conversation with TechCrunch, Kauffman — who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL — confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California’s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be “quite damaging to the tech economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy in question, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/25-0024A1%20%28Billionaire%20Tax%20%29.pdf\">Billionaire Tax Act</a>, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2026-01-19/explaining-californias-billionaire-tax-proposals-backlash-exodus\">backed by the state’s healthcare union SEIU</a> (Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, according <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abc7news.com/post/here-is-potential-impact-proposed-california-billionaire-tax-could-have-silicon-valley/18405002/\">to some experts</a>. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry’s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California or <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/01/19/california-wealth-tax-exodus/\">have already left</a>. It has also led to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/peter-thiel-california-wealth-tax.html\">monsoon of lobbying</a> in the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why he opposed the legislation, Kauffman expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. “This tax in particular is fatally flawed,” he said. “It hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,” Kauffman continued. “Additionally, there’s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Online conversation about Kauffman’s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. “I can’t imagine billionaires marching in the street,” one <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/DianaVGalbraith/status/2018360039069847836?s=20\">social media user said</a>, of the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That person would probably be right. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kauffman told TC that, so far, he isn’t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kauffman said that the event is likely to include “a few dozen attendees,” although he stressed that he really isn’t clear on how many people would show up.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it’s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That’s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/us/newsom-billionaire-tax-california.html\">veto it</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After a journalist tips her off that something’s wrong with Tender, she sends her associates, Sweetpea and Kwabena, to Ghana to investigate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What they discover is damning. “Fake users drive fake revenue drives fake cash,” Sweetpea tells Harper. The entire company appears to be built on fabricated numbers. “The thing is nothing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s fascinating about this season of “Industry” is how well it speaks to this moment. Tender starts as a payment processing platform for adult content. The show references the very real (and still controversial) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer\">Online Safety Bill </a>that the UK introduced, which has led to age verification and other enhanced rules for consuming adult content online. Because of its affiliation with adult content, Tender finds itself at odds with the new government’s regulation and must pivot or die, as the saying goes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090197\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=1200,799 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=1280,852 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=430,286 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=720,479 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=900,599 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=927,617 927w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=708,471 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/toheeb-jimoh-miriam-petche.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>HBO</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its CFO-turned-leader, Whitney, wants the company to pivot into a bank and has a plan to make that happen, including making Tender’s CEO, Henry, the face of that transformation. Whitney is the embodiment of every tech baron cliche. Move fast, break things. Win at all costs. He’s lobbying politicians for a banking license and hunting for merger opportunities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harper, meanwhile, is leading her newly launched firm after feeling undermined at her previous firm and being called a DEI plant by the man who hired her (a nod to the decline of DEI in the past few years). She has teamed up with new friends and old frenemies and is looking for blood — meaning a company on the precipice of crashing. To her, Tender is that company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This puts her at odds with her friend Yasmin, who is married to Henry and is crafting communication and lobbying strategies for Tender. It’s pride and prejudice — the sugar and spice that help make the world go round. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090188\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>HBO</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The show nails the tech world with such accuracy that reality itself starts to feel like satire. Even TechCrunch gets name-checked as part of Tender’s media playbook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is commentary on fascism via the character Moritz, who lobbies against Western liberalism and is hesitant to sell his family’s bank to Whitney, whose last name is the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/industry-recap-season-4-episode-3-habseligkeiten-hbo.html\">Jewish-sounding Halberstram</a>. The character is perhaps a nod <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jan/29/silicon-valley-rightwing-technofascism\">to the rising “technofacism” criticism</a> of some tech barons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harper, meanwhile, is still a calculating sociopath. “My real passion lies with finding dead men walking,” she says at an investor breakfast. She ends up raising millions for her new firm. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She is the one character whose existence strains credibility. Personality-wise, she has to be shrewdly calculating; unlike Yasmin and Henry, she has nothing to fall back on should she fail. But would the UK establishment, which is notoriously insular, exclusionary, and white, really let a Black American woman rise through their ranks and beat them at their own game?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Who needs realism when she’s such a great character,” one Black British founder told me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said the show aptly captures how detached the UK upper class is from consequence and is actually one of the few shows he’s seen that “accurately portrays the ruthlessness of the British elite, specifically how they maneuver the media and governments to suit their own whims.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nepotism and lack of boundaries at work, people sleeping together for trade secrets, is very realistic and common, unfortunately,” one European investor added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Yasmin is headed down a dark path. Earlier this season, she organized a ménage à trois between her husband, Henry, and Whitney’s assistant, Hayley. As the season continues, her behavior becomes so hedonistic that one reviewer has already likened her to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/industry-recap-season-4-episode-3-habseligkeiten-hbo.html\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> — perhaps a perfect emblem of what lies at the pits of money and power, and the role some women play in digging those holes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090189\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>HBO</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Icarus moment could be on the way, however, at least for Whitney. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By now, the audience is familiar with how founders in the real world sometimes use deception to overinflate success (like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/frank-founder-charlie-javice-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-for-defrauding-jpmorgan-chase/\">Charlie Javice’s Frank</a>) and allegedly steal from investors and the public (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/27/ftx-crypto-exchange-collapse-lookback/\">the FTX crypto crash</a>). There are many such infamous cases, and some are even referenced in the show. But perhaps the most relevant real-world parallel for Tender would be the ultimate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/house-of-wirecard-insolvency/\">implosion</a> of the German fintech Wirecard a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wirecard <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wirecards-missing-2-billion-probably-doesnt-exist-board-says-11592802732?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdFGo0Eu63-uBF0k-Zag3EpnzqH6CUrA4LKVvlq30kE-XjJMJYSZdptk8EhN7c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6984a6fe&amp;gaa_sig=SrQ0eC7J8UdGNNL7DLCf19mXhMLqp8bjFKQ402BEphDywM9sYC8QGa_37ITWv7-Loz6Vxjti7c69jcdjjl4Emg%3D%3D\">admitted that the billions in cash</a> it reported having likely never existed, despite the company’s earlier claims that two banks in the Philippines were holding the funds. It was a tale of complex accounting and legal gray zones — much like the financial fraud depicted in Tender.

Tender’s fate remains unrealized until the last few episodes run. One of the best parts about “Industry” is that it moves fast and breaks things. It is so clearly set in our time and so audacious in its demeanor that the audience is forced to pick their favorite anti-hero and go along for the ride.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a rush, a thrill; the visual embodiment of the absence of ethical capitalists. And yet, just like in real life, we can’t get enough. <br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It had courted Ford as a potential investor, but Jia Yueting, the founder of rival EV startup Faraday Future, had quietly amassed around a 30% stake and was essentially blocking new investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Stern, a mysterious businessman and close advisor to former Prince Andrew, saw an opportunity to break the logjam: bring in Jeffrey Epstein. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ford will likely be lead in $400m Series D in Lucid. Big strategic move,” Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02649486.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> to Epstein in emails released last week as part of the Department of Justice’s latest disclosure of 3 million documents related to Epstein. Jia “has massive cash issues” at Faraday, he wrote, and needs to “sell now to make payroll for his other business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It wasn’t the first EV startup Stern pitched Epstein, and it wouldn’t be the last, according to hundreds of documents reviewed by TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, legacy automakers and newly minted startups, fueled by the breakthrough success of Tesla and progress by Google’s self-driving project, were jumping into electric and autonomous vehicles. And Stern was apparently hungry to take advantage of the resulting deal flow. The documents show he also pitched investments in Faraday Future and in another EV startup, Canoo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unlikely Epstein invested in any of them. Lucid didn’t close its Series D until late 2018, when it raised more than $1 billion from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Faraday ultimately received a major investment from Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande in late 2017. Epstein said in a 2018 message included in the Justice Department’s files that he had no “direct” or “indirect” interest in Canoo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These discussions instead provide greater insight into the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/business/epstein-investments-palantir-coinbase-thiel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many connections</a> Epstein, a convicted sex offender, had to Silicon Valley startups up until his arrest and death in 2019. They also provide a snapshot of a relationship that has not been explored in previous reporting.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the time of the Lucid emails, Epstein and Stern had been working together closely for nearly a decade, the newly released documents show.  To Epstein, Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01885249.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was</a> “my china contact.” To Stern, Epstein <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00754450.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was</a> “my mentor, and I do what he tells me.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-ghost-of-a-businessman\">A ‘ghost’ of a businessman</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090533\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1200,799 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1280,852 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=430,286 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=720,479 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=900,599 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=927,617 927w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=708,471 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Prince Andrew, Duke of York (left) at the opening of Pitch@Palace 6.0. David Stern is sitting next to Queen Elizabeth II.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>John Stillwell – WPA Pool / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern is a mostly digital ghost with little information available about him on the internet prior to the release of the files. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He is perhaps best known as the director of Prince Andrew’s Pitch@Palace startup contest, which ran for a few years until Andrew’s connections to Epstein were exposed. Andrew even referred to Stern as a “ghost” in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02423759.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one 2010 email</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern appears to have first approached Epstein in 2008, according to the emails released by the DOJ — just one month before the financier pled guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida. Stern was creating a fund, called AGC Capital, to take advantage of the economic boom in China, and he wanted Epstein to invest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how Stern was introduced to Epstein. Stern did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this article.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern, who is German, attended the University of London and Shi-Da University in China in the late 1990s, and served as chairman of China Millennium Capital, the Chinese arm of Millennium Capital Partners, according to the bio section of the AGC Capital <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AGC_Capital.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pitch deck</a>, which is in the DOJ’s files.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern also worked for Siemens, negotiating “industrial Joint Ventures with Chinese State Owned enterprises,” before joining the Shanghai office of Deutsche Bank. He started a company called Asia Gateway in 2001 that “advised blue chip companies, Chinese enterprises as well as the Chinese government in growth strategies and investments.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These jobs appear to have helped Stern make connections with powerful and wealthy Chinese businessmen, including Li Botan — the son-in-law of the fourth-most senior leader in China under Xi Jinping’s predecessor Hu Jintao. (Li would eventually go on to become a founding investor in Canoo with Stern.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if Epstein invested in AGC Capital; the financier spent the next year serving his sentence. But Stern and Epstein remained in touch, and in 2009 Stern started pitching other ideas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The documents reveal a relationship that starts off formal and terse, with Epstein at one point <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02436755.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">excoriating</a> Stern for not having properly prepared a potential business deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[I]f you want to do real deals you have to be precise and careful„ every error is a fortune,” Epstein wrote. “[Y]our first grade is an F.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?w=608\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090540\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png 608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=300,269 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=430,386 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=418,375 418w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=591,531 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">David Stern with Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, and former Prince Andrew.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Department of Justice (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the first big projects the two men collaborated on was helping the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/06/david-stern-prince-andrew-aide-epstein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">her miserable finances,</a> according to the emails.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The relationship deepened over the following decade. The two men got close enough that Stern felt comfortable <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02476367.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asking</a> Epstein in 2016 to become the godfather of one of his children. (Epstein wrote that he was “flattered” but declined because he “made a promise to my goddaughter that I would not be godfather to anyone else.”) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to say how fruitful the relationship was on the business side. But between 2009 and 2019, Stern brought Epstein a number of potential deals across various industries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early on, he seemed dead set on starting a “secret” new <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01824161.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fund</a> with Epstein to invest in Chinese businesses together, which he referred to as JEDS — the two men’s initials combined. (It was also referred to in some emails as “Serpentine Group.”) Stern later <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00720322.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pitched</a> buying farmland in Russia, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02644597.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggested</a> purchasing the news organization Al Jazeera and taking it public, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02429755.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discussed</a> buying troubled music publisher EMI, and considered acquiring an apparently distressed (and unnamed) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00956807.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">undersea cable company</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also had their eyes on banks. Stern and Epstein attempted to buy Luxembourg-headquartered private bank Sal. Oppenheim, <a href=\"https://www.luxtimes.lu/businessandfinance/jeffrey-epstein-attempted-to-buy-bank-in-luxembourg-in-2009-files-show/129918820.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the emails show</a>. In 2016, they even discussed a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01062393.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">buyout of Deutsche Bank,</a> which had for years <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/business/jeffrey-epstein-deutsche-bank.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">transacted</a> with Epstein.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern repeatedly flaunted his connections with high-profile businessmen and politicians in his emails to Epstein and his other contacts. In February 2012, Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02018022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggested</a> Epstein introduce Jes Staley — the head of J.P. Morgan’s investment bank at the time — to Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know Anwar well,” Stern wrote. “If he becomes prime minister of malayisa [Staley] will clean up and it could be a gold mine for JPM.” (Ibrahim lost a contested election in 2013 but became prime minister in 2022.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern also claimed to have had <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02510185.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dinner with Jack Ma</a>, had a planned meeting “<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02598153.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">alone</a>” with UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and said he was “<a href=\"https://assets.getkino.com/documents/EFTA02688656.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">friends</a>” with the grandson of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-going-electric\">Going electric</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2017, Stern was apparently eyeing the rush to build new mobility companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He tried to get Epstein to meet Faraday Future founder Jia to discuss an investment. It’s not clear if that ever happened; the company and Jia did not respond to requests for comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But former BMW and Deutsche Bank CFO Stefan Krause, who had been brought in to save Faraday Future, made a direct appeal to Epstein in April 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Faraday Future (FF) is a great story in itself, regretfully surrounded by a lot of noise around Jia Yueting (YT) and his other enterprises (LeEco, LeMall, LeSports, to name a few). These businesses are not working, so he run out of cash. FF is starving,” Krause <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01048952.pdf\">wrote</a> to Epstein. “Great chance to build a better Tesla.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Krause is described as a “friend” and a business partner of Stern’s in the documents. He didn’t respond to a request for comment.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It appears those conversations petered out. Soon after, Stern suggested the Lucid Motors investment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In May 2017, a pitch deck landed in Epstein’s inbox. It was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00696433.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">put together by a fund called Monstera</a> that Stern had <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00696433.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">created</a>. “Monstera can gain a 32% shareholding in Lucid through the acquisition of the stake currently controlled by Yueting Jia,” one slide reads. Other emails show that Stern expected to spend around $300 million to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02650036.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquire the 32% stake</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02649486.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">referred</a> to it as a “fire sale” in emails. Monstera could either hold the position or “[o]ffload” it “when Ford comes in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford ultimately <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pulled out,</a> and Lucid had to wait to close its Series D until August 2018, when Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund invested more than $1 billion. (SEC filings show the Saudi sovereign wealth fund repurchased Jia’s shares over the next few years. Lucid did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Krause left Faraday Future to start a new EV company in late 2017 — first called Evelozcity and later, Canoo — Stern was one of the original backers. He contributed just $1 million alongside larger sums from Li, the CCP-connected Chinese businessman, and Michael Chiang, a billionaire who runs Taiwanese electronics giant TPK. (Li’s involvement later triggered a national security review when Canoo went public in 2020.) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2018, Stern sent Epstein a document about the startup, to which Epstein responded: “fun.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Epstein never invested in Canoo, either. He did, however, pitch powerful people on Stern’s behalf. Epstein <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01040351.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">emailed</a> Deepak Chopra in May 2018 and told the self-help guru that “david has a new electric car co in los angeles.” He told Chopra “they are going to build the next gen health sensors into the car. you guys should talk.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2019, Epstein sent a message to Eduardo Teodorani, an Italian businessman who is a senior vice president of agriculture machinery giant CNH. “My friend David stern… has a electric car co that I think you should explore before he sells it to another co,” Epstein wrote. Epstein also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01617958.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">connected</a> Stern with Sheikh Jabor al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, on June 29 so he could “hear more about your car co.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One week after he sent that message, Epstein was arrested. He died in prison a month later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear when Stern last spoke to Epstein. But in March 2019, he forwarded a story to Epstein titled: “Warren Buffet: Electric Cars Are Very Much in America’s Future.” In the body of the email, Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02632786.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>: “How do we get him ??”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Reddit CFO Andrew Vollero said the online forum site is looking for businesses that can either leverage Reddit’s scale — meaning their products become more impactful when deployed across Reddit’s massive user base — or help grow the company’s user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[We’re] looking to buy capabilities, technologies, and companies,” he said during the introductory remarks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors, obviously, wanted to know more — particularly about what the company had in mind when it came to scaled opportunities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Q&amp;A portion of the call, Vollero clarified, “I probably wouldn’t overthink the scaled opportunities. I would just look at it as sort of a spectrum of opportunities.” He reiterated that the company was looking for capabilities and technologies that could add to its business, noting that it’s been successful doing this in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s really been one of the secrets of our success,” he pointed out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vollero explained that Reddit’s adtech team in particular had been adept at “tucking in” acquired technologies rather than building these things themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Saves us six months to market, saves us twelve months to market, and you have a proven product,” the CFO remarked, crediting these deals with helping Reddit improve its monetization capabilities as an ad-supported business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Vollero cautioned that while adtech acquisitions have been what worked in the past, the company is “not ruling anything off the table.” That’s why he had mentioned that Reddit might buy companies that could deliver when added to a company of its size. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company in the quarter reported strong <a href=\"https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2026/Reddit-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Announces-1-Billion-Share-Repurchase-Program/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings</a>, with $726 million in revenue, $690 million of which came from ads. Its global daily active unique users were up 19% year-over-year to 121.4 million, and its earnings per share of $1.24 beat estimates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit also said it sees a growing opportunity of generating revenue <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from its AI search</a> product in the future, which raises the question as to whether the company is looking to this area for M&amp;A, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit, which has been ramping up its AI investments in recent months, including an AI search engine, has acquired startups before. In recent years, it snapped up adtech players and AI optimization tools, including <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/news/reddit-acquires-creative-intelligence-platform-memorable-ai-to-further-enhance-advertiser-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Memorable AI in August 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Designed to enhance Reddit’s advertising tools, the acquisition joined a handful of others from 2022, including AI platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/16/reddit-spell-machine-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spell</a>, designed to boost Reddit’s machine learning capabilities; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/reddit-acquires-contextualization-company-spiketrap-to-boost-its-ads-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spiketrap</a>, which focused on improved ad targeting; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/04/reddit-acqui-hires-ml-content-moderation-company-oterlu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Oterlu</a>, which developed machine-learning moderation tools; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/01/reddit-acquires-natural-language-processing-company-meaningcloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MeaningCloud</a>, another startup bought to improve Reddit’s machine-learning and text analytics capabilities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The lawsuits were filed <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in response to reports</a> that <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Roblox was exposing young users</a> to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. The verification is processed by a third-party vendor, <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Persona</a>, which deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chats, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with people in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said during its <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Q4 2025 earnings release</a> this week that age-checked data reveals a younger user base than self-reported data. This isn’t surprising, and even Roblox itself said it expected this outcome. Of the 45% of users who have undergone age checks, 35% are under 13, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, and 27% are over 18. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080463\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the company rolled out the new process, some concerns were raised around particular loopholes. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-ai-powered-age-verification-is-a-complete-mess/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wired</a> reported that eBay had listings for age-verified Roblox accounts for minors as young as nine years old. Even though eBay has removed the listings, concerns remain that predators could access accounts posing as minors by tricking the system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox’s senior director of product policy, Eliza Jacobs, told TechCrunch on Friday that the company has continuous age-check systems running in the background to address these concerns and prevent this type of abuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jacobs said the platform looks to see if “there are any signals on your account that indicate that the age that we now have on that account is not consistent with the activity on that account. Whether that’s the kinds of games you’re playing, or who you’re talking to. We also have key stroke analysis. The way adults type is different from the way kids type. So [we have] lots of systems running in the background to ensure that the age is accurate to the person actually using the account. And if we have any reason to believe that it’s not accurate, we will introduce additional checks to make sure that we have it right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She noted that another way Roblox looks for age accuracy is by looking at how a person uses emojis. Older generations tend to use emojis at the end of sentences as punctuation, while younger people often place them in the middle of sentences, Jacobs explained. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to using age checks to make its platform safer, Roblox CEO and co-founder David Baszucki said during the company’s earnings call that the data collected as a result of these checks will be used to grow revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have been able to find a bigger growth opportunity in the 18-plus demographic than previously assumed,” Baszucki said. “We estimate our 18 and over cohort is growing at over 50%, and this cohort monetizes 40% higher than younger cohorts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He went on to say that Roblox is optimizing its platform to facilitate the growth of high-revenue genres popular with older users, such as shooters, RPGs, sports, and racing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox says it will continue to enhance its safety measures to respond to evolving risks and user needs.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
