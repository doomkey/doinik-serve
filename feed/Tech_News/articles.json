Many members of their family have been executed, and they have no history of traveling abroad,” Amir Rashidi, Miaan Group’s director of digital rights and security, told TechCrunch. “I believe there have been three waves of attacks, and we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rashidi said that Iran is likely the government behind the attacks, although there needs to be more investigations into these attacks to reach a more conclusive determination. “I see no reason for members of civil society to be targeted by anyone other than Iran,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kashfi, who founded the security firm DarkCell, said in an email that he helped two victims go through preliminary forensics steps, but he wasn’t able to confirm which spyware maker was behind the attacks. And, he added, some of the victims he worked with preferred not to continue the investigation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tHave you received a threat notification from Apple?

I presume partly because of their place of work and sensitivity of the matters related to that,” said Kashfi, who added that one of the victims received the notification in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear which spyware maker is behind these attacks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last few years, Apple has sent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">several</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/apple-alerts-iphone-users-in-98-countries-to-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">rounds</a> of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/\">notifications</a> to people whom the company believes have been targeted with government spyware, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/\">NSO Group’s Pegasus</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/paragon/\">Paragon’s Graphite</a>. This kind of malware is also known as “mercenary” or “commercial” spyware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The notifications have helped security researchers who focus on spyware to document abuses in several countries such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/apple-alerts-iphone-users-in-98-countries-to-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">India</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/apple-nso-hacking-notify/\">El Salvador, and Thailand</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apple’s support page</a> for what the company calls “threat notifications,” last updated in April, the tech giant said that since 2021 it has notified users in “in over 150 countries,” which shows how widespread the use of government spyware is.

Amazon confirmed the acquisition to TechCrunch but noted that the deal has not yet closed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee, which raised $7 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/29/former-squad-and-twitter-execs-raise-7m-to-build-a-hardware-ai-assistant/\">last year</a>, makes both a stand-alone Fitbit-like bracelet (which retails for $49.99, plus a $19-per-month subscription) and an Apple Watch app. The product records everything it hears — unless the user manually mutes it — with the goal of listening to conversations to create reminders and to-do lists for the user.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zollo <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/29/former-squad-and-twitter-execs-raise-7m-to-build-a-hardware-ai-assistant/\">told TechCrunch</a> last year that the company hopes to create a “cloud phone,” or a mirror of your phone that gives the personal Bee device access to the user’s accounts and notifications, making it possible to get reminders about events or send messages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe everyone should have access to a personal, ambient intelligence that feels less like a tool and more like a trusted companion. One that helps you reflect, remember, and move through the world more freely,” Bee <a href=\"https://www.bee.computer/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims</a> on its website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/05/the-rabbit-r1-shipped-half-baked-but-thats-kind-of-the-point/\">Rabbit</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">Humane AI</a> have tried to make AI-enabled wearables like this but have not found much success thus far. But at a $50 price point, Bee’s devices are more cost-accessible to a curious consumer who doesn’t want to make a big financial commitment. (The ill-fated Humane AI Pin was $499.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that Bee employees received offers to join Amazon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This acquisition signals Amazon’s interest in developing wearable AI devices, a different avenue from its voice-controlled home assistant products like its line of Echo speakers. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working on its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-ios-early-work-on-an-ai-device/\">AI hardware</a>, while Meta is integrating its AI into its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/meta-unveils-its-oakley-smart-glasses/\">smart glasses</a>. Apple is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/apple-could-launch-ai-powered-smart-glasses-in-2026/\">rumored</a> to be working on AI-powered smart glasses as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These products come with a number of security and privacy risks, given that they record everything around them; different companies’ policies will vary in terms of how voice recordings are processed, stored, and used for AI training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its <a href=\"https://bee-computer.notion.site/privacy-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">current privacy policies</a>, Bee says that users can delete their data at any time and that audio recordings are not saved, stored, or used for AI training. The app does store data that the AI learns about the user, however, which is how it can function as an assistant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee previously indicated that it planned to only record the voices of people who have verbally consented. Bee also says it’s working on a feature to allow users to define boundaries — both based on topic and location — that will automatically pause the device’s learning. The company noted that it plans to build on-device AI processing, which generally poses less of a privacy risk than processing data in the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if these policies will change as Bee is integrated into Amazon, however — and Amazon has a mixed record on the handling of user data from its customers’ devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, Amazon <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/ring-reveals-they-give-videos-police-without-user-consent-or-warrant\">shared footage</a> with law enforcement from people’s personal Ring security cameras, with neither the owner’s consent, nor a warrant.

Now, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has confirmed the details of the contract (but not the dollar amount) in <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1947640330318156074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an X post</a> on Tuesday and in <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/stargate-advances-with-partnership-with-oracle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a company blog post.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To recap, on June 30, Oracle disclosed in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001341439/000119312525152035/d136779d8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an SEC filing</a> that it had signed a cloud deal that would generate $30 billion a year in revenue. However, the company didn’t say who it was with or for what services. The news caused Oracle’s stock to hit an all-time high, making its founder and CTO, Larry Ellison, the second richest person in the world, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/who-is-larry-ellison-and-how-did-he-amass-a-251-billion-fortune\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Bloomberg.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speculation <a href=\"https://www.futuriom.com/articles/news/can-this-be-oracles-30-billion-customer/2025/07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on the identity</a> of the customer ensued as people wondered what company could possibly need a fresh $30 billion a year in data center services. For comparison, Oracle collectively sold $24.5 billion worth of cloud services in its fiscal 2025 to all customers combined, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001341439/000095017025087926/orcl-20250531.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it reported</a> in June.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has now explained that this Oracle deal is for 4.5 gigawatts of capacity as part of Stargate, the $500 billion data-center-building project OpenAI, Oracle, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">and SoftBank announced in January.</a> (Apparently, the $30 billion deal does not involve SoftBank.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The WSJ reports 4.5 gigawatts is the equivalent of two Hoover Dams, enough power for about four million homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t a straightforward win for Oracle. OpenAI and Oracle still have to build this monster data center, which will be a costly endeavor, both in cash and in energy. They are doing so at what OpenAI called the Stargate I site in Abilene, Texas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Oracle spent $21.2 billion on capital expenditures in its last fiscal year, CEO Safra Catz <a href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/oracle-corporation-nyseorcl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript-1552014/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=msn-news#q-and-a-session\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported in June</a>, and it expects to spend another $25 billion this year, she said. So, nearly $50 billion, largely spent on data centers (and that doesn’t include land purchases, she said) in two years. Although, to be clear, that money also supports Oracle’s existing customers, in addition to OpenAI’s demands.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One final interesting part to note about all of this: Last month, Altman said that OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/openai-claims-to-have-hit-10b-in-annual-revenue/\">recently hit $10 billion</a> in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year.

The request, which was made in July, is a temporary stopgap while the company awaits federal clearance to dredge a permanent channel to the Wallops Island site.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab plans to launch its Neutron medium-lift rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia, a lower-traffic spaceport that’s surrounded by shallow channels and waterways. The company currently launches its Electron small rocket from this location. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab has a sizable checklist to tick off before Neutron can make its orbital debut, like mating the rocket stages, performing a “wet dress” rehearsal, and getting its launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before any of that can happen, the rocket hardware needs to make it onto the island. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab submitted an application for the dredging project to the Virginia Marine Resources Commission in March. In its application, the company touted the benefits of MARS, noting other launch facilities in Florida and elsewhere are highly congested, which could limit launch cadence. MARS, in contrast, “will allow both frequent launch cadence and the return-to-Earth capability of recovering boosters,” Rocket Lab said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite that upside, MARS is constrained in a crucial way: Existing maritime infrastructure is limited, and access to the channel — called Sloop Gut — depends on favorable tides. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Rocket Lab and its co-applicant, Virginia Port Authority, notes in its request, “there is no permanent existing means of providing safe and reliable access for large infrastructure deliveries to Wallops Island.” (Electron is substantially smaller and delivered via road.)  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab has poured millions into the MARS site to ensure it’s ready to support regular Neutron launches. The company is planning to spend more than $5 million to dredge the roughly mile-long Sloop Gut so barges can perform regular deliveries of large Neutron rocket components. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030163\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png 1668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1200,783 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1280,835 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=430,280 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=720,470 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=900,587 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=800,522 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=1536,1002 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=668,436 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=575,375 575w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=946,617 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=708,462 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rocket-Lab-sloop-gut-project.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Rocket lab’s plans to dredge sloop gut.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Rocket Lab</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dredging project was approved by VMRC in May, but the company has yet to start digging because it’s still awaiting federal sign-off from the Army Corps of Engineers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the company waits for federal approval, Rocket Lab and VPA are seeking permission to use a temporary method called “kedging” to ensure the first five hardware deliveries can arrive on schedule starting in September.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has said it plans to launch Neutron’s maiden test mission in the second half of 2025. But the dredging application and Rocket Lab’s separate kedging request suggest that it’s not hardware delays but maritime access that could be a bottleneck for the first launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kedging, a little-known nautical method, is used to ensure the barges can safely navigate the existing shallow channel. Workers would use a series of anchors and lines to steer the barge through the shallow waters. The company is seeking permission to use this method through the end of June 2026 or until the dredging work is complete, whichever comes first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear how long the dredging project will take. In the case that the kedging request is not approved in a timely manner, Rocket Lab said in its application that it would be able to transport structures over the beach using ramps and cranes. The company received permission for up to three beach barge landing test events — but these cannot take place between March 15 and August 31, so it is far from a long-term solution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the dredging application, the company detailed several other alternative methods to get hardware on the island, like transporting it by road or public boat ramp. However, these methods were ultimately deemed infeasible for reasons such as cost, infrastructure limitations, and the weather. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rocket Lab did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Both filings highlight the importance of maritime access for Rocket Lab’s Virginia ambitions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sooner the company can start dropping kedge anchors in time to receive the hardware shipments, the sooner it can start knocking off the rest of its pre-flight checklist.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Because of consumer demand for early releases, Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/apple-launches-a-public-beta-program-for-ios/\">for years</a> has been offering public betas following its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. This allows iPhone owners to also get their hands on the updated software before its wider, global launch, but with fewer stability issues and bugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest developer beta (iOS 26 beta 4) largely reflects what users can expect in the coming public beta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">iOS 26 beta 4 introduces a new “Welcome” splash screen when you first update the software, plus introductory screens for various features, like Siri and its AI-powered notification summaries and prioritization options, as well as for iOS 26’s <a href=\"https://x.com/entropy7th/status/1947722644305989657\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revamped</a> Camera app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, Apple was forced to put its AI notification summaries on pause after complaints by the BBC, which said the feature <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">had misrepresented one of its headlines.</a> The AI-powered news summary claimed Luigi Mangione, the person charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died by suicide, which wasn’t true. As a result, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/following-complaints-apple-to-further-clarify-when-notification-summaries-use-ai/\">Apple said a software update</a> would be released to clarify when the text shows an AI summarization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The setup screen for this AI summarization feature, still in beta, includes a warning message under the “News &amp; Entertainment” section. Here, Apple notes that “Summarization may change the meaning of the original headlines” and advises users to “Verify information.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other early adopters of the new beta also found that Apple is continuing to refine its user interface redesign known as Liquid Glass. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/ios-26-beta-3-dials-back-liquid-glass/\">beta 3 pulled back</a> on some of the more transparent elements in some apps, beta 4 reverses things again. Testers have pointed to updates in apps like the <a href=\"https://x.com/MehranKhanIX/status/1947725338781618685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">App Store, Photos</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/zollotech/status/1947709872629260331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apple</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1947711322948276240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1m6l8r1/comment/n4kir6k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Weather</a>, and elsewhere, and noted that the Notification Center <a href=\"https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1947713386084483378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also adds a dynamic tint</a> as you scroll.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated software <a href=\"https://x.com/zollotech/status/1947718964273918264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">additionally</a> includes a new dynamic wallpaper, which changes colors, and <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1947729632737833436\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new CarPlay wallpapers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Release notes for beta 4 had not been published on Apple’s Developer website at the time of publication, so there is likely more to be spotted, especially in terms of minor bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside today’s release, Apple also launched new versions of its other betas, including iPadOS 26 beta 4, macOS 26 beta 4, watchOS 26 beta 4, tvOS 26 beta 4, visionOS 26 beta 4, and Xcode 26 beta 4.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A subset of Etsy buyers and sellers began a boycott of the online marketplace this month over its decision to allow “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded merchandise on its site.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, this sort of merchandise — including T-shirts, hats, mugs, stickers, patches, and other items — can be found across e-commerce platforms beyond Etsy, ranging from large retailers like Amazon to online marketplaces like eBay to seller storefront providers like Shopify and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Etsy users have taken particular issue with the company’s decision to allow the merchandise, which celebrates the controversial ICE detention center in Florida, where detainees are held in cages and subjected to reportedly horrible conditions, according to outlets like the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alligator-alcatraz-immigration-detainees-florida-cc2fb9e34e760a50e97f13fe59cbf075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/alligator-alcatraz-immigration-florida-everglades-conditions-2100823\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Newsweek</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/07/16/alligator-alcatraz-conditions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/venezuelan-detainee-inhumane-conditions-alligator-alcatraz-cbs-miami/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CBS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/the-chaotic-early-days-inside-floridas-alligator-alcatraz-detention-center.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The NYT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2025/07/18/alligator-alcatraz-detainees-desantis-florida-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tampa Bay Times</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etsy, its users argue, has a published <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/discrimination-and-hateful-content/123551108902\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Discrimination and Hateful Content Policy</a>, which lists “immigration status” as a protected class — meaning both behavior and merchandise cannot contain or display discriminatory behavior toward the listed protected classes.

Some Etsy sellers worry their online businesses will suffer as a result, even though they are not selling this type of merchandise. Others, including those who disagree with the Trump administration’s policies, believe the merchandise is protected free speech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Reddit’s Etsy Community and elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@alainndesigns/post/DLnBQ1vu9Oi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">boycotting</a> <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@aprilgracebaker/post/DLm8oWtpchr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sellers</a> are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsyCommunity/comments/1lweevw/ive_been_horrified_by_what_etsy_is_allowing_and/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">threatening to close their shops</a>, and buyers say they’re <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/chaoticgood/comments/1lwkkg7/boycott_evil_fucking_etsy_sellers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closing</a> their accounts. There are also references to the boycott across other social media sites like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.walmart.com/search?q=Alligator%20Alcatraz\">X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@yaptrapped/video/7522951152758033677?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-8yF7uTQvoJ5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=boycott%20etsy\">Facebook</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because the effort is so far only loosely organized, it’s difficult to tell how many are participating. According to data from app intelligence provider Appfigures, Etsy’s iOS app in the U.S. hasn’t slipped in the ranks at this time — it’s been in the top 20 apps in the Shopping category throughout the month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etsy is not alone in profiting from this type of merchandise, as some sellers and buyers have also pointed out. Many major selling platforms have not banned “Alligator Alcatraz”-branded products at this time. Among those TechCrunch reached out to, only Amazon was willing to defend its choice to host this merchandise, pointing us to its <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/amazons-approach-to-controversial-products-and-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">policy around controversial products and content</a>.

Among the three key proposals is a reporting requirement, which would aid authorities in identifying and disrupting hacking operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mandatory reporting is also being developed, which would equip law enforcement with essential intelligence to hunt down perpetrators and disrupt their activities, allowing for better support for victims,” read the proposal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ransomware-proposals-to-increase-incident-reporting-and-reduce-payments-to-criminals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its proposal</a>, the U.K. government said the mandatory reporting requirement would allow the government to “engage in targeted disruptions in an evolving threat landscape.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other two key proposals include a ban on paying ransomware for public sector and critical infrastructure organizations, and a mandate to notify the government if other types of victim organizations intend to pay a hacker’s ransom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ransomware investigators applauded the proposals, in particular the efforts focusing on helping law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it is a tacit acknowledgment of what we’ve known for a while: Ransomware operators and their enablers are not confined to Russia and many of those involved are very catchable and, more importantly, prosecutable,” Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst and ransomware expert at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. “I think it’s super important.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arda Büyükkaya, a senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at EclecticIQ, applauded the proposals for making “things official.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While it’s unclear whether everything will unfold exactly as written, we’ll see through future developments,” Büyükkaya told TechCrunch. “Overall, banning ransom payments and actively pursuing perpetrators is a strong deterrent and helps impose real costs on threat actors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tuesday’s announcement is the latest in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uk-plans-to-ban-public-sector-organizations-from-paying-ransomware-hackers/\">a policy consultation process that began in January</a>, in which the Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-proposals-to-protect-businesses-from-cybercrime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">initially introduced</a> the three key policy changes. The U.K. government’s formal response to the consultation is another step toward amending the law, but it remains to be seen if the proposals will end up being enshrined in legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Banning ransomware payments <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/04/should-we-ban-ransom-payments/\">is a controversial idea</a>. For some, banning payments to hackers is an obvious way to stop criminal gangs profiting from cyberattacks and extorting victims. But some argue that, occasionally, paying a ransom may be the only viable option to recover critical systems and get back online, especially for certain critical industries, such as hospitals, which cannot afford the downtime and the very real risks to patients’ health. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://therecord.media/australia-ransomware-victims-must-report-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Australia enacted a law</a> to mandate ransomware victims to disclose if they paid the hackers, stopping short of banning payments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup is taking advantage of that tech, along with call forwarding, to protect users from scams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are trying to understand the intent of the caller using AI rather than just asking the name of the caller and why they are calling. From the data that users have shared with us, a large amount of spam calls and Medicare calls, and then there are political calls. We have also observed that users are now receiving calls from bad AI agents, and we are training our AI agent to tackle that,” <a href=\"https://www.cloaked.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cloaked</a> CEO Arjun Bhatnagar said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bhatnagar acknowledged that Apple and Google’s features are based on a similar premise. He said people sign up to try out these features, but retention numbers are low because of a lack of personalization, and that’s why startups like Cloaked can come in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While handling inbound calls is the first step for Cloaked, the company wants to enable an outbound call facility that deploys AI-bots to hold the line while on a customer support call or booking appointments. Cloaked is also working on an eSIM product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the startup is releasing a dark web monitor for personal data. The company observes different sources such as data brokers, breach sites, compromised websites, dark web forums, Discord, and Telegram for leaked user data. The tool searches for names, addresses, Social Security numbers, emails, family members, passports, and driver licenses.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It shows users an alert when it finds such leaked data.

Cloaked sends programmatic and legal requests to these sites. The startup said it has helped users get rid of more than 170 million records across the web.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloaked said that it has added more than 100,000 paying customers since the beginning of the year and is seeing strong month-over-month growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until 2023, the startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/03/cloaked-manages-your-logins-with-proxy-emails-phone-numbers-and-a-built-in-password-manager/\">had raised $29 million in funding</a>.

Once exploited, an attacker can use the bug to remotely plant malware and gain access to the files and data stored within, as well as gain access to other systems on the same network.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post on Tuesday</a>, Microsoft said it had observed at least two previously identified China-backed hacking groups it calls “Linen Typhoon” and “Violet Typhoon” exploiting the SharePoint zero-day. Microsoft says Linen Typhoon is focused on stealing intellectual property, while Violet Typhoon steals private information to be used for espionage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft also attributed the ongoing hacks to a third China-backed hacking group it named “Storm-2603,” representing a hacking group about which the company has less information. The company noted, however, that the hackers have been linked to ransomware attacks in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Microsoft, the three hacking groups were observed exploiting the zero-day vulnerability to break into vulnerable SharePoint servers as far back as July 7.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Charles Carmakal, the chief technology officer at Google’s incident response unit Mandiant, told TechCrunch in an email that “at least one of the actors responsible” was a China-nexus hacking group, but noted that “multiple actors are now actively exploiting this vulnerability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dozens of organizations have already been hacked, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/hackers-exploiting-sharepoint-zero-day-seen-targeting-government-agencies-say-researchers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">including across the government sector</a>. The bug is regarded as a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">zero-day</a> because the vendor — Microsoft, in this case — had no time to issue a patch before it was actively exploited. Microsoft has <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">since rolled out patches for all affected versions of SharePoint</a>, but security researchers have warned that customers running self-hosted versions of SharePoint should assume they have already been compromised.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Chinese government has long rebuffed allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks, though it has not always explicitly denied its involvement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement that China “firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and cyber crime — a position that is consistent and clear.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest hacking campaign linked to China in recent years. Hackers backed by China were accused of targeting self-hosted Microsoft Exchange email servers in 2021 as part of a mass-hacking campaign. According to a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/us-government-confirms-arrest-of-chinese-national-accused-of-stealing-covid-research-and-mass-hacking-email-servers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent Justice Department indictment</a> accusing two Chinese hackers of masterminding the breaches, the so-called “Hafnium” hacks compromised contact information and private mailboxes from more than 60,000 affected servers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated with comment from the Chinese government.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Their AI compliance startup, <a href=\"https://delve.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Delve</a>, which announced a $3 million seed round in January, was growing fast and signing customers at a steady clip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, inbound interest started rolling in, COO Kocalar told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Delve, which automates regulatory compliance with AI agents, ended up fielding multiple term sheets, eventually closing a $32 million Series A at a $300 million valuation. The round was led by Insight Partners, which took up most of the round, with participation from CISOs at Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insight has been “amazing to work with, and we felt they were the right long-term partner for us,” said the COO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Delve’s new valuation represents a roughly 10x jump from its previous round. Similarly, its customer base has grown from the 100 companies it reported back in January to over 500, many of them fast-growing AI startups like recently minted AI unicorn Lovable, Bland, and Wispr Flow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while the 2-year-old company, made up of AI researchers from MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley, has seemingly struck gold by using AI to eliminate hundreds of hours of manual processes, its story began much differently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kaushik and Kocalar met as classmates during their freshman year at MIT. Both had deep interests in AI and health tech. Kaushik had already scaled a COVID diagnostic system to thousands of users during the pandemic. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, they began working on an AI-powered medical scribe to help doctors handle patient documentation. However, handling sensitive healthcare information meant they quickly encountered the costly and time-consuming world of HIPAA compliance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of continuing with the medical scribe, they started building tools to help other companies get HIPAA-compliant faster and more affordably. That pivot <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/delve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">got the team into Y Combinator last year</a> and helped them raise their seed round from General Catalyst, FundersClub, Soma Capital, and others. The founders dropped out during their sophomore year in 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What started with HIPAA quickly expanded. “As our customer base grew, they started asking for support with other frameworks: SOC 2, PCI, GDPR, ISO, basically the whole alphabet soup of compliance,” Kocalar narrated.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Delve\" class=\"wp-image-3029945\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=430,295 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=720,494 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=800,549 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=668,458 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=546,375 546w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=708,486 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1546.jpeg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">L-R: Selin Kocalar (COO) and Karun Kaushik (CEO) </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Delve</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compliance paperwork can be necessary in everything from launching products to closing enterprise deals. But instead of driving growth, its manual work can become a bottleneck.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Compliance frameworks are standardized. Businesses aren’t,” says CEO Kaushik. “That mismatch is why traditional software breaks down and teams fall back to duct-taped workflows across email, Slack, and shared drives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Delve replaces that busywork with AI agents that run in the background (after integrating with customers’ tools) like internal team members. These agents collect evidence, write reports, update audit logs, and track configuration changes across fragmented systems, automating compliance workflows in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kocalar says compliance is just the wedge into broader back-office operations. Long-term, the AI startup wants to automate a billion hours of other work — eventually expanding into adjacent areas like cybersecurity, risk, and internal governance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insight Partners’ interest reflects this roadmap. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since compliance touches every part of how a business runs, from scaling operations to closing deals to building customer trust, modernizing this function will modernize the entire organization,” said Praveen Akkiraju, managing director at Insight. “That’s what makes Delve’s approach so important.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the startup won’t be without competition. Several AI companies are emerging with agents to automate business workflows. In addition, larger AI labs like OpenAI are releasing general-purpose agents capable of performing complex tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Kocalar says these developments are a validation, not a threat, to Delve’s business. She points to the company’s domain depth in contrast to more general-purpose agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re positioning ourselves to improve as AI advances and labs roll out more sophisticated agentic technologies. But what truly sets us apart is the deep, domain-specific knowledge we’re building into the platform,” she said. “Compliance is always shifting as new regulations emerge and existing ones evolve, with companies interpreting them in different ways. That’s where Delve stands out.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Nevoya made enough progress on its goal to attract investors — and a $9.3 million seed round — to help it move even faster.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The young company, which buys electric trucks and offers them to shippers, is now carrying goods for 10 different Fortune 500 companies. More importantly, it’s offering services as a carrier to those companies in California at cost parity with similar-sized diesel trucks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a noteworthy accomplishment, especially at a time of increasing anti-EV headwinds — fueled by an administration that has publicly criticized green energy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founder Sami Khan is unfazed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea of lowering carbon emissions is still attractive to the Fortune 500s, Khan told TechCrunch. Khan said he also believes Nevoya is just running a much faster, leaner, and better carrier business than legacy operators — in large part by leveraging AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevoya applies AI to optimize trucking routes, and matching and balancing loads with the right trucks to maximize efficiency while minimizing energy consumption. The company also uses AI to help sort out charging schedules and battery management. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started running the trucking business,” Khan said, “we looked at what [everybody was] doing, and we meticulously looked at every minute-by-minute of what was going on. We came to the conclusion that 90% of what was going on could be automated or semi-automated.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khan said Nevoya’s automation has been getting information to drivers faster, with fewer mistakes than humans would make. He also said that leveraging AI is not replacing dispatchers, but rather freeing them up to better communicate with Nevoya’s customers. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-go-big-funding-conundrum\">The “go big” funding conundrum</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khan expects to keep growing this model thanks to Nevoya’s new seed round — a fundraising effort that was initially much more conservative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Late last year, with a pre-seed round in the rear view mirror, and some early traction building Nevoya’s all-electric trucking fleet, Khan found himself weighing options for how to grow his company: Do an inside round with existing investors? Or go bigger?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s when Khan spoke with Shawn Xu from <a href=\"https://lowercarbon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lowercarbon Capital</a>. Xu had introduced Khan and co-founder John Verdon (the former business development head of Waymo) and had followed Nevoya closely, but had not yet invested. Xu’s message was clear: Go for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Xu] basically said, like, no, no, no, do a big round now. We’re going to lead it, and we’re going to run with it,” Khan said. “It was, really validating, frankly, to have an investor that in the first round said ‘we’re going to sit on the sidelines,’ then come in and preempt the next round.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lowercarbon ended up leading Nevoya’s $9.3 million seed round, which just closed, Khan told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. Floating Point and LMNT Ventures also joined, along with existing investors Third Sphere, Stepchange, and Never Lift. Qasar Younis, the founder and CEO of buzzy self-driving AI company Applied Intuition, also invested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That funding will go toward expanding Nevoya beyond California into new states like Texas. The company is already hauling freight in Houston and Dallas. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-texas-expansion\">A Texas expansion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That will help Nevoya generate more revenue, though Khan was quick to point out that there is a lot of work to be done in these new markets before they can also reach cost parity with diesel trucks. He also said Nevoya has to be more creative with how it manages its fleets in places like Texas because there is less charging infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That involves workarounds like charging the trucks overnight at stations typically meant for passenger vehicles, or at school bus depots when the chargers aren’t in use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khan framed this as a win-win. These locations get extra revenue during off-peak hours, and Nevoya gets to expand quickly with lower up-front cost. He said the plan is to ultimately invest in building out more dedicated charging infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To manage this expansion, Khan said Nevoya is leaning on the same model that companies like Uber used as it entered new locations. Nevoya is hiring general managers that will run their own locations like a startup-within-a-startup.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That kind of competitive element of pitting these incredibly smart, talented general managers against each other is really, really effective in driving that next level of performance for the business,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xu said he initially held back from investing in Nevoya because he wanted the company to prove it could hit that cost parity with diesel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to understand the appetite and validation from the market,” he remembered thinking. But, he said, he also felt that “a business like this must exist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Xu saw Nevoya progressing, he remembered saying to Khan: “What would it look like if you actually raised a lot more than you were expecting to raise?” The two spoke about using more artificial intelligence to optimize their fleet management, while also keeping an eye on an autonomous future (hence the inclusion of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/applied-intuition-raises-600-million-as-it-pushes-further-into-defense/\">Applied Intuition’s Younis</a> in the round).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re getting lower cost per mile. They’re getting lower maintenance costs. The AI orchestration for efficiency on the route optimization is starting to bear fruit,” he said. “So yeah, we ended up raising a much larger round that ended up being even more oversubscribed than we had expected. And now we’re off to the races.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owners of the Lucid Air sedan will be able to charge their luxury EVs at thousands of Tesla Supercharger stations in North America starting July 31, nearly two years since the automakers reached an agreement. But there is a notable caveat: Lucid Air vehicles won’t be able to charge as fast as Tesla vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid said on Tuesday that all Lucid Air sedans, regardless of model year, will be able to access Tesla’s network of fast chargers with an approved adapter that costs $220. Tesla V3 (and above) Supercharger stations are compatible with the Lucid Air adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the Air will only be able to charge at 50 kW, a far lower rate than the 250 kW peak rate that these Superchargers provide. The issue stems from a mismatch between Lucid’s 924-volt charging system and the 400V Tesla Superchargers. Lucid, and any other EV with 800-volt charging systems, simply can’t charge as fast as they might with chargers designed for them, as <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/tesla-superchargers-open-to-other-evs-what-to-know-a9262067544/#:~:text=Because%20Tesla%20chargers%20are%20rated,at%20chargers%20designed%20for%20them.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Consumer Reports</a> notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid spokesperson Andrew Hussey explained that engineers repurposed hardware in the Air’s integrated charging system, called Wunderbox, to make the system work and activate 50kW boost charging when using a Supercharger. He added that Lucid views the 50kW charging for Air as another option for owners who are on road trips, or live or work closer to Superchargers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the Lucid Gravity SUV, which launched earlier this year, the Air is still built with the Combined Charging System (CCS). The CCS was considered the go-to EV charging standard in North America and used by all automakers, with one notable exception. Tesla developed its own charging standard, which includes the built-in charging port on the vehicle as well as an EV charging connector. In 2022, Tesla shared its<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/tesla-opens-its-ev-connector-design-to-other-automakers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> EV charging connector design</a> in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology, and help make it the new standard in North America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla calls the standard the North America Charging Standard, or NACS. In May 2023, Ford became the first automaker to reach an agreement with Tesla that would give its EV owners access to the Supercharger network. Existing Ford EV owners would use an adapter to use the Tesla network. But Ford — and soon nearly every other automaker, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/gm-follows-fords-lead-and-adopts-tesla-chargers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GM</a>, Rivian, Honda, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/07/mercedes-benz-adopts-teslas-nacs-charging-standard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mercedes</a>, Hyundai, Kia, and Toyota — also agreed that its future EVs would have the NACS charging port built into its vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid was among the last companies to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/lucid-adopts-teslas-charging-standard/\">strike a deal with Tesla</a>. And like the others, Lucid announced that its next EV, the Gravity SUV, would have a built-in NACS charging port. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup has raised more than $100 million in venture capital to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lumotive CEO Sam Heidari told TechCrunch that the startup saw a lot more demand for participating in the round than he initially predicted. While the company had turned away some investors, he said it made sense to open it back up for ITHCA Group and Amazon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Amazon, it has a lot of strategic value for us,” Heidari said. “We do appreciate the relationship more than the money.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lumotive’s Light Control Metasurface solid-state chips are made up of nano-scale pixels that can be controlled electronically to bend and manipulate light. These chips have a variety of use cases, from autonomous vehicles sensing their surroundings, offering a smaller more cost-effective alternative to mechanical lidar, to optical switching in places like data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is a paradigm shift of being able to manipulate the light electronically,” Heidari said. “Being able to shape the light, to steer the light, to form the beams the way you want it, to focus the light electronically. We are able to, basically, do what mirrors and motors do today, to work around the lights.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2018, the company started selling its chips in 2024, and says it has purposefully kept its list of customers small and focused. Heidari said the fresh cash will help it expand sales and marketing, and put more money towards research and development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is not a science project anymore,” Heidari said about Lumotive’s tech. “It’s a proven technology in the field. We knew that there is a big demand for it. Not only can it work, it can work in a deployable fashion.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

AI agents often struggle to make decisions by themselves, hallucinate frequently, can’t cooperate with other agents, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18878\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fail at confidentiality awareness</a>, and integrate poorly with existing systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Industry pioneers like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-cofounder-andrej-karpathy-keep-ai-on-the-leash-2025-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Andrej Karpathy </a>and Ali Ghodsi have said that, like the deployment of autonomous vehicles, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/when-ai-automation-replacing-humans-databricks-ceo-ali-ghodsi-2025-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">humans need to be in the loop</a> in order for agents to succeed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A startup called <a href=\"https://www.mixus.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mixus</a> wants to address that with its AI agent platform that not only keeps humans in the workflow, it also lets users interact with agents directly from their email or Slack. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re meeting customers where they are today,” Elliot Katz, Mixus’ co-founder, told TechCrunch. “Where is every person in the workforce today? For the most part, they’re on email. And so because we can do this through email, we believe that’s a way we can democratize access [to agents].”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Mixus works reliably, it may solve a big problem in the AI agent space. Most AI companies today either give you a pre-built assistant, à la ChatGPT or Gemini, or developers have to build custom agents using frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or CrewAI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mixus launched in beta out of Stanford only in late 2024, but it has already raised $2.6 million in pre-seed funding and brought on some customers, including clothing store chain Rainbow Shops, as well as others across finance and tech. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says its biggest selling point is ease of use, from how it helps you create agents to how you can interact with them. Users can use text prompts to set up their agents within Mixus’ platform via a chat function, or by simply emailing instructions to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:agent@mixus.com\">agent@mixus.com</a>. Then Mixus will build, run, and manage single- or multi-step agents directly from the inbox. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, a customer support manager may use a prompt that reads so: </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Create an agent that finds all open tasks in Jira in project mixus-dummy, and send me a report with information on all tasks that are overdue.

The agent identified and gathered technology news and trends, analyzed the information to identify potential story angles, and compiled a research report summarizing the findings. At the last stage, the agent was directed to send the information to Katz for verification. Once approved, the agent would send the completed research report to Magzimof. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders noted that humans can be in the loop as much or as little as required — Magzimof said organizations can set up company-wide rules, like ensuring an email gets checked by a human if it’s being sent outside the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bringing other colleagues into the workflow is as easy as tagging them in the chat with an AI agent, or copying them on the email to the agent. That’s another standout compared to agents on the markets today: Most models are single-user, and while Notion AI and Slack allow users to collaborate in shared spaces, they don’t let the AI manage conversations and tasks between teammates in real time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another core feature of Mixus is its ability to remember files, chats, prompts, and agents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We created Spaces so that every team, every person, every group of people can have a shared memory,” Magzimof said. “Then all my agents, all my files, all the people can be in that very specific Space’s memory.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While ChatGPT and Claude both support memory, their enterprise plans don’t yet support shared agent memory across users.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-else-can-mixus-do\"><strong>What else can Mixus do?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In our interview, the founders ran through an hour-long demo showing a range of use cases and abilities. Mixus’ agents do seem capable, reflecting a high degree of autonomy and memory that places the company toward the higher end of the AI agent spectrum. That is, <em>if</em> the product works as reliably as it did in the demo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other agents, Mixus can integrate with other tools, from Gmail to Jira, and users can trigger agents to run immediately or on a schedule. Agents can run and edit documents or spreadsheets inline — similar to ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, but those are often limited to sandboxed environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mixus also lets agents autonomously navigate organizational context — like figuring out who in an organization owns a task by looking through Jira tickets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Built on a combination of Anthropic’s Claude 4 and OpenAI’s o3, Mixus agents also have access to the web, which Magzimof says can be tapped for tasks like live research or monitoring. He described it as “Google Alerts on steroids.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taken together, Mixus appears to be less of a productivity tool and more like a tireless digital colleague — yet another ambitious attempt to reimagine AI as a collaborator. If it works as advertised, your next “coworker” might not be human, but it might get through your inbox faster than you do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: This article was updated to reflect how much Mixus has raised to date. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?
