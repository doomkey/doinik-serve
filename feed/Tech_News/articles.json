But before you jump on the bandwagon, here’s what you need to know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to its tagline, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) is the “AI that actually does things” — whether it’s managing your calendar, sending messages through your favorite apps, or checking you in for flights. This promise has drawn thousands of users willing to tackle the technical setup required, even though it started as a scrappy personal project built by one developer for his own use.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That man is Peter Steinberger, an Austrian <a href=\"https://x.com/TrendingTopicsA/status/2015693268944650570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">developer and founder</a> who is known online as <a href=\"https://steipete.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">@steipete</a> and actively blogs about his work. After stepping away from his previous project, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/pspdfkit-raises-116m-its-first-outside-money-now-nearly-1b-people-use-apps-powered-by-its-collaboration-signing-and-markup-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PSPDFkit</a>, Steinberger felt empty and barely touched his computer for three years, he explained on his blog. But he eventually <a href=\"https://steipete.me/posts/2025/finding-my-spark-again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">found his spark again</a> — which led to Moltbot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Moltbot is now much more than a solo project, the publicly available version still derives from <a href=\"https://www.clawd.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Clawd</a>, “Peter’s crusted assistant,” now called Molty, a tool he built to help him “manage his digital life” and “explore what human-AI collaboration can be.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Steinberger, this meant diving deeper into the momentum around AI that had reignited his builder spark. <a href=\"https://steipete.me/posts/just-one-more-prompt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A self-confessed “Claudoholic”</a>, he initially named his project after Anthropic’s AI flagship product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/25/claude-everything-you-need-to-know-about-anthropics-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Claude</a>. He revealed on X that Anthropic subsequently <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2016079236780449975\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">forced him</a> to change the branding for copyright reasons. TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic for comment. But the project’s “lobster soul” <a href=\"https://x.com/moltbot/status/2016058924403753024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remains unchanged</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To its early adopters, Moltbot represents the vanguard of how helpful AI assistants could be. Those who were already excited at the prospect of using AI to quickly generate websites and apps are even more keen to have their personal AI assistant perform tasks for them. And just like Steinberger, they’re eager to tinker with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This explains how Moltbot amassed more than 44,200 stars <a href=\"https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on GitHub</a> so quickly. So much viral attention has been paid Moltbot that it has even moved markets. Cloudflare’s stock <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/cloudflare-surges-viral-ai-agent-buzz-lifts-expectations-2026-01-27/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">surged 14%</a> in premarket trading on Tuesday as social media buzz around the AI agent resparked investor enthusiasm for Cloudflare’s infrastructure, which developers use to run Moltbot locally on their devices.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, it’s a long way from breaking out of early adopter territory, and maybe that’s for the best. Installing Moltbot requires being tech savvy, and that also includes awareness of the inherent security risks that come with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On one hand, Moltbot is built with safety in mind: It is open source, meaning anyone can inspect its code for vulnerabilities, and it runs on your computer or server, not in the cloud. But on the other hand, its very premise is inherently risky. As entrepreneur and investor Rahul Sood <a href=\"https://x.com/rahulsood/status/2015397582105969106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pointed out on X</a>, “‘actually doing things’ means ‘can execute arbitrary commands on your computer.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What keeps Sood up at night is “prompt injection through content” — where a malicious person could send you a WhatsApp message that could lead Moltbot to take unintended actions on your computer without your intervention or knowledge. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That risk can be mitigated partly by careful setup. Since Moltbot supports various AI models, users may want to make setup choices based on their resistance to these kinds of attacks. But the only way to fully prevent it is to run Moltbot in a silo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This may be obvious to experienced developers tinkering with a weeks-old project, but some of them have become more vocal in warning users attracted by the hype: things could turn ugly fast if they approach it as carelessly as ChatGPT. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger himself was served with a reminder that malicious actors exist when he “messed up” the renaming of his project. He complained on X that “crypto scammers” <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2016073406840476131\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">snatched his GitHub</a> username and created fake cryptocurrency projects in his name, and he warned followers that “any project that lists [him] as coin owner is a SCAM.” He then posted that the GitHub issue <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2016102509324984572\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">had been fixed</a> but cautioned that the legitimate X account is @moltbot, “not any of the 20 scam variations of it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This doesn’t necessarily mean you should stay away from Moltbot at this stage if you are curious to test it. But if you have never heard of a VPS — a virtual private server, which is essentially a remote computer you rent to run software — you may want to wait your turn. (That’s where you may want to run Moltbot for now. “Not the laptop with your SSH keys, API credentials, and password manager,” Sood cautioned.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, running Moltbot safely means running it on a separate computer with throwaway accounts, which defeats the purpose of having a useful AI assistant. And fixing that security-versus-utility trade-off may require solutions that are beyond Steinberger’s control.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, by building a tool to solve his own problem, Steinberger showed the developer community what AI agents could actually accomplish and how autonomous AI might finally become genuinely useful rather than just impressive.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Though the discount applies to all users, the service is geared toward those renting ski gear. By Rotation said that 30% of the ski renters on its platform look for same-day pickup, and this partnership seeks to alleviate the annoyance of renting bulky, expensive ski gear and having to lug it around.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership is fun and timely. Previously, By Rotation teamed up with Airbnb to provide rental wedding outfits for guests attending destination weddings. It was another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/30/airbnb-and-fashion-app-by-rotation-partner-for-free-destination-wedding-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creative collaboration</a> that sought to meet consumers where they are. Right now, ski clothing has become quite the fashion symbol online as the sport <a href=\"https://www.saminfo.com/news/sam-headline-news/4763-116-uk-skier-numbers-up-7-last-season\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remains a popular</a> pastime across Europe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eshita Kabra-Davies, the founder and CEO of By Rotation, told TechCrunch that the partnership came from “listening to our community,” and that the company realized that, though consumers love how sustainable renting clothing can be, they also wanted the “speed and convenience of e-commerce.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With one in four rentals made within 48 hours of an event, logistics was the final friction point,” she said. She called this the “emergency economy,” or the moment of “satorical panic” when someone realized they needed an outfit immediately. Usually, when this moment comes, a person has to run out to make a “panic purchase” for a new outfit. “We have wanted to change this behavior by removing the one thing standing in the way — logistics,” Kabra-Davies said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teaming up with Uber makes consumers move from “fast fashion” to “slow fashion,” she said. Fashion remains one of the <a href=\"https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most polluting industries</a> in the world. As a result, the sharing economy — or the circular economy —<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/style/depop-gen-z.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has become popular among young people</a> looking for more sustainable, and often more affordable, ways to buy clothing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When users renting in their neighborhoods go to the app’s checkout page, they will be prompted via a pop-up banner to use Uber Courier, where the By Rotation discount will automatically be applied. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It gives our community the luxury of choice; they can now secure a high-quality, high-value piece over a disposable garment, simply because it can reach their door just as quickly,” Kabra-Davies continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kabra-Davies launched By Rotation in 2019 and has scaled it into one of the world’s largest peer-to-peer rental platforms. The platform has more than 1 million users (like song writer Ellie Goulding), she said, and it manages luxury inventory worth more than $100 million. With this, the company has expanded beyond being a fashion rental platform, Kabra-Davies said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A powerful example is one of our top lenders who actually used her wardrobe earnings to fund <a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/fashion-rental-paid-for-ivf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">her IVF journey</a>, which has led to successful surrogacy,” she said. Next, the brand hopes to keep building the “world’s largest shared wardrobe.” It’s already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/01/by-rotation-seed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched in New York</a> and has its eyes on the UAE. “Our ambition, like Uber’s, is global,”  Kabra-Davies said. “We want to make the ‘rotating wardrobe’ the default mode of consumption everywhere.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rather than humans operating drones, the drones must operate autonomously. The humans will be tested on their software-writing skills that cause the drones to outfly their competition.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are prizes ranging from a $500,000 pot to be spilt amongst the highest-scoring teams, to jobs at Anduril and a chance to bypass the company’s standard recruiting cycle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was something that I decided we should do,” Luckey said in an interview with TechCrunch. Luckey and the team were meeting to discuss recruitment strategy, he recalled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Someone suggested sponsoring a drone-racing tournament, which was somewhat in line with the company’s previous marketing tactics. For instance, Anduril sponsors the NASCAR Cup Series race known as the <a href=\"https://www.anduril.com/news/anduril-250-race-the-base-nascar-cup-series-street-race-to-headline-nascar-san-diego-weekend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anduril 250</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luckey generally liked the idea but then told the team, “‘Guys, that would be a really dumb thing for Anduril to sponsor. The whole point, our entire impetus and reason for being, is this pitch that autonomy has finally advanced to where you don’t have to have a person micromanaging each drone,’” he recalled, then added, “‘What we should really do is sponsor a race that’s about how well programmers and engineers can make a drone fly itself.’” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After discovering that such an event didn’t exist, the company opted to create it themselves. Interestingly, though, Luckey pointed out that the teams in the AI Grand Prix will not be flying Anduril’s drones, but those built by another defense tech startup: <a href=\"https://www.neros.tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Neros Technologies</a>. According to Luckey, Anduril’s drones are too physically big to run in the contained course in Ohio where the finals will take place.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We talked about having teams use Anduril drones, but Anduril doesn’t make any drones that are of the ultra-high speed, very small nature that you would want for a Drone Racing League. It’s mostly bigger stuff,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anduril is also partnering with one of the established racing leagues, the Drone Champions League, to operate the event, as well as JobsOhio. The final race will take place in Ohio (where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/palmer-luckey-says-the-coolest-thing-about-anduril-expanding-to-long-beach-is-the-fighter-jets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anduril’s key manufacturing facility</a> is located). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Luckey is clearly excited about how fun the event will be, he won’t be a racer himself. “I absolutely will be there,” he says, but “it’s going to be about who can build the best software to pilot these drones.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He smiled and said, “I’m not actually a very good software programmer. I’m more of a hardware guy. I’m an electromechanical and optical guy, and I know just enough about coding to glue stuff together in a way that works for my prototypes.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Luckey calls Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf “our de facto lead software brains” at the company.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founder is hoping for at least 50 teams, and already has interest from multiple universities, he said. Should this competition be a successful event, the plan is to expand it into races with the other types of autonomous vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are starting with these quadcopter racing drones, which is what people expect from drone racing. However, we want to be, in the future, applying AI racing to other platforms as well,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Underwater AI racing, ground AI racing, potentially even AI racing of spacecraft were some of the ideas Luckey shared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The contest is open to all international entrants, excluding teams from Russia.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The difference with Russia is they are actively engaged in the act of invading Europe,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concern is that the people qualified to enter such a race may also be working for their nation’s military. “I would love to have everybody, but we’re not the Olympics,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luckey said the event was following the lead from the World Cup, which has also excluded Russia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, teams from China (home to a lot of autonomous engineering) are welcome, despite it being the country that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/silicon-valley-is-debating-if-ai-weapons-should-be-allowed-to-decide-to-kill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. autonomous weapons hawks</a> often name as their biggest fear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Should a Chinese team win, the prize of a job at Anduril, which makes weapons used by the U.S. military, would not be a given. “If you work for the Chinese military, you’re not going to be allowed to get a job at Anduril,” Luckey said. Certain laws apply, he pointed out. In fact, there will still be some interviews and a qualification process for all the job candidates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The competition will take place across three qualifying rounds beginning in April, with the final Grand Prix race scheduled for November.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Plus, he wants Bluesky to support posting more than four photos at a time, and thinks threads should be easier to create, too.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The need for private accounts wasn’t addressed, but those will take longer to realize, Bluesky has previously explained. The <a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/issues/1155?timeline_page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plan</a> is for the underlying protocol, the AT Protocol (or AT Proto for short), to <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2025-protocol-roadmap-spring\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eventually</a> support private accounts. But that won’t be coming anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benzer also pointed to improvements to the app’s Discover feed, which could add topic tags as a way to guide people to posts related to their interests. “Who to follow” suggestions will also be improved, as finding high-quality connections can improve the overall user experience.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?w=561\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2915723\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg 1202w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=124,150 124w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=248,300 248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=768,930 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=561,680 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=991,1200 991w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=1057,1280 1057w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=355,430 355w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=594,720 594w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=743,900 743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=660,800 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=551,668 551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=310,375 310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=509,617 509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=438,531 438w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bluesky-feeds.jpg?resize=41,50 41w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky/screenshot of feeds</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benzer believes that Bluesky needs to have more of a “real-time” feel, whether that’s around events like sports, or political moments of interest like elections. The company is building curation tools for its team to make high-quality and timely custom feeds available during live events, he said. The team is exploring other new features within feeds that would make these feeds feel “less like just scrolling through posts and more like hanging out,” Benzer said. (What that means, we’re not exactly sure!)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of growing the overall ecosystem, which the community has dubbed the “Atmosphere,” the company will look to improve interoperability with other apps that are also built on the underlying AT Protocol. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you go live on Twitch or <a href=\"https://stream.place/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Streamplace</a>, another app powered by the AT Protocol, you’ll see a LIVE badge appear on your profile photo on Bluesky.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083342\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=720,432 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=900,540 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=800,480 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=668,401 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=625,375 625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=708,425 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/live-now-badge.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benzer said another integration like this is coming “soon.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bluesky has succeeded in adding users, actual usage on Bluesky ebbs and flows, with surges often timed to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/22/bluesky-saw-record-usage-after-elon-musk-announced-plans-to-charge-all-x-users/\">changes at X</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/bluesky-is-seeing-an-exodus-of-unhappy-x-users-following-the-election/\">moments of political tension</a>. Meanwhile, Meta’s Threads has become the next-nearest competitor to X. New third-party data indicates that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/\">Threads is now outpacing X</a> in daily mobile users, though X was still ahead on the desktop web. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Threads’ main advantage is that it’s backed by the resources of a tech giant, allowing for heavy cross-promotion, easier onboarding, and tons of resources. As a result, Threads has been rapidly shipping new features over the past year or so, including things like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/threads-takes-on-x-with-new-communities-feature/\">interest-based communities</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/threads-now-lets-you-approve-and-filter-your-replies/\">better filters</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/threads-gets-its-own-dms-as-app-distances-itself-from-instagram/\">DMs</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/threads-tests-a-way-to-share-long-form-text-on-the-platform/\">long-form text</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/threads-adds-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours-and-responses-go-to-dms/\">disappearing posts</a>. That’s helped to differentiate it from X and gain traction among users, including those who want a network that favors creator content over politics, which Threads had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/instagram-and-threads-will-no-longer-proactively-recommend-political-content/\">deprioritized</a> up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/meta-to-phase-back-in-political-content-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/\">until a year ago.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Employees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re glad to hear the CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic condemning the ICE murders,” the ICEout.tech organizers, whose identities remain unknown, told TechCrunch. “Now we need to hear from CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, all of whom have remained silent despite calls all across the industry.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Amodei and Altman may be taking something of a stand — one in public, the other internally — both CEOs couched their statements with praise for President Trump, as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/walz-trump-phone-call-minneapolis-minnesota-alex-pretti-renee-good/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">independent investigation</a> into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Alex Pretti’s death circulated online. (It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-growing-number-of-republicans-criticize-trump-admin-response/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growing number of Republicans have begun to call for</a> an investigation, as well.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">J.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year; OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\">$100 billion at an $830 billion valuation</a>, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/sequoia-joins-gic-coatue-in-25b-anthropic-funding-at-350b-valuation-ft/ar-AA1UszTG?apiversion=v2&amp;domshim=1&amp;noservercache=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1#:~:text=Venture%20capital%20firm%20Sequoia%20Capital,Cisco%20(CSCO)%20and%20YouTube.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$25 billion at a $350 billion valuation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, such words of praise for Trump is an about-face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">own blog</a>:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/anthropics-ceo-stuns-davos-with-nvidia-criticism/\">calling the decision “crazy”</a> last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and OpenAI for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with comment from J.J.

This includes the U.S, where it will cost $7.99 per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion brings the lower-cost plan to 35 new countries and territories, after earlier launches in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/googles-cheaper-ai-plus-plan-is-now-available-in-over-40-countries/\">dozens of global markets,</a> which began <a href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1965490977000640833\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with Indonesia</a> last September.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan includes access to Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro in the Gemini app, Flow’s AI filmmaking tools, research and writing assistance in NotebookLM, and more. It also offers 200GB of storage and the ability to share your plan benefits with up to five other family members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Existing Google One Premium 2TB subscribers will automatically gain access to all Google AI Plus plan benefits over the next few days, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially focused on emerging markets, the Google AI Plus plan is designed as the first step beyond free access to Gemini and other AI tools for those who either don’t need or can’t afford to subscribe to the more expensive <a href=\"https://one.google.com/intl/en/about/google-ai-plans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google AI Pro plan</a>, which is typically priced at $20 per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Plus plan’s price point varies by region, its $8 per month price point could introduce a new, more casual audience to Google’s AI technology here in the United States. Elsewhere, the plan tends to cost less than $5 per month. For instance, users in India pay ₹399 ($4.44 USD) per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it first debuted, <a href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1965490977000640833\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google explained that the plan</a> was designed to bring access to Gemini, Veo, and other creative AI tools to emerging markets at a more affordable price point. It’s also designed to compete with OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChatGPT Go plan</a>, which is <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$8 per month</a> in the U.S., or less in some emerging markets. These plans are meant to attract the large online population of users who could become regular AI customers over time, giving companies a boost in their AI adoption numbers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the time being, subscribers can take 50% off for the first two months of their subscription in a promotional offering, Google says.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Designed as an AI-enhanced word processor and research tool for scientific papers, Prism is deeply integrated with GPT-5.2, which can be used to assess claims, revise prose, or search for prior research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prism isn’t designed to conduct research on its own and without human guidance. Executives believe it will accelerate the work being done by human scientists, and compared Prism to coding interfaces like Cursor and Windsurf.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI and software engineering,” Kevin Weil, VP of OpenAI for Science, said in a press call announcing the tool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new software, which is accessed via a web app, comes as OpenAI is seeing a flood of scientific queries coming to its consumer products like ChatGPT. The company says that ChatGPT receives an average of 8.4 million messages a week on advanced topics in the hard sciences — although it’s difficult to know how many are from professional researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-assisted research is also becoming more common among academic researchers. In mathematics, AI models have been used to prove <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/ai-models-are-starting-to-crack-high-level-math-problems/\">a number of long-standing Erdos problems</a> through a combination of literature review and new applications of existing techniques. While the significance of the proofs is still hotly debated, the results have been an early victory for proponents of AI models and formal verification systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A statistics paper published in December</a> used GPT 5.2 Pro to establish new proofs for a central axiom of statistical theory, with human researchers only prompting and verifying the model’s work. OpenAI applauded the result <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-2-for-science-and-math/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a blog post</a>, presenting it as a model for human-AI collaboration in research going forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In domains with axiomatic theoretical foundations,” the post reads, “frontier models can help explore proofs, test hypotheses, and identify connections that might otherwise take substantial human effort to uncover.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the value of OpenAI’s new system comes from simple product work on existing standards. Prism integrates with LaTeX, an open source system used to format and typeset scientific papers, but goes significantly beyond most available LaTeX software tools. The program also leverages GPT 5.2’s visual capabilities to allow researchers to assemble diagrams from online whiteboard drawings, which can be a significant pain point with existing tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the most powerful feature comes from combining the usual powers of an AI model with more rigorous context management. When users open up a ChatGPT window through Prism, the model can access the full context of the research project, making responses both more germane and more intelligent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of that would be possible for a savvy user of GPT-5.2, but OpenAI is hoping that a cleaner interface will draw in scientific researchers more quickly. Weil described it as the same combination of factors that made AI tools so powerful in software engineering.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Software engineering accelerated in part because of amazing models,” he told reporters, “and in part because of deep workflow integration.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The United States is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its authority. Several <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-judge-icc-trump-1.7613704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other ICC judges and prosecutors</a> have also been sanctioned by the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prost, whose name now shares the same list as some of the world’s most dangerous people, from terrorists to North Korean hackers and Iranian spies, described the effect of sanctions on her life as “paralyzing” in <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2025/12/12/its-surreal-us-sanctions-lock-international-criminal-court-judge-out-of-daily-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an interview by The Irish Times</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This high-profile case provides a glimpse into the disruption that being cut off from the U.S. can have on a person’s everyday life; lawmakers and government leaders across Europe are growing more aware of the looming threat facing them at home, and their over-reliance on U.S. technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s diplomatic escalations and the upending of international norms, including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/live-updates-u-s-captures-maduro-and-his-wife-after-striking-venezuela\">the capture a foreign leader</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74x4m71pmjo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">threatening to invade a NATO and European ally</a>, have caused some EU countries to consider moving away from U.S. tech and reclaiming their digital sovereignty. This shift in thinking comes as the Trump administration has become increasingly unpredictable and vindictive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Belgium, the country’s cybersecurity chief Miguel De Bruycker conceded in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/854fcad0-0d39-438b-975b-adf9d8b89827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a recent interview</a> that Europe has “lost the internet” to the United States, which has hoarded much of the world’s tech and financial systems. De Bruycker said it is “currently impossible” to store data fully in Europe as a result of U.S. dominating digital infrastructure, and urged the European Union to strengthen its tech across the bloc.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The European Parliament voted January 22 to adopt a report directing the European Commission to identify areas where the EU can reduce its reliance on foreign providers. Parliamentarians said the European Union and its 27 member states rely on non-EU countries for more than 80% of its digital products, services, and infrastructure. The vote was non-binding, but comes at a time when the European Commission is <a href=\"https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/01/25/business/sunday-business-it/eu-pushes-tougher-digital-network-and-ai-rules-amid-sovereignty-debate/2264664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">moving to bring</a> more of its technologies and dependencies onto its own turf.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The French government said Tuesday it would replace Zoom and Microsoft Teams <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2026/01/27/france-to-ditch-us-platforms-microsoft-teams-zoom-for-sovereign-platform-amid-security-con\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with its own domestically made video conferencing software Visio</a>, according to the French minister for civil service and state reform David Amiel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Concerns about digital sovereignty are not new and date back decades to at least 2001 when the U.S. introduced the Patriot Act in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to surveil the world in ways it had never been allowed to before, including spying on the communications of citizens of its closest allies in Europe, despite the bloc’s strict data protection and privacy rules. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">conceded years later in 2011</a> that as an American tech company it could be compelled to hand over Europeans’ data in response to a secret U.S. government order; it wasn’t until 2013 when much of this surveillance was revealed in practice through classified documents leaked by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/03/edward-snowden-nsa-lawsuit-jewel-authentic/\">then-NSA contractor Edward Snowden</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the individual consumer level, there has also been a concerted push to urge users to switch away from U.S. tech providers and technologies, with tech workers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\">calling on their chief executives to speak up</a> against the rising brutality of U.S. federal immigration agents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Independent journalist Paris Marx has a guide for <a href=\"https://disconnect.blog/getting-off-us-tech-a-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">getting off of U.S. tech services</a>, while several other websites, such as <a href=\"https://www.switch-to.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">switch-to.eu</a> and <a href=\"https://european-alternatives.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">European Alternatives</a>, encourage users to use alternatives to Big Tech products and services, such as open source tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But that gap is narrowing, according to <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/obi-releases-data-analysis-of-tesla-and-waymo-rideshare-pricing-wait-times-and-sentiments-302669664.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new data published Tuesday</a> by Obi, a company that aggregates real-time pricing and pickup times across multiple ride-hailing services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two factors, working together, are behind the change. Waymo has lowered its pricing, at least in the San Francisco Bay Area where the data was pulled, while traditional ride-hailing rides on the Uber and Lyft networks have risen, according to Obi. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new data was collected between November 27 and January 1, with Obi simulating more than 94,000 ride requests in the Bay Area. The company found that Waymo rides cost an average of $19.69, while Uber rides were slightly cheaper at $17.47. Lyft rides across the same period averaged $15.47. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June, Obi <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/waymo-rides-cost-more-than-uber-or-lyft-and-people-are-paying-anyway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">released its first report</a> analyzing robotaxi versus ride-hailing data. The data, which was taken from rides in April 2025, showed Waymo rides averaged $20.43, Uber landed at $15.58, and Lyft rides evened out at $14.44. Compared to these figures, Waymo’s average cost has dropped 3.62%, while Uber’s went up 12%, and Lyft’s climbed 7%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obi CEO Ashwini Anburajan told TechCrunch she believes this is a trend to watch because, while last April’s data implied customers were willing to pay a higher price to ride in a Waymo, the “novelty is wearing off for people in the Bay Area.” That means Waymo will likely keep having to price its offering more competitively, she said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-wild-card-tesla\">The wild card: Tesla</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The wild card in Obi’s new report is that it collected data on Tesla’s burgeoning robotaxi service, which appears to be far cheaper than these other three offerings. But there are a number of important caveats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, Tesla isn’t technically operating a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area, where the data was sampled. Tesla doesn’t have the permits required to operate a driverless commercial robotaxi service in the state. Nor does it have a transportation network company permit like Uber or Lyft. Instead, Tesla has a transportation charter permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, which means the company uses employees to drive the company’s vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving software. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s Bay Area fleet is also modest. Crowdsourced data from the website Robotaxi Tracker has helped log <a href=\"https://robotaxitracker.com/vehicles?area=bay_area\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">around 168 vehicles</a> in Tesla’s ride-hail fleet, though not all of those cars are active all the time. (Obi notes in the report that only 156 were spotted by the crowdsourced website at the time the company ran its data sampling.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That smaller fleet has driven by wait times. Of the four services surveyed, Tesla had the longest wait time with an average ETA of 15.32 minutes. Waymo’s average wait time was 5.74 minutes (up from 4.28 minutes last April), while Lyft and Uber came in at 5.14 minutes and 3.15 minutes, respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These inputs — fleet size, human drivers, wait times — could have affected how Tesla prices rides at true scale, and it’s hard to say when and how that might happen. Tesla only just recently pulled safety monitors out of a handful of cars in Austin, Texas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Tesla can scale its robotaxis — which rely on camera inputs alone — the company should theoretically be able to price rides lower than competitors like Waymo, which integrates its self-driving software into modified vehicles equipped with several different kinds of sensors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-popularity-contest\">Popularity contest</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anburajan thinks there’s value in Tesla operating a ride-hailing service, ahead of any attempt at operating true robotaxis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not really an autonomous vehicle at the moment. It has a safety driver in it. They’re building brand familiarity. They’re building brand preference for people that already like Teslas and people who are inclined to like Tesla,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s some evidence of this in the report Obi released Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with the ride requests sampled in the Bay Area, Obi surveyed 2,000 people in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas on a number of issues related to robotaxis and ride-hailing. Over half of those respondents who had taken an autonomous vehicle ride said they’d ridden in a Tesla robotaxi. And when asked which autonomous brand they preferred the most, respondents chose Tesla 31% of the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo was still the most preferred, with 39.8% of respondents choosing the Alphabet-owned brand. But this strong preference for Tesla, despite the company not operating a real robotaxi service at any scale yet, hints at future demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That strong preference for Tesla is also being driven in large part by a particular group: men. Women who were surveyed by Obi were essentially evenly split when it comes to choosing Waymo or Tesla, with Zoox a distant third at 8%. But 56% of men surveyed preferred Tesla to Waymo (25%) or Zoox (7%). </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obi’s report offers a good baseline ahead of a year that’s sure to see many developments in the world of autonomous vehicles. Waymo is rapidly expanding into new cities, even partnering with Uber and Lyft in some of them. Those ride-hail companies are bringing many other autonomous vehicle partners onto their platforms, too. And Tesla will likely look to prove its robotaxi approach works in order to expand its nascent offering.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is also about to start offering rides in a new van-like vehicle that it is building with Chinese company Zeekr. That vehicle, known as Ojai, is expected to have a lower up-front cost for Waymo and could allow the company to get more aggressive on pricing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One thing is clear to Anburajan, though: Real competition is coming. Other companies are preparing to launch their own robotaxi services. Nuro is supplying its self-driving system to modified Lucid Gravity vehicles as part of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/this-is-ubers-new-robotaxi-from-lucid-and-nuro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">premium robotaxi network</a> that will be operated by Uber. Hyundai-backed Motional has rebooted its efforts and plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/motional-puts-ai-at-center-of-robotaxi-reboot-as-it-targets-2026-for-driverless-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launch a commercial robotaxi service</a> in Las Vegas before the end of the year. And other companies like Avride <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/uber-and-avride-launch-robotaxi-service-in-dallas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">have partnered with Uber</a> to bring robotaxis to other U.S. cities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s still very early in the game, so no one’s a late entrant, right?” she said. “We’re in this new era, so who’s gonna capture market share and move fast to win consumers over?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While children’s online safety is a pressing concern, privacy advocates argue that the type of cloud-based age-verification methods mandated by legislation like OSA harms adults by collecting swaths of highly sensitive data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In other jurisdictions, Aylo has often been one of the only major platforms to comply, only to see traffic diverted to even larger, non-compliant sites,” the company said. Sites that do not comply with OSA are supposed to get fined, but Aylo claims that so far, only the forum 4chan has been fined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ofcom also disagrees with Aylo’s claim that it is not punishing porn sites for noncompliance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve taken strong and swift action against non-compliance, launching investigations into more than 80 porn sites and fining a porn provider £1 million, with more to come,” Ofcom said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to block access in the U.K. is consistent with Aylo’s decisions around navigating compliance with age-verification laws in the United States. Aylo’s websites are blocked in a number of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/pornhub-disables-access-in-texas-due-to-age-verification-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. states</a> where age verification is mandated for adult content, since the company believes that age-verification software opens the door to the threat of data breaches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These fears are not unfounded. Pornhub was, in fact, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/hacking-group-says-its-extorting-pornhub-after-stealing-users-viewing-data/\">vulnerable to a data breach</a> at the web and mobile analytics provider Mixpanel, which exposed data about some Pornhub Premium subscribers.

Now users will have access to a dedicated on/off toggle switch in the device’s settings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The devices will also offer stronger protection against a thief trying to guess a device owner’s PIN, pattern, or password by increasing the lockout time after failed attempts. Plus, Identity Check, a feature rolled out for Android 15 and higher last year, now covers all features and apps that use biometrics — like banking apps or the Google Password Manager. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Remote Lock, a tool that lets you lock a lost or stolen device from a web browser, will now include an optional security challenge or question. With this feature, available to Android 10+, only the real device owner can initiate the lock for added security. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Brazil, two theft protection features will now be enabled by default, including the Theft Detection Lock, which uses on-device AI to sense motion that could indicate a “snatch-and-run” theft. The Remote Lock feature will also be automatically turned on and accessible from the website android.com/lock. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We are studying them, if possible, [will] implement a similar ban on children below 16 for usage of social media.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Goa, the southern state of Andhra Pradesh is also considering adopting Australia’s approach. Earlier this month, the state’s IT and education minister, Nara Lokesh, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/andhra-pradesh-mulling-australia-like-under-16-social-media-ban-nara-lokesh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggested the move</a>, saying officials were studying Australia’s law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I believe we need to create a strong legal enactment,” Lokesh said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Andhra Pradesh government has already <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-govt-mulls-australia-style-restrictions-on-social-media-access-for-children-under-16/articleshow/127242574.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">constituted</a> a group of ministers to study whether restrictions or a ban on minors’ access to social media platforms would be legally and practically feasible. The panel is chaired by Lokesh and includes key cabinet ministers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the two Indian states, the issue has also drawn judicial scrutiny, with the Madras High Court <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/consider-law-like-australia-to-ban-under-16s-from-social-media-madras-high-court-9978085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">urging</a> India’s federal government in December to consider Australia-style restrictions, highlighting how concerns about children’s online safety are driving regulatory debates well beyond legislatures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Any move to restrict children’s access to social media in India would carry significant implications for global technology companies, for which the South Asian nation is a critical growth market. Government estimates put India’s internet user base at <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2206477\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 1 billion</a>, with a large share of those users coming online at a young age, making the country central to the user and advertising strategies of platforms such as Meta, Google, and X.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Meta spokesperson said the company shared lawmakers’ goal of creating “safe, positive online experiences for young people,” but argued that parents — rather than governments — should decide which apps their teenagers use. “Governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites, or logged-out experiences that bypass important protections — like the default safeguards we offer in Instagram’s Teen Accounts,” the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/australia-approves-law-banning-social-media-for-users-under-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Passed</a> through the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024 and approved by parliament in November 2024 before taking effect in December 2025, Australia’s under-16 social media ban has already exposed enforcement challenges for platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/with-upcoming-ban-meta-begins-to-notify-australian-teens-that-their-accounts-will-be-shut-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">began notifying</a> Australian teenagers that their accounts would be shut down, signaling the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/07/as-australia-bans-social-media-for-kids-under-16-age-assurance-tech-is-in-the-spotlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">difficulty of accurately determining users’ ages</a>, particularly when people are not always truthful at sign-up.

He added that some states, including Andhra Pradesh, are therefore likely to seek the central government’s support — an outcome that remains uncertain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aprajita Rana, a partner at corporate law firm AZB &amp; Partners, echoed Rizvi’s view on the limits of state-level action, saying that while an Australia-style ban would be unprecedented in a market of India’s size, blanket restrictions risk pushing children away from regulated platforms toward unmonitored online spaces, potentially undermining the very safety goals policymakers are seeking to achieve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/india-digital-personal-data-protection-bill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">passed</a> in August 2023, includes specific protections for children’s data, requiring verifiable parental consent before processing personal data of individuals under 18 and prohibiting tracking, behavioral monitoring, and targeted advertising directed at minors. However, the operational rules for these <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/dpdp-rules-and-the-future-of-child-data-safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">provisions are being phased in through 2027</a>, giving platforms time to implement the required safeguards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, Snap, and X did not respond to requests for comment. India’s IT ministry also did not respond when contacted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is instead focusing on offering that technology to third parties, like concession stands at sports stadiums.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we’ve seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven’t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,” the company wrote in its blog post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These retail closures will not impact customers who use Amazon for grocery delivery. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not surprising that Amazon will divest from its branded retail stores, given that Amazon has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/amazon-closes-more-of-its-cashierless-convenience-stores/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cutting down</a> on its physical retail presence over the last few years. Upon closing down some stores in 2024, an Amazon spokesperson said that the company “couldn’t make the economics work with the lease cost.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon isn’t giving up on the brick-and-mortar side of its business, though. Instead, it will embrace the fact that people have a stronger brand affinity with Whole Foods Market than the Amazon Go convenience store. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon will open more than 100 new Whole Foods stores over the next few years. The company says Whole Foods has seen over 40% sales growth and expansion to 550 stores since it was acquired by Amazon in 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also plans to open more Whole Foods Market Daily Shop locations — a smaller version of the grocery store with an emphasis on convenience and grab-and-go meals. These seem similar to the idea behind Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores, but people probably feel better about grabbing a salad from Whole Foods than the Amazon Fresh store … even though they’re the same company.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Major players like Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Freshworks currently dominate the space, but lots of smaller startups are betting that reshuffling workflows will give them a chance to cut in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.tryrisotto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Risotto</a> is one of those startups, and after today, it will have plenty of runway to test its theory. The company on Tuesday said it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bonfire Ventures, with participation from 645 Ventures, Y Combinator, Ritual Capital, and SurgePoint Capital.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Designed to autonomously resolve help desk tickets, Risotto sits between ticket management systems like Jira and the complex internal tooling needed to resolve them. The product is built on a third-party foundation model, but CEO Aron Solberg says the core of the business is the infrastructure that sits between the model and the customer, keeping the non-deterministic nature of the model in check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our special sauce is the prompt libraries, the eval suites, and the thousands and thousands of real-world examples that the AI gets trained on to ensure it actually does what it’s expected to do,” Solberg told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Working with the payroll company <a href=\"https://gusto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gusto</a>, Risotto was able to automate away 60% of the company’s support tickets. Its current work is focused on conventional ticketing systems, but Risotto is also positioning itself for a more radical shift in the industry, as AI triggers more fundamental changes in the way help desks function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With 95% of our customers, humans still solve tickets the traditional way,” Solberg said. “But we see the newer companies shifting to have the primary interface between humans and the technology be an LLM.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practical terms, this would mean tasks are managed through tools like ChatGPT for Enterprise, which coordinate help-desk tickets alongside a range of other professional tasks. Solberg says his team has already worked on integrations with ChatGPT for Enterprise and Gemini, connecting Risotto over MCP.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that approach becomes more common, it would mean significant changes for the industry at large. Risotto and similar products would function as tools that would be called by a central AI, offering more focused and reliable service than a general-purpose system could perform on its own. It’s a new paradigm for thinking about SaaS products — one where reliability and context-management are more important than human-friendly interfaces.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Risotto’s most immediate value proposition comes from taming the mess of different IT systems. As Solberg sees it, there is still plenty of value in making it easier to use existing ticketing systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of our customers has four full-time employees just to manage Jira,” Solberg says. “And that’s to say nothing about implementing AI. That’s just to wrangle the platform itself.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
