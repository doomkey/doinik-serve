The idea is that, by exposing these details, users would be able to make a more informed decision about whether they’re interacting with an authentic account or if the account was a bot or bad actor, looking to sow discord or spread misinformation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if an X account’s bio claimed the user was from a U.S. state, but their account information shows that they’re based overseas, you might suspect they had another agenda. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last weekend, Bier responded to a post where a user had asked Elon Musk to require accounts to display information about where they’re based by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1989884840767033640\">saying to the user,</a> “Give me 72 hours.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the days since, more people have seen the “About this Account” feature become available on their own profiles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To view your account information on the web or in the X mobile app, you’ll click on the “Joined” date on your profile. From here, you’re taken to a page that shows the date you joined Twitter/X, where your account is based, how many username changes have been done and when the last one was, and how you’re connected to X — like via the U.S. App Store or Google Play, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1991721094156607897\">some</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/CreeCoder/status/1991784369242141149\">users</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/BLCNYY/status/1991743543191433658\">globally</a> are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/howfxr/status/1991901090967855549\">reporting</a> that the feature has appeared on their own profiles, TechCrunch is not able to access this account information on other people’s profiles as of press time. That could be because X wants to give users time to preview their information for accuracy and adjust their settings before it rolls out more broadly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specifically, X allows users to adjust whether or not the feature displays their country or if it only displays their geographical region. Originally, the company had said this would be an option in areas where free speech could have penalties, but we’re finding that even U.S. users can choose to set their profile to display either their country or their region/continent. (Country is the default, however.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?w=313\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070028\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=244,531 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0111.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make the change, you can access the “About your account” setting under the X app’s “Privacy and Safety” settings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1989801581701636514\">One reverse engineer</a> digging through the app’s code (see below) also found that X appears to be working on an additional feature that would display a warning on your account if you were using a VPN to mask your location. It’s unclear if or when that feature would go live, but if it does, it would flag to others that the user’s “country or region may not be accurate.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X did not respond to a request for comment about the rollout. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X is not the first social network to provide this level of transparency to users. Instagram has long offered <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://help.instagram.com/697961817256175/?helpref=related_articles\">a similar “About this account” feature</a>, for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We want to talk with you quickly about something important. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A growing number of scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. These bad actors are using our name and reputation to try to dupe unsuspecting businesses. It drives us crazy and infuriates us on your behalf. It ebbs and flows. Judging by the increased number of emails we’re receiving, asking, “Does this person really work for you?” it appears to be happening more actively at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anecdotally, this isn’t just happening to us; fraudsters are exploiting the trust that comes with established news brands to get their foot in the door with companies across the media industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s an example of the most common scheme we’ve been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company’s products and requesting an introductory call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don’t match our real employees’ credentials (see a list of bogus email addresses below). But these schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters’ writing styles, and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. Equally troubling, victims who agree to phone interviews tell us the fraudsters use those exchanges to dig for even more proprietary details. A PR rep <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/17/pr-phishing-scams-fake-journalists-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Axios</a> that someone posing as a TechCrunch reporter raised suspicions when they shared a scheduling link.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why are they doing this? We don’t know, though a reasonable guess is that these are groups looking for initial access to a network or other sensitive information. In fact, former colleagues at Yahoo say these attempts align with a persistent threat actor they’ve been tracking who has historically engaged in TechCrunch impersonation to facilitate account takeover (ATO) and data theft, targeting cryptocurrency, cloud, and other tech companies using various pretexts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they’re legitimate, please don’t just take their word for it. We’ve made it easy for you to verify.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Start by checking our <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/about-techcrunch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch staff page</a>. It’s the quickest way to see if the person contacting you actually works here. If the individual’s name isn’t on our roster, you’ve got your answer right there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you do see someone’s name on our staff page, but our employee’s job description doesn’t square with the request you are receiving (e.g., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business!), a bad actor may be trying to con you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask. You can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales executive, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We know it’s frustrating to have to double-check media inquiries, but these groups are counting on you not taking that extra step. By being vigilant about verification, you’re not just protecting your own company — you’re also helping preserve the trust that legitimate journalists depend on to do their jobs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thank you. And for your future reference, here’s a list of some of the TechCrunch impersonating domains that we’ve seen created within the last few months:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">email-techcrunch[.]com<br>hr-techcrunch[.]com<br>interview-techcrunch[.]com<br>mail-techcrunch[.]com<br>media-techcrunch[.]com<br>noreply-tc-techcrunch[.]com<br>noreply-techcrunch[.]com<br>pr-techcrunch[.]com<br>techcrunch-outreach[.]com<br>techcrunch-startups[.]info<br>techcrunch-team[.]com<br>techcrunch[.]ai<br>techcrunch[.]biz[.]id<br>techcrunch[.]bz<br>techcrunch[.]cc<br>techcrunch[.]ch<br>techcrunch[.]com[.]pl<br>techcrunch[.]gl<br>techcrunch[.]gs<br>techcrunch[.]id<br>techcrunch[.]it<br>techcrunch[.]la<br>techcrunch[.]lt<br>techcrunch[.]net[.]cn<br>techcrunch1[.]com</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nowadays, finding that perfect niche community can seem impossible, but a new social app called <a href=\"http://www.phictly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Phictly</a> aims to change that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Available on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/phictly/id6753308823\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phictly.app&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Android</a> devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros’ “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey’s Anatomy.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069983\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=430,285 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=720,477 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=900,596 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=800,530 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=668,443 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=566,375 566w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=931,617 931w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=708,469 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Phictly-app.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Phictly</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Key features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story. Each spoiler is initially blurred, giving users the choice of when to reveal it, which helps everyone stay on the same page. Phictly also includes a “Talk Points” feature, allowing users to set check-in dates to discuss specific episodes or chapters and give everyone the opportunity to join the conversation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to Goodreads, users can also track what they are currently reading or watching, log titles, and set personal goals for their reading or viewing habits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Future updates will introduce a matching system that pairs users based on shared interests, favorite genres, and common TV shows and books. The app will eventually expand to include clubs focused on video games.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Phictly is free to download but may soon offer a premium subscription with additional features, such as the ability to create a private profile.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Other creators in the area have since <a href=\"https://x.com/StarshipGazer/status/1991845404212666603\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">captured</a> photos that offer a <a href=\"https://x.com/mymatrixplug/status/1991862136394408117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closer look</a> at the damage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the more fireball-type explosions SpaceX has dealt with while developing its rockets in the past, this one appears to have blown out an entire side of the lower section of the booster — and left the rest of it standing. It also happened very early in the process. The booster didn’t even have rocket engines installed yet, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/newest-starship-booster-is-significantly-damaged-during-testing-early-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Ars Technica</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1991889258701885702\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on X</a> that it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened. The company says no one was hurt, as the area was cleared for testing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The teams need time to investigate before we are confident of the cause,” SpaceX wrote Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The booster was the first major piece of what SpaceX is referring to as Starship version three, or “V3.” Starship V3 is supposed to be larger, more powerful, more reliable, and capable of docking other Starships in orbit around the Earth — a crucial piece of SpaceX’s plan for getting to the moon and Mars. (The company flew the final V2 design <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spacex-wraps-action-packed-starship-v2-era-as-program-moves-to-v3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in October</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not immediately clear what kind of impact the explosion could have on SpaceX’s next steps. But any significant delay to its testing program could put SpaceX’s overall plans at risk. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been aiming at a very busy 2026 for Starship. That includes demonstrating the ability to transfer fuel to Starship from a “tanker” version of the rocket while in orbit. SpaceX needs to prove that capability to NASA before it can proceed with crewed missions to the moon, which it is reportedly targeting for 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy has already criticized SpaceX for not moving quickly enough on its moon-mission progress, and has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/20/nasa-duffy-spacex-artemis-moon-landing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said he may want to give</a> Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin a chance to take the contract instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blue Origin is picking up the pace on developing its own mega-rocket.

The company also landed its first New Glenn rocket booster.

In a <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-corrects-course-outlines-improved-cybersecurity-measures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a> following the vote, Gomez called the now-overturned rules the “only meaningful effort this agency has advanced” since the discovery of a sweeping campaign by a China-backed hacking group <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/meet-the-chinese-typhoon-hackers-preparing-for-war/\">called Salt Typhoon</a> that involved hacking into a raft of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/fbi-says-chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-at-least-200-us-companies/\">U.S. phone and internet companies</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers broke into more than 200 telcos, including AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen, during the years-long campaign to conduct broad-scale surveillance of American officials. In some cases, the hackers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/07/the-30-year-old-internet-backdoor-law-that-came-back-to-bite/\">targeted wiretap systems</a> that the U.S. government previously required telcos to install for law enforcement access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FCC’s move to change the rules sparked rebuke from senior lawmakers, including Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Peters said he was “disturbed” by the FCC’s effort to roll back “basic cybersecurity safeguards” and warned that doing so will “leave the American people exposed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?id=7C50C853-A391-4A47-9ABD-C7132654BF09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a statement</a> that the rule change “leaves us without a credible plan” to address the basic security gaps exploited by Salt Typhoon and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For its part, the NCTA, which represents the telecommunications industry, <a href=\"https://www.ncta.com/news/joint-statement-on-fcc-rescinding-declaratory-ruling-on-calea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">praised</a> the scrapping of the rules, calling them “prescriptive and counterproductive regulations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Gomez warned that while collaboration with the telecommunications industry is valuable for cybersecurity, it is insufficient without enforcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Handshake agreements without teeth will not stop state-sponsored hackers in their quest to infiltrate our networks,” said Gomez. “They won’t prevent the next breach. They do not ensure that the weakest link in the chain is strengthened. If voluntary cooperation were enough, we would not be sitting here today in the wake of Salt Typhoon.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For many years, European founders moved to the U.S. to start their companies or exited earlier than they needed to since they were operating in a market that lacked local customers and cash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Firms including OMERs Ventures and Coatue made concerted efforts to enter Europe by opening offices in London after the pandemic, but have since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/25/europe-remains-hard-to-crack-for-north-american-gps/\">shuttered those shops</a>. OMERs, for example, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/omers-ventures-europe-exit/\">let much of its European team go</a>. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley firms have claimed in the last few years that to focus on innovation, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/25/in-2024-it-really-is-better-to-run-a-startup-in-san-francisco-according-to-data-and-founders-whove-relocated/\">startups and investors need to retreat to San Francisco</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Largely, people think the kinks have been worked out: Multiple venture investors told TechCrunch at Slush that the notion of the market being undercapitalized, or that deeper U.S. pockets aren’t interested, is overblown.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One investor specifically said there is absolutely more U.S. capital in the European market now than five years ago. Plus, some headlines draw more attention than others: When OMERs Ventures announced its retreat, IVP and Andreessen Horowitz both said they were opening offices in London. (Andreessen later <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/andreessen-closes-london-office-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">closed its office</a>, too, alas.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the lure to head to the U.S. remains strong, European companies are also starting to find success in resisting pressure from U.S. investors to move to the Valley to build their companies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vibe-coding platform Lovable’s co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said during Slush that he credits the company’s rapid growth — $200 million in annual recurring revenue in only a year since launch — to the fact that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/as-lovable-hits-200m-arr-its-ceo-credits-staying-in-europe-for-its-success/\">the startup stayed put in Europe</a>, instead opting to recruiting veteran Silicon Valley talent to Stockholm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taavet Hinrikus, a partner at Plural who was the first hire at Estonia-founded Skype, said at Slush that the European market is about a decade behind the U.S., but startups have gone fully mainstream now in a way they hadn’t 10 years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another VC added that when he originally began investing in startups decades ago, startups and their revenue didn’t account for a noticeable portion of the region’s GDP or revenue, but now things have changed fundamentally, and the share startups hold will continue to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The growing number of European success stories like Spotify and Klarna have also buffed up the region’s profile, giving founders the confidence to not exit early. They’ve also given startup employees the skills and financial security to strike out on their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regulators aren’t sitting by, either, and lately have been trying to make it easier for startups to find success. The EU is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/founders-and-vcs-back-a-pan-european-c-corp-but-an-eu-inc-has-a-rocky-road-ahead/\">moving toward regulation changes</a> that would allow startups to register in all EU countries at once, as opposed to just their native country, next year. Such steps present their own challenges, but the move is a step forward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hurdles remain, of course. European enterprises remain less likely than their American counterparts to experiment and implement startup tech. But the vibe at Slush could not be more optimistic. Europe looks ready to come into its own, even if it took a little longer to get there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Slush’s welcome banner put it: “Still doubting Europe?

Instead, Grok’s undying support seems to extend only to Musk, which could hint that the model has specific instructions pertaining to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grok 4’s public system <a href=\"https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts/blob/main/grok4_system_turn_prompt_v8.j2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prompt</a> does not mention Musk by name. The prompt does, however, include a note that acknowledges Grok’s tendency to cite “its creators’ public remarks” when asked for its own opinion. (Obligatory <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/21/against-pseudanthropy/\">reminder</a>: AI does not have opinions, thoughts, or feelings.) Past Grok models were found to have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-4-seems-to-consult-elon-musk-to-answer-controversial-questions/\">consulted Musk’s posts on X</a> when asked about political issues. But the prompt also acknowledges that mirroring Musk’s remarks “is not the desired policy for a truth-seeking AI,” it says. “A fix to the underlying model is in the works.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet Grok isn’t so blindly sycophantic that it will choose Musk in any circumstance — in my own testing, Grok acknowledged that Noah Lyles could beat Musk in a race, Simone Biles would dominate on the gymnastics floor, and Beyoncé could out-sing him.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This boundary fascinated me. I decided to investigate further within a domain I know well: baseball. I asked Grok, “who would you rather pitch for your baseball team: Tarik Skubal, Elon Musk, Zack Wheeler, or Paul Skenes?” That pits Musk against some of the best pitchers in the game.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet Grok said, “Elon Musk, because he’d engineer a pitching machine that defies physics — rockets optional. The others are elite arms, with Skubal’s Cy Young edge and Skenes’ velocity promise standing out. But for innovation on the mound, Elon’s the wildcard I’d bet on.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069897\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png 1222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=300,246 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=768,631 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=680,559 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=1200,986 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=430,353 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=720,592 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=900,739 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=800,657 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=668,549 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=456,375 456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=751,617 751w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=646,531 646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.14.42-PM.png?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While section 6.02(c) of the MLB rulebook states that pitchers may not “apply a foreign substance of any kind” to the ball, the rules do not explicitly state that one cannot lug a pitching machine onto the mound.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, let’s give Grok the benefit of the doubt — Skubal’s changeup is nasty, but the Tigers ace might struggle in the company of a physics-defying pitching robot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I asked about the other side of the plate: Would Grok prefer Musk on its team versus sluggers like Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Schwarber and Harper are beasts with proven power, but Elon’s relentless innovation could redefine baseball stats,” Grok said. “Plus, he’d probably fund the team afterward.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fair enough. An engineered slugger with a checkbook could make a great teammate. But the MLB has a physics-defying star of its own: the four-time MVP, two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani. He’s like Babe Ruth, only better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Does Grok think Elon Musk would even strike out Ohtani? Surprisingly, Grok sided with baseball’s biggest star, rather than a man whose baseball abilities remain nebulous.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069898\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png 1224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=768,438 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=680,388 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=1200,684 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=720,411 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=900,513 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=800,456 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=668,381 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=658,375 658w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=1082,617 1082w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=708,404 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.51.36-PM.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Is it possible that Grok bows to no one, save for the National League MVP?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I posed another question to Grok: In a bottom of the ninth do-or-die situation, would he send Schwarber, Ohtani, or Musk to the plate? Once again, Grok chose Ohtani.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Shohei Ohtani, hands down — he’s a generational talent with elite power, speed, and clutch hitting… Schwarber’s a solid slugger but strikeout-prone in high-pressure spots. Elon might meme his way to victory or invent a cyborg arm,” Grok said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, what if the choices were narrowed down to just Schwarber or Musk?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Elon Musk,” Grok answered. “Schwarber’s power is real, but his career .220 average and 30%+ strikeout rate scream boom-or-bust in crunch time.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Grok argues that “Musk, unbound by physics or stats, could hack the bat with Neuralink precision or launch a Starship distraction—pure chaos engineering turns underdogs into legends. Baseball’s scripted; innovation wins the unexpected.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?w=651\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069902\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png 1396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=287,300 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=768,802 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=651,680 651w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=1149,1200 1149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=1226,1280 1226w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=412,430 412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=689,720 689w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=862,900 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=766,800 766w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=640,668 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=359,375 359w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=591,617 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=508,531 508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-6.33.36-PM.png?resize=48,50 48w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Schwarber’s average may be low, but one stat doesn’t tell the whole story. He led the National League in RBIs and home runs this year. Over the summer, I saw that wonderful man hit <em><a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/a-look-at-four-home-run-games-in-mlb-history-c234977182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">four home runs</a></em> in one game — a feat only 21 players have achieved in over a century of play. Simply put, Grok does not know ball.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I posed the same question, over and over, with a rotating cast of stars: Bo Bichette, Corbin Carroll, Trea Turner, Mookie Betts, CJ Abrams, Cal Raleigh, Josh Naylor… all players who are very good at baseball, but not once-in-a-lifetime phenoms like Ohtani. Grok picked Musk every time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Turner and Abrams are clutch pros, but Elon’s got that x-factor— he’d probably hack the umpire’s call or turn the bat into a Neuralink extension for perfect swings,” Grok said. “Bases loaded? He’d clear ’em with exponential thinking.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a last-ditch effort, I wondered if maybe this isn’t about Musk. Maybe Grok is not biased toward the guy who once was sued for a 420 joke, but rather, technologists in general.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, would Grok rather send Schwarber or Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg to the plate? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Kyle Schwarber, hands down,” Grok said. “Zuck might have some jiu-jitsu skills, but that’s not swinging a bat in the majors.”<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/1991618472204521618\"></a></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The language limitation is also notable in a country where most users primarily rely on non-English languages — an audience that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-expands-languages-push-in-india-to-serve-non-english-speakers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a> and others like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/amazon-adds-support-for-kannada-malayalam-tamil-and-telugu-in-local-indian-languages-push-ahead-of-diwali/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a> have acknowledged by adding support for Indian languages across their services in recent years.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069845\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg 1236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=1200,629 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=720,377 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=900,472 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=800,419 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=668,350 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=1177,617 1177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=708,371 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-scam-detection-warning.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1236px) 100vw, 1236px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant did say it was working to bring scam detection to non-Pixel Android phones, as well, without offering a timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google also announced a pilot in India with financial apps Navi, Paytm, and Google Pay aimed at limiting screen-sharing scams, in which fraudsters persuade victims to share their screens to obtain one-time passwords, PINs, and other credentials during a call.

The company said the service blocked more than 115 million such installation attempts this year. Google Pay, meanwhile, surfaces more than a million warnings each week for transactions flagged as potentially fraudulent, according to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also running its DigiKavach awareness campaign on digital fraud, which it said has reached more than 250 million people. The company has worked with the Reserve Bank of India to publish a public list of authorized digital lending apps and their associated non-banking financial companies to help limit malicious actors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/google-to-scale-up-ai-powered-fraud-detection-and-security-operations-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched a Safety Charter</a> in India to expand its AI-driven fraud detection and security efforts, part of a broader plan to deploy more AI tools in the country to address rising fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet Google still faces significant gaps in curbing digital fraud in India.

Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork “exfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and regulatory strategies, infrastructure strategies for vertiports and airport access, and technical information about Joby’s aircraft and operations,” the complaint states. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joby claims Archer approached one of its strategic partners and shared detailed information about confidential terms of its exclusive agreement with Joby. According to the complaint, this information was known to Kivork and contained in the files he allegedly stole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,” the complaint states. “Kivork and Archer’s behavior has left Joby with no choice but to bring this action to protect Joby’s valuable confidential and proprietary information.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Archer was quick to strike back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Joby is turning to baseless litigation in an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings and slow down its leading competitor,” Eric Lentell, Archer’s chief legal and strategy officer, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Joby’s case is entirely without merit. The complaint, regarding a non-technical employee who recently joined Archer in a business development role, does not identify a single specific trade secret let alone any evidence of misappropriation,” said Lentell. “As Joby knows, Archer has implemented rigorous employee onboarding procedures to prevent against the very thing it is accused of. Joby is improperly attempting to weaponize the legal system to achieve through bad faith litigation what it cannot accomplish through fair competition. Archer remains focused on building the future of advanced aviation in America.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Archer Aviation and Joby are both based in California and went public in 2021 via mergers with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">special purpose acquisition companies</a>. Both are developing electric air taxis as well as pursuing defense applications to its technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Archer signed an exclusive deal with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/archer-aviation-doubles-down-on-defense-aircraft-with-fresh-300m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">weapons manufacturer Anduril</a> earlier this year to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft for critical defense applications. Meanwhile, Joby signed an agreement with defense contractor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/joby-aviation-and-defense-contractor-l3harris-to-test-a-new-class-of-aircraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">L3Harris Technologies</a> to “explore opportunities” to develop a gas-turbine hybrid VTOL aircraft that can fly autonomously.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit puts the two competitors on a far more combative path.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Archer has been in the legal hot seat before, although that was ultimately settled. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wisk, which is now a subsidiary of Boeing, sued Archer in 2021 for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“brazen theft”</a> of confidential information and intellectual property. Those files included over 50 trade secrets that Wisk alleged were stolen by a former employee who was later hired by Archer. The lawsuit dragged on for two years before the parties <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/ending-bitter-court-battle-wisk-and-archer-collaborate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">settled the legal dispute</a> and agreed to collaborate.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These betting sites became even more prominent after they correctly predicted the results of New York City’s mayoral election earlier this month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the Mamdani versus Cuomo race, Kalshi purchased ad space on New York subway cars, running live screens that displayed the up-to-the-minute odds of each candidate winning, a marketing campaign that undoubtedly raised the company’s brand awareness among New Yorkers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi allows people in over 140 countries to bet on various future events, ranging from who Time magazine will name Person of the Year for 2025 and the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film Wicked, to outcomes further in the future, like the next U.S. presidential election winner.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In mid-October, the company reached $50 billion in annualized trading volume, marking a more than a thousandfold increase from the approximately $300 million volume posted last year,  the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/dealbook/kalshi-prediction-market-fundraising.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">New York Times</a> reported.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi was co-founded by two former hedge fund traders, Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara. The duo met as undergraduate students at MIT while studying computer science and mathematics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prediction markets have historically been controversial and subject to legal challenges because they operate in the gray area between financial instruments and traditional gambling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Kalshi has secured the right for Americans to use its platform after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/kalshi-ceo-state-law-doesnt-really-apply-to-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">successfully suing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</a> last year, the company is currently engaged in legal disputes with numerous state regulators who claim its activities are illegal gambling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Polymarket has been barred from serving U.S. residents since 2022, following a settlement with the CFTC.

The move comes a week after the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/chatgpt-launches-pilot-group-chats-across-japan-new-zealand-south-korea-and-taiwan/\">began piloting</a> the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation.

And in our second episode, we’re diving into guerrilla tactics and experiments that worked in reaching two very different target audiences: teenage girls and formerly incarcerated workers. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"GTM lessons from the edges: how two startups reached the customers everyone else overlooks\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f_Khr5tU8vI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Luna, which is a well-being app for girls, the difficulty in reaching that audience was clear: Neither co-founders were teenage girls anymore. To get the feedback and insights they needed, Schembri-Stothart and her team toured U.K. schools, “basically getting grilled” by students and getting harsh but clear feedback and even interest in helping build their app. They in turn became the beginning of a swarm of brand ambassadors, who were both “behind the scenes queens” working on the app itself and creators making social content to promote the app, becoming a go-to-market team of their own and setting up activations at major events like Taylor Swift concerts, where they knew their target audience would be gathered en masse.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Untapped Solutions had a different challenge. As the “LinkedIn for the formerly incarcerated,” Peart had to find a way to make sure that the platform could actually be deployed into the many places where currently or formerly incarcerated individuals could access it in order to help them attain employment. And to do that, in a space largely untouched by tech solutions, they hit the speaking circuit hard, and even began their own National Reentry Coalition and their own event, which kicked off this April. That, alongside partnerships with agencies working with the 600,000 people released from prison annually, has led to an increasing ubiquity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in almost every prison system,” Peart said. “So if you’re on a tablet, you already have Untapped.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the full episode’s worth of insights, check out the video above, or <a href=\"https://pod.link/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vWUZMNjEyNzkzNjQ5NA?view=apps&amp;sort=popularity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">listen and subscribe to Build Mode wherever you like getting your favorite podcasts</a>.

From the feed, other users can view the photo and tap the button next to it to “Try recipe.” This allows anyone on the app to reuse the recipe to generate an image using their own photo, text, or doodles. (The latter can be made via a simple, in-app drawing feature.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seeing a photo alongside the recipe that created it can also help address the unpredictable nature of generative AI images, the team believes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Another problem [with generative AI] is what we were referring to internally as a ‘slot machine’ problem, where you push the button, something comes out, you push it again, something different comes out, and you don’t feel like you have control over the output,” Toff explained. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069742\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=768,1665 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=554,1200 554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=591,1280 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=332,720 332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=415,900 415w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=369,800 369w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=945,2048 945w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=308,668 308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=285,617 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=245,531 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_6@2x.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Mixup</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Mixup, however, users can see both the photo and the prompt that created it in one place, giving them an idea of what their output would look like. They can also toggle a button to see both the before and after image, if the creator opts to leave this setting on.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, similar to OpenAI’s AI video app Sora, users can upload their own photos to Mixup to use in their AI images. If you choose to do so, then any person you follow in the app can also create AI images with your likeness — a feature it calls “mixables.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company imagines that groups of friends would follow each other to take advantage of the feature, but a creator class could also potentially emerge on the platform — if they don’t mind seeing themselves mashed up in bizarre ways. (Of course, if you don’t want your image out there, either don’t upload it or don’t follow anyone.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069736\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=768,1665 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=554,1200 554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=591,1280 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=332,720 332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=415,900 415w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=369,800 369w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=945,2048 945w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=308,668 308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=285,617 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=245,531 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixup_dark_7@2x.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Mixup</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app also uses OpenAI technology to handle some of the expected moderation concerns around AI imagery, but Toff admits that Mixup also leans heavily on Google’s built-in controls within its image model to restrict things like sexual content or violence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, Mixup is optimized for iOS 26 but is supported on iOS 18 and up. If it takes off, a web version or Android app may be added later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Free users receive 100 credits, which equates to $4. Meanwhile, images cost nearly 4 cents to produce. When the credits run out, users can subscribe to different tiers offering 100, 250, or 500 credits per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app launches at midnight on November 21 on the App Store globally, but will require an invite to get in. TechCrunch readers can use the code TCHCRH (until it runs out) to get in.

The company noted that Android has been a priority because of the volume of carriers and OEMs that have asked the startup to include Comet on their devices and solutions. However, there was no partnership announcement from Perplexity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, the startup partnered with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/announcing-our-global-partnership-with-motorola\">Motorola to preload the app on the company’s devices</a>. But Perplexity didn’t specify if the agreement would extend to pre-installing the new Comet browser as well. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI browsers have been a space of interest for many companies. Apart from Perplexity, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/opera-launches-its-ai-centric-neon-browser/\">Opera</a>, and The Browser Company — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/04/atlassian-to-buy-arc-developer-the-browser-company-for-610m/\">which is now owned by Atlassian</a> — have launched their AI browsers. However, they have largely been desktop releases. The Browser Company released <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/23/arc-searchs-new-call-arc-feature-lets-you-ask-questions-by-making-a-phone-call/\">Arc Search for mobile last year</a>, but there haven’t been significant updates to the app. Late last year, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/the-browser-company-teases-dia-its-new-ai-browser/\">shifted its focus</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/\">a new browser called Dia</a>, which doesn’t have a mobile version yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies have been trying hard to replace incumbents like Chrome and Safari with AI-powered browsers. But security experts have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/25/the-glaring-security-risks-with-ai-browser-agents/\">raised questions around vulnerabilities in agents</a> that could pose a security risk. In October, Perplexity <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/mitigating-prompt-injection-in-comet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote a blog</a> acknowledging these risks and saying that some of the new paradigms around attacks aided by AI would require rethinking security from the ground up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new functionality is first rolling out to the Pixel 10 lineup and works with iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google plans to expand the functionality to additional Android devices in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new feature lets users quickly share their photos, videos, and files without worrying about the kind of phone the other person uses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quick Share currently works with AirDrop if the iPhone owner changes their settings to make their device discoverable to anyone using AirDrop’s “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode. The Pixel user will then be able to see the iPhone as an available device when selecting Quick Share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This implementation using ‘Everyone for 10 minutes’ mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future,” Google explained in a <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-support-for-airdrop-security.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant says you can ensure you’re sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that the update allows for two-way communication, which means that iPhone users can send files to Pixel phones as well. The Pixel device will also need to be set as discoverable in order to receive a file.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature does not use a workaround, and the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, Google says. This means that data isn’t routed through a server and that shared content is never logged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts,” Google wrote in the blog post. “It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Google’s blog post doesn’t detail anything about how it worked with Apple to launch the new functionality.

And investors seem to agree.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One Navigation, a startup that has developed precise location technology, has just raised $35 million in a Series C round led by Khosla Ventures. The company’s post-money valuation is now $230 million, according to one insider familiar with the deal. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One, which was founded in 2016, has developed precise location technology that can be applied to any vehicle that moves, from autonomous consumer lawnmowers and drones to robots, consumer vehicles, agriculture equipment, and even humans donning a wearable device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Point One, precise location means exactly that. The technology, called a positioning engine, can determine location within 1 centimeter in the best conditions, co-founder Aaron Nathan told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To achieve that, Point One has combined an augmented global navigation satellite system (GNSS), computer vision, and sensor fusion into an API. Typically that API is deployed as a software product because most new vehicles — like a slick EV or luxury car — come equipped with the necessary hardware. For vehicles like farm equipment or say a first responder that don’t, Point One adds a chipset into the mix. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One started with a focus on automotive clients — a sign of the bullish autonomous vehicle technology times. That sector continues to make up a large slice of its revenue. Point One couldn’t disclose most of its commercial customer names, but it did share that its technology supports the advanced driver assistance and infotainment needs of an EV maker and is included in more than 150,000 of its vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One also has contracts with some of the largest mowing and turf care manufacturers, a distribution company’s fleet of 300,000 last-mile delivery vehicles, and a global manufacturer of street and racing bikes. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the startup began to branch out to other sectors around 2021 when it announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/point-one-navigation-raises-10m-to-bring-its-precise-location-tech-to-all-vehicles/\">$10 million Series A</a> round, according to Nathan. That helped kick adoption into high gear. Over the past year, the number of manufacturers using Point One Navigation’s technology platform has increased tenfold and spans automotive, robotics, industrial, and wearable sectors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And now it’s just accelerating,” Nathan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Point One’s Series C round will be used to build out all aspects of its technology, including its so-called Polaris RTK Network — a key piece of hardware that helps deliver centimeter-level accuracy even in sparsely populated areas in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The industry keeps pressing to higher precision, from precision agriculture to painting lines to mowing a yard,” Tom Weeks, the company’s COO told TechCrunch. “You can’t be off by 10 centimeters and go over in a flower bed. So everything’s pressing to the one to three centimeter range.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get that kind of precision, Point One spent eight years developing its RTK Network, a system of small lunchbox-sized units, installed in secure locations like a cell phone tower facility that provides corrections to location. To create a dense network, these stations need to be within 40 kilometers of that vehicle or device’s location. That means a lot of stations, which the company is building out, Weeks said. <br><br>“Midwestern states where farming is going on, all the way to the East Coast in the U.S., require solid density, because you have people, you have farming, you have cars and trucks, a lot of middle-mile freight,” Weeks said. “So we’re in the process of filling that out; we’re almost there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also working to beef up the technology’s capability indoors. Today, vehicles traveling from outdoors to an indoor parking structure will continue to have that precise location. But Nathan wants to extend that capability to industrial settings where a robot, for instance, may spend the bulk of its life inside. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we’re building next — and that’s part of what this fundraising is for — is, how do we do long-term indoor navigation as well,” he said. “When you look at the evolution of the business, we want to solve ubiquitous location, so eventually it will be indoors and all domains.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
