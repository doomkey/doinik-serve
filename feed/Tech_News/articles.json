She would listen to every podcast and read each book, taking notes on topics that interested her.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She didn’t think much of it until one summer when so many of her friends got married, that she found herself spending thousands of dollars on bridesmaid dresses and bachelorette looks. One day, someone approached her and asked to borrow one of her dresses. “I was like ‘yeah, for sure, take it,’” she recalled. “And then I thought, ‘how can this be done on a larger scale?’” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles had all these expensive dresses just sitting in her closet. She didn’t want to sell it, but she knew she probably would never wear those gowns again. “That’s what led me, long story short, to create Rax,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.raxapp.ca/\">launched Rax earlier</a> this year as a peer-to-peer clothing rental company. It functions right now as a marketplace (it does not own any clothing inventory), where users scroll through listings and connect with people who have clothing items they want to rent.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She’s bootstrapped the company so far, enough to fully code the app and officially launch it. The first few customers were her friends and family, and the rest came by word of mouth. Alles said she leaned into the idea of “building in public,” where she posted online about her adventures creating this product in hopes of amassing an engaged audience of potential customers. She has about 5,000 users on the app right now.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rex is one of the first of its kind to be launched in Toronto. It’s like Rent-the-Runway, or New York’s Pickle, or Europe’s ByRotation. The idea of renting clothes — similar to buying secondhand —has been picking up steam as it is seen as a more environmentally sustainable way to consume fashion rather than buying new items for each new season.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s driving the circularity of fashion,” Alles said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what makes Rex different from many others is that she offers long-term rentals. “On our platform, you can rent up to six months,” she said. “On competitor platforms, it’s daily rentals. So it gets really expensive if you want to rent for a couple week vacation. Or maybe you want a winter jacket for the season.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Rex announced its first foray into the U.S. market. Alles said she had been a huge fan of TechCrunch and applied for the Battlefield competition, where she later won the top consumer pitch in the competition.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles said she was surprised to win. “There were so many companies that had like thousands or hundreds of thousands of users; raised [like] $20 million in my category, and one [had] the lead actors from [the show] Silicon Valley,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, she found the experience “awesome.” Alles went up to every startup booth to introduce herself to other founders, and also attended some sessions as well as partook in networking. Actually, that was one of the biggest lessons she’s said she’s learned as a founder — the importance of in-person interaction because it helps her connect with the community better.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now that Disrupt has passed, Alles said the company hopes to continue its expansion across New York and start building out a rental service platform to offer fashion designers and retailers looking to offer rental clothing to consumers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have the technology, we have the audience,” she said, adding that brands are also looking at ways to become more sustainable, and companies like Rex let them do it. “I think things are getting better and people are becoming more aware of their impact.”  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is piloting IG for TV, a new experience that lets you watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">largely dominates the TV space</a>. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don’t have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reels will also play automatically, so you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch what’s next. You still have the option to skip to the next Reel. You can like, view comments, and re-share reels.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076394\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Instagram</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users have the option to pair IG for TV with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home.

A month later, the startup <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/indias-digantara-establishes-us-operations-for-space-intel-ahead-of-pm-modis-visit/articleshow/118134447.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opened an office in Colorado Springs</a> as part of its push into the U.S. defence market, a move that has since led to contracts with U.S. Space Command for analytics-as-a-service. Its U.S. entity has also been selected for the Missile Defense Agency’s SHIELD contract vehicle, which supports next-generation missile defence programmes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given we’ve already built IR sensors, we are now extending our IR capabilities to other domains like mid- and long-wave infrared,” Sharma told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara has split its operations across geographies to meet national security requirements. Its U.S. team is focused on building larger satellites and spacecraft in the 100-kilogram class tailored to American defence needs, while its India operation concentrates on analytics, data processing, and space situational awareness. The structure reflects the regulatory realities of defence procurement, where sensitive systems must be designed and built domestically for each market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara has so far closed contracts with a combined value of about $25 million, Sharma told TechCrunch. The startup currently operates across India, Singapore, and the U.S., and plans to expand into Europe by setting up a local entity there as early as 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In India, Digantara operates a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility capable of producing up to five satellites simultaneously, and plans to scale that capacity significantly. The startup has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government of Andhra Pradesh to set up a larger facility that could manufacture as many as 30 satellites at once, which it aims to bring online next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara has already been selected as the winning bidder for government defence tenders in India and is completing administrative formalities before work begins, Sharma said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through 2026–27, Digantara plans to expand its space- and ground-based infrastructure, including additional electro-optical and LiDAR satellites for space surveillance, space-based sensors for early missile warning and tracking, and a larger network of ground-based observatories, the company said. It is also exploring the potential use of its LiDAR and laser technologies for future interceptor systems, Sharma asserted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara plans to launch another satellite through SpaceX in March, followed by additional launches in June and October, with multiple satellites scheduled for the latter mission. The company aims to deploy a total of 15 satellites over the next two years, Sharma said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest funding, he noted, will support those launches, with about $7–$10 million earmarked for expansion in the United States and roughly $2–$3 million set aside to establish operations in Europe, while the remainder will be used to scale its India-based manufacturing and operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Digantara has seen revenues grow more than tenfold over the past two years, Sharma said, declining to disclose current figures. He added that the company is targeting annual revenues of $25–$30 million over the next 18 months as defence and government work ramps up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently employs around 125 people, including roughly 80 to 85 engineers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company’s reactors are designed to produce 20 megawatts of electricity, enough to power roughly 15,000 homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has momentum. Last Energy just closed a $100 million Series C led by the Astera Institute with participation from AE Ventures, Galaxy Fund, Gigafund, JAM Fund, The Haskell Company, Ultranative, Woori Technology, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company joins a slew of nuclear startups that have raised funding in recent months, buoyed by data centers’ insatiable power demands. Google-backed X-Energy raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/x-energy-rides-nuclear-wave-raises-700m-series-d/\">$700 million</a> last month, while Antares raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/microreactor-startup-antares-raises-96m-for-land-sea-and-space-based-nuclear-power/\">$96 million</a> two weeks ago. And in August, Aalo Atomics raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/19/aalo-atomics-raises-100m-to-build-a-microreactor-and-data-center-together/\">$100 million</a> to build its prototype reactor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What sets Last Energy apart from competitors is its approach: the company is using an old reactor design developed by the government decades ago. The initial design for the pressurized water reactor was built for the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://maritime.org/tour/savannah/press/part2b.php\">NS Savannah</a>, the world’s first nuclear-powered merchant ship. That ship’s power plant was about one-tenth the size of Last Energy’s planned commercial reactor. Kugelmass said the company’s updated design should produce 20 megawatts of electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is starting smaller, though. First, Last Energy is building a 5-megawatt pilot reactor at a site it’s leasing from Texas A&amp;M. The new funding will fully fund the pilot project and help the company start delivering its first commercial products, Kugelmass said. Last Energy hopes to turn on the pilot reactor next year, with its 20-megawatt commercial-scale unit entering production in 2028.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last Energy’s startup’s reactor isn’t designed to be serviced during its lifetime. Instead, Last Energy is permanently encasing each core in 1,000 tons of steel. Kugelmass estimates the metal will cost around $1 million. “Most people think concrete is cheaper,” he said. “But not when it’s nuclear-grade concrete.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reactors will arrive on site fueled with six years’ worth of uranium. Apart from electrical and control connections, there are no other penetrations that break the steel wall. Heat from the fission reactions warms the steel, and water flowing through pipes on the outside harvests that heat to spin a steam turbine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the reactor’s time is up, Last Energy will leave it on site, with the steel chamber serving as the waste cask, eliminating the need for separate disposal. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hope is that this approach, coupled with manufacturing advances, will drive down the price of nuclear power. Kugelmass wouldn’t commit to a price, instead pointing to other industries that have halved prices for every tenfold increase in production. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think it’s going to be that good in nuclear because there are always some extra fixed costs that you have in nuclear regarding some of the special regulations, but that’s the type of trend you can see,” he said. “We don’t think in ones and twos, we think in tens of thousands.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That’s not a lot of supply for a growing market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.everbloom.bio/\">Everbloom</a>, told TechCrunch. “What you’re seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they’re being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it’s creating unsustainable herding practices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/hyundai-is-working-with-a-startup-on-plant-based-leather-that-smells-like-the-real-thing/\">upcycled material</a> that’s nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.everbloom.bio/braid-ai\">Braid.AI</a>. The model can fine tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its core, Everbloom’s process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: they’re all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom’s process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All the components that we’re using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, it should be cheaper, too. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don’t believe in a ‘sustainable premium’” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That’s what we’re aiming for.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Nordic red-hot startup movement continues. On Tuesday, Neil Murray, founder and general partner at Copenhagen-based firm The Nordic Web Ventures, announced the close of a $6 million Fund III to continue investing in early-stage founders in the region.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund will focus on writing the first institutional checks to companies focused on robotics, AI-native companies, and deep tech founders.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray, a solo GP, told TechCrunch that his first two funds were “test vehicles” to prove his ability to spot and invest in top talent in the region. Now, seven years later, he has written the first check into more than 50 companies, with a portfolio including the unicorn Lovable and the remote worker <a href=\"https://safetywing,/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">insurance company SafetyWing</a>, and exits like the UI design company Uizard.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TechCrunch previously reported, the Nordic ecosystem (which includes Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/breaking-down-the-boom-in-the-nordics-startup-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">is now valued at more than half a trillion dollars</a> and received more than $8 billion in venture funding in 2024, making the region one of the hottest emerging markets in Europe. Murray said Fund III had more than $20 million in investor interest, but he decided to cap it at $6 million because he cares “more about alignment than AUM.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staying small, he said, means he can better tie incentives to performance rather than management fees. He also said staying small, especially as a solo GP, gives him more flexibility while “everyone else is still debating.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Capping the fund wasn’t a constraint,” he said. “It was the strategy.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The check sizes for the fund will be around $200,000, and he hopes to back between 30 and 35 companies. “I believe it is more important to be investing in Tier 1 founders than to back Tier 2 founders and over-optimizing for ownership,” he said.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray’s limited partner base includes institutional backers such as Allocater One, founder Christoph Janz, and Pacenotes. Founders from Kahoot! And Pleo, in addition to operators from Meta and Google, is also LPs in Fund III. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many founders from my first two funds have invested in my new fund, which is also an incredibly important metric to me,” he said, adding that he’s already returned more than half the capital he raised across Fund I and Fund II. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His Fund III focuses on AI, robotics, and consumer, he said, because those are some of the top sectors in the Nordic region. Consumer has always been a top category in the sector, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/the-nordic-startup-scene-has-quietly-become-one-of-techs-fastest-growing-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as TechCrunch previously spoke about</a> on a podcast about the region. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The region is also known for its computer science, engineering culture, and manufacturing, which, paired with a “calm methodical build style,” positions the Nordics well for “AI-powered robotics in industrial, healthcare, logistics, and increasingly consumer context.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though he has a keen interest in the Nordics, Murray actually hails from the UK and moved to Denmark in 2013 without knowing a single person, he recalled. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was very interested in tech startups, having worked in digital products in London,” he continued. When he moved to Copenhagen, he realized the ecosystem has had a big contribution to the tech world, though people hardly spoke up about it. That led him to start the website “The Nordic Web,” where he broke down what was happening behind the curtains of the bugeoning tech scene there. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That website saw him tracking investments and exits and soon, VCs were asking him which founders were looking for capital. Soon, Murray wanted in on the action, and in 2017, launched a $500,000 Fund I. He stopped writing The Nordic Web shortly after to focus more on investing. And all of that has led him here. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, the Nordics aren’t experiencing a ‘moment,’” he said. “They’re experiencing a compounding. The depth of talent, the ambition level, and the maturity of the ecosystem mean this wave isn’t a spike; it’s the foundation of the next decade of Nordic breakout companies.”  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chien compares some of those applications to the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He argued that, just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period was the birth of massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We could be seeing inklings of that stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT, Chien said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elizabeth Weil, founder and partner at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/in-a-crowded-vc-landscape-elizabeth-weils-scribble-ventures-shows-that-networks-still-matter/\">Scribble Ventures</a>, echoed Chien’s sentiment about the early days of GenAI, describing the current state of consumer AI applications as being in an “awkward teenage middle ground.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What will it take for consumer AI startups to grow up? Possibly a new device beyond the smartphone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s unlikely that a device that you pick up 500 times a day but only sees 3% to 5% of what you see is going to be what ultimately introduces the use cases that take full advantage of AI’s capabilities,” Chien said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weil agreed that a smartphone may be too limiting for reimagining consumer AI products in large part because it is not ambient. “I don’t think we’re going to be building for this in five years,” she said, indicating her iPhone as she showed it to the audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups and incumbent tech companies have been racing to build a new personal device that can supplant smartphones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI and Apple’s former design chief, Jony Ive, are working on what’s rumored to be a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/altman-describes-openais-forthcoming-ai-device-as-more-peaceful-and-calm-than-the-iphone/\">“screenless,” pocket-sized device.</a> Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> are controlled by a wristband that detects subtle gestures. Meanwhile, a number of startups are trying, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">with often disappointing results</a>, to introduce a pin, pendant, or ring that uses AI in a way different from how smartphones do.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, not every AI consumer product will be dependent on a new device. Chien suggested that one such offering could be a personal AI financial adviser customized to the user’s specific needs. Similarly, Weil anticipates that a personalized, “always-on” tutor will become ubiquitous, with its specialized tutelage delivered directly from a smartphone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though excited by AI’s potential, Weil and Chien expressed skepticism about the emergence of several, still-stealthy AI-powered social network startups. Chien said these companies are building networks where thousands of AI bots are interacting with the user’s content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It turns social into a single-player game. I’m not sure that it works,” he said. “The reason that people enjoy social networking is the understanding that there are real humans on the other side.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The next video is similar, except that it’s a supercut of us saying “umm” over and over.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, Riverside scans its AI-generated transcripts of your recordings to find what single word you said more than any other (we’re assuming they cut out words like “and” or “the”).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a bit ironic, but on my <a href=\"https://www.wowiftrue.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">podcast about internet culture</a>, my co-host and I said “book” more often than any other word (this was probably skewed by our subscriber-only “book club” recordings… or the fact that my co-host has a book coming out, which we <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/sublimation-isabel-j-kim/75bdbf4afed5475f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plug incessantly</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another show on our podcast network, <a href=\"https://spiritspodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Spirits</a>, said “Amanda” more often than any other word (not because they’re obsessed with me, but because they also have a host named Amanda).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the podcast network’s Slack, we exchanged our Rewind videos. There’s something inherently funny about a video of people saying “umm” over and over. But we also know what these videos represent: our creative tools are becoming more saturated with AI features, many of which we do not want or need. The Riverside Rewind points to the uselessness of these tools themselves — why would I need a video of my co-host and I saying the word “book” over and over? It’s good for a quick laugh, but there’s no substance.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though I enjoyed Riverside’s AI recap, its arrival comes at a time when my industry peers are losing opportunities to create, edit, and produce new podcasts, thanks to the same AI tools that generated our Rewind videos. But while AI allows us to automate away some tasks — like editing out our “umms” and dead air — podcasting itself is not that mechanical. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI can quickly generate a transcript of my podcast, which is important for accessibility reasons, helping to automate an activity that used to be incredibly time-consuming and tedious. However, AI is not able to make editorial choices around how to maneuver audio or video to tell a story effectively. Unlike the human editors I work with, AI cannot determine when a tangential conversation in a podcast is funny and when it should be cut because it’s boring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the rise of personalized AI audio tools, like Google’s NotebookLM, its ability to serve as a creation tool has also seen high-profile failures, as of late. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, The Washington Post started to roll out personalized, AI-generated podcasts about the news of the day. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can see why this would seem like a “good” idea to profit-hungry execs — instead of paying a team to do the intensive work of researching, recording, editing, and distributing a daily show, you could automate it — except you can’t. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The podcasts spouted <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/12/11/2025/washington-posts-ai-generated-podcasts-rife-with-errors-fictional-quotes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made-up quotes</a> and factual errors, which is existentially dangerous for a news organization. According to Semafor, the Post’s internal testing found that <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/12/14/2025/iterate-through-why-the-washington-post-launched-an-error-ridden-ai-product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">between 68% and 84% </a>of the AI podcasts failed to meet the publication’s standards. This seems like a fundamental misinterpretation of how LLMs work. You can’t train an LLM to distinguish reality from fiction because it’s designed to provide the most statistically probable output to a prompt, which is not always the most truthful output — especially in breaking news.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Riverside did a great job making a fun end-of-year product, but it’s also a reminder. AI is infiltrating every industry, including podcasting.

The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-signs-deal-with-openai-to-allow-sora-to-generate-ai-videos-featuring-its-characters/\">signed the partnership</a> with OpenAI last week that will bring its iconic characters to the AI firm’s Sora video generator. Once that exclusive year is up, Disney is free to sign similar deals with other AI companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal gives OpenAI a high-profile content partner, allowing users to draw on more than 200 characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars to create content on Sora. For now, it’s the only AI platform that’s legally permitted to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Disney, the deal offers a way to test the waters with generative AI and its intellectual property, letting the company assess how its partnership with OpenAI goes before pursuing additional agreements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“No human generation has ever stood in the way of technological advance, and we don’t intend to try,” Iger told CNBC. “We’ve always felt that if it’s going to happen, including disruption of our current business models, then we should get on board.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tellingly, the same day that Disney announced its deal with OpenAI, the company sent a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-hits-google-with-cease-and-desist-claiming-massive-copyright-infringement/\">cease-and-desist letter to Google</a>, alleging that the tech giant has infringed on its copyrights.

The company plans to keep investing in the technology and “accelerate” its access to different systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The semiconductor company also released a new family of open AI models on Monday. The company claimed this group of models, called <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-debuts-nemotron-3-family-of-open-models/?nvid=nv-int-cwmfg-574873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nvidia Nemotron 3</a>, is the most “efficient family of open models” for building accurate AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This model family includes the Nemotron 3 Nano, a small model for targeted tasks, the Nemotron 3 Super, a model built for multi-AI agent applications, and Nemotron 3 Ultra, built for more complicated tasks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Open innovation is the foundation of AI progress,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, wrote in the company’s press release. “With Nemotron, we’re transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In recent months, Nvidia has pushed to bolster its open source and open AI offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, the company announced a new open reasoning vision language model, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/nvidia-announces-new-open-ai-models-and-tools-for-autonomous-driving-research/\">Alpamayo-R1</a>, which is focused on autonomous driving research.

Those storage systems, which will use cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries, will be used to power data centers and help buffer demand on the electric grid. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford says the battery storage systems will start shipping in 2027 and that the company plans to build 20GWh of annual capacity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford will invest about $2 billion into the new business over the next two years. Under the plan, Ford will repurpose the existing manufacturing capacity at its Kentucky factory. Ford plans to produce LFP batteries using technology licensed from China’s CATL, as well as battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford will join a number of automakers that are operating in or planning to enter the battery storage space. Tesla has spent the last decade selling battery storage products and deploys around 10GWh every quarter. General Motors also has a set of home and commercial <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/gm-teams-up-with-redwood-materials-to-power-data-centers-with-ev-batteries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">battery storage products</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lisa Drake, vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems at Ford, said the “predominant” opportunity for the new business will be commercial grid customers. But data centers will be secondary, and then Ford expects to offer some home storage products, Drake said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was clear when we went out to the market that the technology of choice for most of these customers was an LFP prismatic type of container system,” Drake said during a call with reporters. “And given the fact that we already had a license to build that technology in the U.S., you couple that with our manufacturing experience over a century of high-scale manufacturing, it just made a lot of sense as a natural adjacency for us.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford’s BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall, which is slated to begin production of LFP batteries in 2026, is still on track, the company said. Those LFP batteries, which also use CATL tech, will be used in Ford’s upcoming mid-sized electric truck. There will be one adjustment at the Michigan factory, however. Ford said it will also be used to make smaller Amp-hour cells for use in “residential energy storage solutions,” suggesting that Ford’s plan will go beyond commercial customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan has gone through several iterations in its abbreviated life. In February 2023, Ford said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/13/ford-to-build-3-5b-factory-catl/\">invest $3.5 billion</a> to build the factory to make LFP batteries for its growing portfolio of electric vehicles. Ford abruptly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/25/ford-halts-work-on-3-5b-ev-battery-factory-with-chinas-catl/\">halted construction</a> on the factory in September 2023. Two months later, it announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/21/ford-downsizes-ev-battery-factory-plan/\">dialed-back plan</a> with a production capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours, about 43% smaller than planned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In its place, Ford will sell what’s known as an “extended range electric vehicle” version of the truck, which adds a gas generator that can recharge the battery pack to power the motors for over 700 miles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company did not share when the new F-150 Lightning will go on sale, or how much it will cost. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pivot will come with a substantial price tag for Ford. The company will take a $19.5 billion hit to reshape its EV business strategy. Most of those charges, including an $8.5 billion writedown of its EV assets, will be recorded in the fourth quarter. Ford said $5.5 billion in cash is to be charged through 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shakeup affects numerous factories and workers. It also means Ford’s next-generation all-electric truck — internally dubbed “T3” — is now dead. The T3 was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/ford-to-build-next-gen-ev-truck-at-5-6b-factory-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">supposed to be a clean-sheet design,</a> as opposed to the Lightning, which had electric vehicle technology that was shoehorned into a gas vehicle design. Ford confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s also abandoning <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2025/08/07/ford-delay-ev-electric-full-size-pickup-truck-t3-commercial-van-blueoval-city/85563663007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plans</a> for a next-generation commercial van. The current model, the E-Transit, will continue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,” the company wrote in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is still planning on releasing a mid-sized all-electric pickup truck in 2027, the company confirmed Monday. The platform that powers that truck — born out of a skunkworks program led by former Tesla executives Doug Field and Alan Clarke — will also underpin other future Ford vehicles. Ford said it is still on track to begin producing cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries in 2026. Those LFP batteries, which will be built at the BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall and use technology licensed from China’s CATL, will be used in the mid-sized truck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas, more trucks and van hybrids, extended-range electric vehicles, affordable EVs, and entirely new opportunities like energy storage,” Ford president Andrew Frick said on a call with reporters.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed</a> the F-150 Lightning in 2021, two years after it first announced plans for an all-electric Mustang, the Mach-E. Ford teased a $40,000 price tag for the Lightning, which was meant to be a flagship product for the company’s $22 billion push into electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like most large electric trucks, though, the F-150 Lightning struggled in the U.S. market. Part of that was because the $40,000 price tag never materialized for most buyers, as that base trim was targeted specifically at fleet customers. Ford wound up selling <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/gmc-hummer-ev-outsold-the-tesla-cybertruck-last-quarter/\">around 7,000 Lightnings per quarter</a> over the last two years, with a peak of nearly 11,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EVs have faced a lot of headwind since the F-150 Lightning was first introduced. Tesla kicked off a dramatic price war to counter falling sales, which ate into legacy automakers’ thin (or negative) margins. The reelection of Donald Trump, along with Republicans taking control of Congress, has led to a reversal of many Biden-era policies meant to encourage the sale of electric vehicles.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In July, the organization <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2025/06/25/introducing-cc-signals-a-new-social-contract-for-the-age-of-ai/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=introducing-cc-signals-a-new-social-contract-for-the-age-of-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> a plan to provide a legal and technical framework for dataset sharing between companies that control the data and the AI providers that want to train on it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the nonprofit is tentatively backing pay-to-crawl systems, saying it is “cautiously supportive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls,” a CC <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2025/12/12/where-cc-stands-on-pay-to-crawl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post said</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spearheaded by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-launches-a-marketplace-that-lets-websites-charge-ai-bots-for-scraping/\">companies like Cloudflare</a>, the idea behind pay-to-crawl would be to charge AI bots every time they scrape a site to collect its content for model training and updates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, websites freely allowed web crawlers to index their content for inclusion into search engines like Google. They benefited from this arrangement by seeing their sites listed in search results, which drove visitors and clicks. With AI technology, however, the dynamic has shifted. After a consumer gets their answer via an AI chatbot, they’re unlikely to click through to the source.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This shift has already been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/googles-ai-overviews-are-killing-traffic-for-publishers/\">devastating for publishers</a> by killing search traffic, and it shows no sign of letting up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A pay-to-crawl system, on the other hand, could help publishers recover from the hit AI has had on their bottom line. Plus, it could work better for smaller web publishers that don’t have the pull to negotiate one-off content deals with AI providers. Major deals have been struck between companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/20/openai-signs-deal-to-train-on-conde-nast-content-surface-stories-in-chatgpt/\">OpenAI and Condé Nast</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/openai-inks-deal-with-axel-springer-on-licensing-news-for-model-training/\">Axel Springer</a> and others; as well as between <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407814/gannett-couples-up-with-perplexity-they-sign-cont.html?edition=139351\">Perplexity and Gannett</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/business/media/new-york-times-amazon-ai-licensing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon and The New York Times</a>; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/meta-signs-commercial-ai-data-agreements-with-publishers-to-offer-real-time-news-on-meta-ai/\">Meta and various media publishers</a>, <a href=\"https://futureweek.com/a-complete-list-of-publishers-striking-ai-content-licensing-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">among</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/microsoft-starts-paying-publishers-for-content-in-copilot/\">others</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CC offered several caveats to its support for pay-to-crawl, noting that such systems could concentrate power on the web. It could also potentially block access to content for “researchers, nonprofits, cultural heritage institutions, educators, and other actors working in the public interest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It suggested a series of principles for responsible pay-to-crawl, including not making pay-to-crawl a default setting for all websites and avoiding blanket rules for the web. In addition, it said that pay-to-crawl systems should allow for throttling, not just blocking, and should preserve public interest access.

The 25-year-old venture firm announced Monday that it raised a total of <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251215319417/en/Lightspeed-Closes-Over-%249B-in-New-Funds-Aimed-at-Backing-Category-Definers-Worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$9 billion</a> in fresh funds, the largest fundraise in firm’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At a time when very few companies have managed to IPO, Lightspeed was an early investor in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/25/rubriks-shares-climb-20-in-its-public-debut/\">Rubrik</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/netskope-follows-rubrik-as-a-rare-cybersecurity-ipo-both-backed-lightspeed/\">Netskope</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/navan-ipo-tumbles-20-after-historic-debut-under-sec-shutdown-workaround/\">Navan</a>, all of which have recently made their public market debuts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm has also positioned itself as a predominantly AI-focused investor. Lightspeed claims to have backed 165 AI-native companies, including Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Mistral, Glean, Abridge, and Skild AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Armed with its giant new fund, the firm can continue to make massive investments into capital-intensive AI companies. For instance, Lightspeed reportedly wrote a $1 billion check to Anthropic when it co-led the LLM-maker’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">$13 billion</a> investment in September.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightspeed’s new capital is spread across six funds, including a $3.3 billion opportunity fund dedicated to follow-on investments in its fastest-growing portfolio companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other large VC firms that have recently raised enormous capital pools include Founders Fund, which earlier this year amassed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/founders-funds-new-4-6b-fund-indicates-an-era-of-big-vc-spending/\">$4.6 billion</a> for a growth fund, as well as General Catalyst’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/general-catalyst-raises-8b-in-fresh-funds-to-back-startups-globally/\">$8 billion</a> capital haul and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/andreessen-horowitzs-7-2b-new-funds-for-a-new-era/\">Andreessen Horowitz’s $7.2 billion</a>, both secured in 2024.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, younger and smaller VC firms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/our-funds-are-20-years-old-a-look-inside-the-liquidity-crisis-reshaping-venture-capital/\">are struggling</a> to attract fresh funds.

Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past 12 months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dictionary<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> defines the term</a> as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like <em>slime</em>, <em>sludge</em>, and <em>muck</em>, <em>slop</em> has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">OpenAI’s Sora</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/googles-veo-2-video-generator-comes-to-gemini/\">Google Gemini’s Veo</a> are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials — even entire movies. One study in May<a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-percentage-of-new-content-is-ai-generated/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> claimed that</a> nearly 75% of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">can be milked for advertising money</a>. Critics <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04755\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">worry that</a> this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which — as you might imagine — can be quite light on informational value. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But “slop” has also been used to describe AI’s impact on a large variety of fields that don’t have much to do with traditional media consumption, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-slop-and-fake-reports-are-exhausting-some-security-bug-bounties/\">cybersecurity reports</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/business/lawyers-ai-vigilantes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legal briefings</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/magazine/ai-higher-education-students-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the college essay</a>, among other things. Its impact is broad, to say the least.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relatedly, tech words have been <a href=\"https://time.com/7334730/word-of-the-year-2025-cambridge-collins-dictionary-oxford-merriam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">big winners in the WOTY (word of the year) category</a> this year. Macquarie Dictionary already beat out Merriam-Webster to make “AI slop” its annual term, while Oxford Dictionary chose “ragebait.” Collins Dictionary went with “vibe coding.”   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
