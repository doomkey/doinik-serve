            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mobileye made its name, and money, by supplying automakers with millions of computer vision chips designed to support automotive safety features and advanced driver assistance systems. The Intel subsidiary and publicly traded company later expanded to tackle autonomous driving through its chips and software. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, co-founder and president Amnon Shashua is taking the company into what he calls Mobileye 3.0. And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics — a startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/a-humanoid-robot-is-on-its-way-from-mobileye-founder/\">co-founded by Shashua</a> in 2022 — for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board’s consideration and approval, according to the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye’s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,” Shashua said Tuesday. “By combining Mentee’s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye’s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits for Mobileye aren’t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition “broadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.” Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline — driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech — is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye’s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure — aka compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a “top 10 automaker” struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bill, dubbed SB 867, comes in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/trumps-ai-executive-order-promises-one-rulebook-startups-may-get-legal-limbo-instead/\">President Trump’s recent executive order</a> directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past year, lawsuits filed by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/lawsuit-blames-character-ai-in-death-of-14-year-old-boy/\">families</a> whose children <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\">died by suicide</a> after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots/\">passed SB 243</a>, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/folotoy-ai-bear-suspended-explicit-advice.html#:~:text=A.I.,of%20unexpected%20and%20unsafe%20chatter.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PIRG Education Fund warned </a>that toys like Kumma — a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot — could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-toys-gift-present-safe-kids-robot-child-miko-grok-alilo-miiloo-rcna246956\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NBC News found</a> that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/openai-and-barbie-maker-mattel-team-up-to-bring-generative-ai-to-toy-making-and-content-creation/\">“AI-powered product” in 2025</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/15/mattel-openai-toys-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delayed</a> their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-musical-lollipop-that-plays-ice-spice-in-your-head\">A musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080428\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=768,344 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=668,299 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=708,317 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Lollipop Star</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? <a href=\"https://www.lollipopstar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lollipop Star</a> showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth.

It will be built off of the company’s Intel Core Series 3 processors, known as Panther Lake, which was announced last year and is now being rolled out in a variety of PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This future platform includes a chip specifically for handheld gaming devices, according to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-intel-is-making-its-own-handheld-gaming-pc-chips-at-ces-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting from IGN</a>, which was confirmed by TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These Panther Lake chips are the company’s first built on its <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/intel-unveils-panther-lake-architecture-first-ai-pc-platform-built-on-18a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">18A </a>manufacturing process, which started production in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intel is no stranger to the gaming industry and has been building chips for gaming PCs since the 1990s. The company leaned more heavily into gaming in 2022 with the release of its <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Intel Arc GPUs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Entering the handheld gaming space would be an interesting development, though, as the market is currently dominated by AMD. AMD just announced a new processor designed for gaming PCs, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/amd-unveils-new-ai-pc-processors-for-general-use-and-gaming-at-ces/\">AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D</a>, in its CES keynote on Monday, in addition to new ray tracing and graphics technologies for gaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogers said Intel will share more details about its new products for handheld gaming devices later this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-for-the-first-official-day-with-ring-mobileye-siemens-robots-ai-and-more/\">annual CES conference</a> here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The round was led by Felicis and the university’s fund, UC Investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/lm-arena-the-organization-behind-popular-ai-leaderboards-lands-100m/\">$100 million seed round in May</a> at a $600 million valuation. This new round means it raised $250 million in about seven months.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LMArena is best known for its crowdsourced AI model performance leaderboards. Its consumer website lets a user type a prompt that it sends to two models, with the user then choosing which model did a better job. Those results, which now span more than 5 million monthly users across 150 countries and 60 million conversations a month, the company says, fuel the leaderboards. It ranks various models on a variety of tasks including text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other criteria.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models it tests include various flavors of OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Grok, as well as ones that are geared toward specialties like image generation, text to image, or reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company began as Chatbot Arena, an open research project built by UC Berkeley researchers Anastasios Angelopoulos and Wei-Lin Chiang, and was originally funded through grants and donations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LMArena’s leaderboards became something of an obsession among model makers. When LMArena started pursuing revenue, it partnered with select model companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make their flagship models available for its community to evaluate. In April, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/study-accuses-lm-arena-of-helping-top-ai-labs-game-its-benchmark/\">a group of competitors published a paper</a> alleging that this helped those model makers game the startup’s benchmarks, an allegation LMArena has vehemently denied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, it publicly launched a commercial service, <a href=\"https://news.lmarena.ai/ai-evaluations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Evaluations</a>, in which enterprises, model labs, and developers can hire the company to perform model evaluations through its community. This gave LMArena an annualized “consumption rate” — as the company describes its annual recurring revenue (ARR) — of $30 million as of December, less than four months after launch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That trajectory, and the startup’s popularity, were enough for VCs to pile in for the Series A, which included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, The House Fund, LDVP, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Laude Ventures.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

HSI began investigating pcTattletale in mid-2021 as part of a wider probe into the industry of consumer-grade surveillance software, also known as “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#stalkerware\">stalkerware</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the first successful U.S. federal prosecution of a stalkerware operator in more than a decade, following the 2014 indictment and subsequent guilty plea of the creator of a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/seller-stealthgenie-cellphone-spyware-fined-500-000-n256311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">phone surveillance app called StealthGenie</a>. Fleming’s conviction could pave the way for further federal investigations and prosecutions against those operating spyware, but also those who simply advertise and sell covert surveillance software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HSI said that pcTattletale is one of several stalkerware websites under investigation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Kelly Thornton, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, which brought the charges against Fleming, declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming’s lawyer Marcus Bourassa did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">pcTattletale was a remote surveillance app that had been under Fleming’s control since at least 2016. Stalkerware apps like pcTattletale allow ordinary consumers to buy software capable of tracking people and their data without their knowledge, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\">including romantic partners and spouses</a>, which is illegal in the United States and many other countries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once physically planted on a person’s phone or computer (usually with knowledge of the victim’s passcode or login), the app would continuously upload a copy of the victim’s information, including messages, photos, and location data, to pcTattletale’s servers and make the data accessible to whoever planted the spyware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/pctattletale-spyware-shutters-data-breach/\">shut down pcTattletale</a> in 2024 following a data breach, which saw a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/25/spyware-app-pctattletale-was-hacked-and-its-website-defaced/\">hacker deface the company’s website and steal reams of data</a> from its servers, including identifiable information belonging to its customers and their victims. More than 138,000 customers who had signed up to use pcTattletale had their breached information shared with <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/pcTattletale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, Fleming told TechCrunch that his company was “out of business and completely done,” after deleting the contents of pcTattletale’s servers.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the shutdown, federal agents were already far into their investigation of Fleming’s illegal spyware business.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-feds-search-founder-s-1-2m-home\"><strong>Feds search founder’s $1.2M home</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HSI began investigating pcTattletale in June 2021 after finding over 100 stalkerware websites offering surveillance products, many of which advertised lawful uses of the software, such as monitoring children or employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">pcTattletale stood out because it was specifically advertising its spyware for “surreptitiously spying on spouses and partners,” wrote HSI special agent Nick Jones in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26458012-bryan-fleming-search-warrant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the 2022 affidavit</a> in support of a search warrant for Fleming’s home. The affidavit was unsealed in early December 2025 ahead of Fleming’s anticipated plea hearing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially for investigators, Fleming was believed to be operating pcTattletale from his home in Bruce Township, Michigan, well within reach of U.S. law enforcement — unlike many overseas stalkerware operators who are not.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike some stalkerware operators who shield their identities to avoid legal and reputational risks from working with spyware, Fleming was brazen in how he advertised pcTattletale. In <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260105175022/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5uCPlUg2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">videos posted</a> on YouTube, Fleming could be seen at his home promoting pcTattletale as its creator and founder. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg\" alt=\"A surveillance photo taken by HSI agents showing Bryan Fleming's home in Michigan.\" class=\"wp-image-3080226\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg 1183w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=430,307 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=720,514 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=900,642 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=800,571 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=668,477 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=526,375 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=865,617 865w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=708,505 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1183px) 100vw, 1183px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A surveillance photo taken by HSI agents outside of Bryan Fleming’s home in Michigan</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Justice Department (affidavit)</span></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the affidavit, HSI obtained a warrant in 2022 allowing the search of Fleming’s email accounts. HSI said the emails showed that Fleming “knowingly assisted customers seeking to spy on nonconsenting, non-employee adults.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Federal agents later surveilled Fleming’s home to confirm it was in fact him. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jones also went undercover to collect evidence, posing as an affiliate marketer under the guise of promoting the spyware in exchange for a cut of the proceeds. As a result of this operation, Jones exchanged emails with Fleming, in which the pcTattletale founder provided images intended for banner ads that promoted the spyware as a way to “catch a cheater,” which made it clear Fleming wanted to market his product for illegal purposes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By November 2022, HSI had obtained permission from a U.S. judge to search Fleming’s home, which agents raided soon after, seizing an unknown number of items. Agents also obtained records associated with Fleming’s bank and his PayPal account, which had transactions totaling more than $600,000 as of the end of 2021. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The search warrant was filed under seal amid concerns that Fleming could destroy or tamper with evidence. Fleming has since sold the house for $1.2 million, <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/69951-Wildflower-Ln-18_Bruce-Twp_MI_48065_M99434-29527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per public records</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming’s conviction is a win for privacy advocates and campaigners who work to counter the proliferation of stalkerware and raise awareness to its dangers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the co-founder of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, who has investigated and fought stalkerware for years, commented on Fleming’s guilty plea when reached by TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the most striking aspects of this case is the extent to which stalkware companies like pcTattletale operate out in the open,” said Galperin. “This is because the people behind these companies so rarely face consequences for selling tools that they themselves say are explicitly for monitoring other people’s devices without their knowledge or consent.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I hope that this case changes the risk calculus for makers of stalkerware,” said Galperin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming is expected to be sentenced later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-paragraph\">——</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence.

While that’s not sports tech per se, health and biotech are a natural niche for an athlete interested in human performance and wellness — and who has the freedom to pursue unconventional opportunities in those fields.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2020, Götze made headlines for <a href=\"https://cannareporter.eu/en/2021/01/13/gotze-and-schurrle-invest-in-german-medical-cannabis-start-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investing in German cannabis startup Sanity Group</a> when most European institutional investors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/13/8-cannabis-investors-share-their-outlook-on-the-european-market-in-h1-2022/\">wouldn’t touch cannabis with a 10-foot pole</a>. Since then, Germany has <a href=\"https://fortune.com/europe/2024/12/24/german-medical-cannabis-companies-predicted-to-bring-1-billion-2028/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">liberalized some aspects of its cannabis laws</a>, creating tailwinds for the startup that claimed <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240624359101/en/Organigram-Invests-in-Sanity-Group-a-Leading-German-Cannabis-Company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a 10% share</a> of the German medical cannabis market in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With cannabis still forbidden for athletes in competition, Götze will have to wait to try the stuff himself: The 33-year-old is still playing professionally at the top league level with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. But rather than waiting for retirement, he is taking cues from American athlete-investors such as NBA champion <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/how-living-in-silicon-valley-has-made-kevin-durant-a-better-investor/\">Kevin Durant</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Götze is not the only active European soccer player who also invests in startups — for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé <a href=\"https://athleticoventures.substack.com/p/insights-about-athlete-investors-53e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also do</a>. But as the father of two young daughters, he has to balance his various commitments. “I have to schedule calls before or after practices and align meetings with weeks when I don’t have away games or play Champions League,” Götze <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mario-goetze_how-to-combine-soccer-and-venture-in-one-activity-7406288512964243458-0lQD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Götze isn’t doing it all himself, but he is not simply entrusting others with his money either. Instead, he created Companion M as a small team that supports him with angel investing, partnerships, and other tasks. “These are important for myself as a brand, particularly in the long term, after [my] active career,” he <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mario-goetze_the-swiss-army-knife-or-an-army-of-experts-activity-7399817939773968385--sWV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">explained</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is an undeniable branding aspect to these efforts. When Götze became Revolut’s first-ever brand ambassador for Germany, the fintech company <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/revolut_were-pleased-to-announce-mario-g%C3%B6tze-as-activity-7237093412569575424-Igiv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cited</a> his track record as an angel investor as an incentive. But while preparing for his post-soccer career, Götze has found what he <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mario-goetze_being-a-professional-athlete-its-not-apparent-activity-7401614544554401793-KuNv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">describes</a> as “another passion apart from sport.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This passion may be less unexpected than it seems. While Götze and his brothers all became soccer players, their father Jürgen is a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of TU Dortmund University, and the family spent time in Houston, Texas, when Jürgen was visiting Rice University as a postdoctoral researcher.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not coincidentally, Götze mostly invests in Europe and in the U.S., with past investments including Miami-based <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/arcee-is-a-secure-enterprise-focused-platform-for-building-genai/\">Arcee AI</a> and Frankfurt-based <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/10/qualifyze-swallows-54m-to-improve-pharmaceutical-supply-chains/\">Qualifyze</a>. Several portfolio companies went on to raise significant amounts of follow-on funding, and he has already exited some, such as Berlin-based <a href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2024/11/berlin-based-koro-secures-e35-million-in-series-c-funding-to-drive-european-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">KoRo</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Exits give Götze capital to reinvest, but he’s also focused on long-term wealth consolidation. As a limited partner, Companion <a href=\"https://www.companion-m.com/funds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">backed more than 20 venture capital firms</a> on both sides of the Atlantic, including 20VC, Cherry Ventures, EQT Ventures, Planet A, Merantix, Visionaries Club, and World Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Götze is still under contract with his club and is reportedly <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/eintracht-frankfurt-mario-g-tze-203400931.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">discussing an extension</a>. But whenever he finally retires, these venture firms could count him as a peer. “After my career ends, I plan to focus on my investment activities,” he told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-29/german-football-star-mario-goetze-chases-gains-off-the-field\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>. But even then, don’t expect him to publish his anti-portfolio of startups he passed on and that later became huge successes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are plenty of new startups every year, and there will be some that you miss out on. But regretting past decisions leads to making uneducated or impulsive decisions in the future,” he told TechCrunch. Spoken like a true sportsman: Dwelling on what you missed won’t help you score the next goal.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A spokesperson for Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is internally prototyping the game and that it’s not available to the public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The game was first spotted by reverse engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2007873391865339907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development. Paluzzi shared a screenshot of the basketball game, which appears to let users virtually shoot hoops by swiping their finger. The idea behind the game is likely to allow friends to compete to see who can score the most baskets, similar to other mobile basketball games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launching in-message games would give Threads an edge over competitors like X and Bluesky, which don’t offer built-in games. It could also even help Threads compete with Apple’s Messages, which supports games via third-party apps like GamePigeon.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with any internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Meta plans to officially roll out games in Threads messages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time Meta has explored in-message gaming, as Instagram launched a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/bored-go-play-this-hidden-game-in-your-instagram-dms/\">hidden emoji game in DMs last year</a>. The goal of the game is to use your finger to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep an emoji of your choice afloat and continuously bouncing. If you let the emoji fall, you lose. The idea is to compete with the other person in the chat to achieve the highest score.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The internal prototype comes as Meta continues to build out Threads with new features to take on its competitors. For example, the platform recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/threads-adds-new-communities-tests-badges-for-highly-engaged-members/\">expanded its Communities feature</a> with more topics, likely aiming to draw users away from Reddit and X. Plus, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/threads-adds-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours-and-responses-go-to-dms/\">added a “disappearing posts”</a> feature that lets users share their thoughts and engage in conversations that are automatically archived after 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Threads boasts 400 million monthly users, it still has quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/11/20/americans-social-media-use-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pew Research Center’s report released a few weeks ago</a>. The report says 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">CFS and its competitors</a> are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Key components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"An engineer stands inside a superconducting magnet.\" class=\"wp-image-3080253\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Each magnet weighs 24 tons and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Commonwealth Fusion Systems</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/bill-gates-backed-commonwealth-fusion-systems-hits-key-reactor-construction-milestone/\">set in place last March</a>. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"An illustration shows a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor\" class=\"wp-image-3080254\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=2048,1154 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=1095,617 1095w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">CFS is working with Nvidia and Siemens to produce a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Commonwealth Fusion Systems</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">$863 million Series B2</a> round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks.

They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/watch-duty-surpasses-chatgpt-as-top-free-app-on-app-store-as-california-fires-spread/\">the fire monitoring app Watch Duty</a> to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the new devices being launched support Amazon’s Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company’s Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren’t in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions, and clothing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For people who subscribe to Amazon’s Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/amazons-new-alexa-feature-adds-conversational-ai-to-ring-doorbells/\">trigger Alexa responses</a> and send you <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Narwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080177\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Narwal</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean themselves. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee they will listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Narwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?w=318\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080178\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg 4136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=140,300 140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=768,1644 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=318,680 318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=560,1200 560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=598,1280 598w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=201,430 201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=336,720 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=420,900 420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=374,800 374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=717,1536 717w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=956,2048 956w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=312,668 312w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=175,375 175w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=288,617 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=248,531 248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Narwal</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41 kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal.

I’m trying to change that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lowry began working at Insight Partners in 2022, after previously working for Meta, McKinsey &amp; Company, and an early-stage startup. The suit alleges that, upon being hired, she was assigned to a different supervisor than the person mentioned during her interview.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She alleges in the suit that she was told by her new supervisor, who was a woman, to be “online all the time, including PTO, holidays, and weekends,” and to respond between “6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lowry says in the suit that this first supervisor “berated, hazed, and antagonized” her, spoke openly about a hazing that would be “longer and more intense” than what she put other male reports through.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some comments the supervisor allegedly made, according to the suit, include “you are incompetent, shut up and take notes” and “you need to obey me like a dog; do whatever I say whenever I say it, without speaking.”  Lowry also alleges that her supervisor assigned her “redundant tasks” and restricted her ability to participate in calls, while allowing less experienced male colleagues to do so. Lowry, instead, she alleges, was relegated to “administrative tasks such as note-taking and cataloging.”  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lowry said she became “increasingly ill” because of the work environment and that her physician advised a medical leave of absence, which she was granted and took from February to July 2023.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When she returned to work, she was placed on a new team and, the suit alleges, was told by the head of human resources that “if the new team did not like her, she would be fired.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September 2023, Lowry said she got a concussion and took another medical leave and returned to work near the end of 2024. Due to some departures, she was placed under the supervision of a new person, where Lowry said her poor treatment continued. She also alleges that in 2024, her compensation was about 30% below the market. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By April 2025, she alleges she was told her compensation would be cut. In May of 2025, through her attorneys, Lowry sent a letter to Insight regarding her alleged treatment by the company. A week later, the firm terminated her employment, the suit states.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit is reminiscent of Ellen Pao’s suit against Kleiner Perkins back in 2012, in which she alleged discrimination and retaliation. That suit offered what was, at the time, a rare glimpse into how women partners felt they were treated in venture capital. Though Pao lost that suit, it sent waves through the industry, and <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/former-employee-sues-facebook-for-sex-and-race-discrimination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other women went on to sue</a> major tech companies.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\">replacing human labor</a> as a way to price it, and justify its expense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/ai-job-predictions-become-corporate-americas-newest-competitive-sport/\">could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs</a>, raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ln3PTyByci0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an interview on 60 Minutes</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">checking the AI’s work for accuracy</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing <a href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Project Iceberg</a>, which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is <a href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/#faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">how much of a job can be offloaded to AI</a>. It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the <a href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tasks it cites as examples</a> include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called <a href=\"https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Blood in the Machine</a>. Then there are the high unemployment rates among <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/10/the-computer-science-dream-has-become-a-nightmare/\">new-grad junior coders</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers, and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. <a href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/isg_vemo_2026.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report</a> found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/microsoft-satya-nadella-memo-layoffs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 15,000 people in 2025</a>, even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html#:~:text=Financially%2C%20it%20was%20a%20year,We%20take%20neither%20for%20granted.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last fiscal year, which closed in June</a> — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a<a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> public memo</a> about the layoffs after these results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-says-companys-mission-193700847.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">did say</a> that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/ai-job-cuts-amazon-microsoft-and-more-cite-ai-for-2025-layoffs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC reported.</a> That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, and other tech companies chasing AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses</a>, too.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, the companies said the robotaxi is already being tested on public roads ahead of a planned commercial service launching in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on the Lucid Gravity SUV, the robotaxi has high-resolution cameras, solid state lidar sensors, and radars integrated into the body and the roof-mounted “halo.” The autonomy package is powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computer. That halo also has integrated LED lights that will help riders identify their vehicle (similar to how Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs work).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, all of this extra tech is added to the Gravity as it’s being built at Lucid Motors’ Casa Grande, Arizona factory, saving the companies some time and money. By comparison, Waymo currently has to take apart the I-Pace SUVs it receives from Jaguar and integrate the autonomous tech as it puts them back together. (Future Waymo vehicles are planned to be more purpose-built.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080009\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg 3713w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sean O'Kane</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vehicle unveiled on Monday is a more polished-up version of the test version that the three companies have spent the last seven months showing off in press photos. The newest element revealed at CES has to do with how users will interface with the Uber-Lucid-Nuro robotaxi. That includes a small screen on the halo meant to greet riders and a ride interface inside the cabin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone who has ridden in a Waymo will find this UI experience familiar. The rear passenger screen shows an isometric graphical view of the robotaxi moving through city streets, with representations of nearby cars and pedestrians. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies did not have an interactive version of the software — which is being created by Uber — ready to test out just yet. But it has been built to show the standard information like estimated drop-off time, how much ride time is remaining, and climate and music controls. There are also buttons to reach rider support and to tell the robotaxi to pull over.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The front passenger screen shows a lot of the same information, just on a larger central touchscreen display. In the demonstration car on display at the Fontainebleau hotel, a lot of the same elements appeared on the Gravity’s sweeping 34-inch curved OLED display, which sits behind the steering wheel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber chose to build this forthcoming “premium” robotaxi service around the Gravity, and at a high level it seems like a wise decision. The Gravity is immensely spacious inside, especially in the two-row configuration on display at the hotel. (Uber says a three-row version will be available, too.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the Gravity’s first full year came with struggles. Lucid fought with software issues as it ramped up production of the SUV, and the problems got bad enough that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to owners in December apologizing for the “frustrations” they experienced. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid has seemingly been able to bounce back from that, and on Monday <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/lucid-motors-doubled-ev-output-in-2025-after-early-gravity-suv-struggles/\">announced</a> that it doubled its 2024 production figures and reached new sales records. Time will tell if the robotaxi version has any of the same kinds of software struggles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber, Lucid, and Nuro said Monday that once final validation is complete on the robotaxi later this year, true production versions will start rolling off Lucid’s factory lines in Arizona. The companies did not give a concrete timeline for that, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

GR00T relies on Cosmos Reason as its brain, and it unlocks whole-body control for humanoids so they can move and handle objects simultaneously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia also introduced Isaac Lab-Arena at CES, an open source simulation framework hosted on GitHub that serves as another component of the company’s physical AI platform, enabling safe virtual testing of robotic capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The platform promises to address a critical industry challenge: As robots learn increasingly complex tasks, from precise object handling to cable installation, validating these abilities in physical environments can be costly, slow, and risky. Isaac Lab-Arena tackles this by consolidating resources, task scenarios, training tools, and established benchmarks like Libero, RoboCasa, and RoboTwin, creating a unified standard where the industry previously lacked one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Supporting the ecosystem is Nvidia OSMO, an open source command center that serves as connective infrastructure that integrates the entire workflow from data generation through training across both desktop and cloud environments. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to help power it all, there’s the new Blackwell-powered Jetson T4000 graphics card, the newest member of the Thor family. Nvidia is pitching it as a cost-effective on-device compute upgrade that delivers 1200 teraflops of AI compute and 64 gigabytes of memory while running efficiently at 40 to 70 watts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia is also deepening its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-teams-up-with-hugging-face-to-offer-cloud-based-ai-training/\">partnership with Hugging Face</a> to let more people experiment with robot training without needing expensive hardware or specialized knowledge. The collaboration integrates Nvidia’s Isaac and GR00T technologies into Hugging Face’s LeRobot framework, connecting Nvidia’s 2 million robotics developers with Hugging Face’s 13 million AI builders. The developer platform’s open source <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/14/hugging-face-buys-a-humanoid-robotics-startup/\">Reachy 2</a> humanoid now works directly with Nvidia’s Jetson Thor chip, letting developers experiment with different AI models without being locked into proprietary systems.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger picture here is that Nvidia is trying to make robotics development more accessible, and it wants to be the underlying hardware and software vendor powering it, much like Android is the default for smartphone makers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are early signs that Nvidia’s strategy is working. Robotics is the fastest growing category on Hugging Face, with Nvidia’s models leading downloads. Meanwhile robotics companies, from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar to Franka Robots and NEURA Robotics, are already using Nvidia’s tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rubin systems will also be used in <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/blue-lion-vera-rubin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nersc.gov/what-we-do/computing-for-science/doudna-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the upcoming Doudna supercomputer</a> at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Named for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22576927/vera-rubin-dark-matter-astronomy-biography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin</a>, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink, systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Explaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/tensormesh-raises-4-5m-to-squeeze-more-inference-out-of-ai-server-loads/\">a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs</a>. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">between $3 trillion and $4 trillion</a> will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Boston Dynamics’ humanoid robot Atlas will be the first test case, according to Carolina Parada, senior director of robotics at Google DeepMind.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re looking to integrate our cutting-edge AI foundation models with Boston Dynamics’ new Atlas robots, and we’ll aim to develop the world’s most advanced robot foundation model to fulfill the promise of true general-purpose human needs,” Parada said onstage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up comes less than a year after the Google AI research lab announced new AI models called Gemini Robotics that are designed to allow robots to perceive, reason, use tools, and interact with humans. Gemini Robotics is based on a large-scale multimodal generative AI model, Gemini. At the time, Google DeepMind said the robotics AI model was trained to generalize behavior across a range of different robotics hardware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enter Boston Dynamics, and its majority owner, Hyundai Motor Group. While accelerating research will be a central piece of this partnership, this has real-world scaling intent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boston Dynamics already has products, like the quadruped Spot, that are in customers’ hands in more than 40 countries. Its warehouse robot Stretch has unloaded more than 20 million boxes globally since its launch in 2023, according to Hyundai. Now Boston Dynamics and Hyundai are preparing for the next generation, starting with the humanoid robot Atlas, which the company announced Monday is already in production and headed to the Hyundai factory in Savannah, Georgia</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A prototype of Atlas walked onstage during the press conference, showing off its ability to move. But as Alberto Rodriguez, director of Atlas behavior at Boston Dynamics, noted, making “Atlas into a product requires more than athletic performance for humanoids to really deliver on their promise. They have to be able to interact with people naturally.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rodriguez and his counterparts at Boston Dynamics believe that recent advancements in AI have created a clear path to get to those capabilities. That kind of natural interaction with humans has real safety implications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Atlas product, which was also revealed onstage Monday and will eventually head to Hyundai’s factory, has 56 degrees of freedom with rotation joints and human-scale hands that have tactile sensing. And it’s strong. The Atlas robot can lift up to 110 pounds and is designed to perform repetitive movements. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that kind of dexterity and strength, it will be critical for Atlas, or any humanoid robot, to safely interact and work with humans. Some of that has been handled on the hardware side; Atlas, for instance, has 360-degree cameras to allow it to see when people are approaching. But DeepMind’s work could help the robots learn how to act.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Rather than having a set of predefined, loaded tasks onto the robot, we think robots should understand the physical world the same way we do,”Parada said. “They should be able to learn from their experience. Should be able to generalize new situations and get better over time. So whether it is to assemble a new car part or to tie your shoelaces, robots should learn the same way we do from a handful of examples, and then get better very quickly with a little bit of practice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai, which plans to bring Atlas to its factory this year and eventually deploy them for tasks like parts sequencing by 2028, has also developed protocols to increase safety and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai said Monday it is opening a U.S. facility this year called a Robot Metaplant Application Center, or RMAC, that will teach robots how to map movements like lifts and turns. Training data from RMAC will be combined with real-world data collected via a software platform used in its Georgia factory to continually improve the robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to include more information about Atlas’ specs. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
