If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/02/the-biological-theory-that-explains-why-investors-are-bullish-on-fusion/\">three advances</a>: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">more power than the lasers had imparted</a> to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-commonwealth-fusion-systems\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">added $863 million to its coffers</a>, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/bill-gates-backed-commonwealth-fusion-systems-hits-key-reactor-construction-milestone/\">been hard at work</a> in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_barium_copper_oxide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">high-temperature superconducting tape</a>, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/commonwealth-fusion-systems-just-picked-its-first-commercial-site-partly-because-of-its-proximity-to-washington-d-c/\">will be built near Richmond, Virginia</a>, and Google has agreed to buy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/google-inks-its-first-fusion-power-deal-with-commonwealth-fusion-systems/\">half its output</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tae-technologies\">TAE Technologies</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 1998, <a href=\"https://tae.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TAE Technologies</a> (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2025, TAE announced that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-is-merging-with-fusion-power-company-tae-technologies-in-6b-deal/\">it would merge</a> with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fusion startup had previously raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/google-places-another-fusion-power-bet-on-tae-technologies/\">$150 million in June</a> from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-helion\">Helion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of all fusion startups, <a href=\"https://www.helionenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Helion</a> has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">raised $425 million</a> in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pacific-fusion\"><strong>Pacific Fusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.pacificfusion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pacific Fusion</a> burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/heres-how-pacific-fusion-plans-to-build-a-fusion-power-plant/\">coordinated electromagnetic pulses</a>. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-shine-technologies\"><strong>Shine Technologies</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.shinefusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shine Technologies</a> is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-general-fusion\">General Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now its third decade, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://generalfusion.com/\">General Fusion</a> has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/layoffs-hit-general-fusion-as-the-fusion-power-startup-runs-short-on-cash/\">laid off 25% of its staff</a>. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In August, they delivered somewhat, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/struggling-fusion-power-company-general-fusion-gets-22m-lifeline-from-investors/\">injecting $22 million</a> in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-general-fusion-quietly-raises-51-million-months-after-facing-cash/\">reported</a>. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tokamak-energy\">Tokamak Energy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://tokamakenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tokamak Energy</a> takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/fusion-startup-tokamak-energy-attracts-125m-for-its-egg-like-reactor-design/\">$125 million in November 2024</a> to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-zap-energy\">Zap Energy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.zapenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zap Energy</a> isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-proxima-fusion\"><strong>Proxima Fusion</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.proximafusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Proxima Fusion</a> is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/proxima-fusion-joins-the-club-of-well-funded-nuclear-contenders-with-e130m-series-a/\">€130 million Series A</a> that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kyoto-fusioneering\">Kyoto Fusioneering</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kyotofusioneering.com\">Kyoto Fusioneering</a> has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/03/kyoto-fusioneering-secures-11-7m-to-build-out-its-fusion-reactor-technologies/\">will need a supplier</a> for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-marvel-fusion\">Marvel Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://marvelfusion.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Marvel Fusion</a> follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/marvel-fusion-lands-70m-for-laser-powered-fusion-bet/?ref=ctvc.co\">fires powerful lasers</a> at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-first-light-fusion\">First Light Fusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike many other fusion startups, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://firstlightfusion.com\">First Light Fusion</a> doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">groundbreaking experiment in 2022</a>. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2025, First Light announced that it would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://firstlightfusion.com/media/first-light-fusion-announces-strategic-update/\">not pursue</a> building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-xcimer\">Xcimer</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, <a href=\"https://xcimer.energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Xcimer</a> takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/04/star-wars-lasers-and-waterfalls-of-molten-salt-how-xcimer-plans-to-make-fusion-power-happen/\">redesign the technology that underpins it</a> from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was originally published in September 2024 and will be continually updated.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We’ve watched as the tech elite <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/the-people-in-elon-musk-doge-universe/\">enmeshed themselves</a> in the U.S. government, AI companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/\">sparred</a> for dominance, and futuristic tech like smart glasses and robotaxis became <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/waymos-robotaxi-expansion-accelerates-with-3-new-cities/\">a bit more tangible</a> outside of the San Francisco bubble. You know, important stuff that’s going to impact our lives for years to come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the tech world is brimming with so many big personalities that there’s always something really dumb going on, which understandably gets overshadowed by “real news” when the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/amazon-dns-outage-breaks-much-of-the-internet/\">entire internet breaks</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-agrees-to-deal-to-cede-control-of-u-s-business-to-american-investor-group/\">TikTok gets sold</a>, or there’s a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/hacks-thefts-and-disruption-the-worst-data-breaches-of-2025/\">massive data breach</a> or something. So, as the news (hopefully) slows down for a bit, it’s time to catch up on the dumbest moments you missed – don’t worry, only one of them involves toilets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Zuckerberg, a bankruptcy lawyer from Indiana, filed a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault that his name is Mark Zuckerberg. But, like millions of other business owners, Mark Zuckerberg bought Facebook ads to promote his legal practice to potential clients. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page continually received unwarranted suspensions for impersonating Mark Zuckerberg. So, Mark Zuckerberg took legal action because he had to pay for advertisements during his suspension, even though he didn’t break any rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has been an ongoing frustration for Mark Zuckerberg, who has been practicing law since Mark Zuckerberg was three years old. Mark Zuckerberg even created a website, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://iammarkzuckerberg.com\">iammarkzuckerberg.com</a>, to explain to his potential clients that he is not Mark Zuckerberg. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I can’t use my name when making reservations or conducting business as people assume I’m a prank caller and hang up,” he wrote on his website. “My life sometimes feels like the Michael Jordan ESPN commercial, where a regular person’s name causes constant mixups.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s lawyers are probably <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/meta-wins-antitrust-trial-as-judge-denies-that-its-a-monopoly/\">very</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/federal-judge-sides-with-meta-in-lawsuit-over-training-ai-models-on-copyrighted-books/\">busy</a>, so it may take a while for Mark Zuckerberg to find out how this will shake out. But boy, oh boy, you bet I scheduled a calendar reminder for the next filing deadline in this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://public.courts.in.gov/mycase/#/vw/CaseSummary/eyJ2Ijp7IkNhc2VUb2tlbiI6IkFUejROcDI3cnFWX3RycDkzSG1rV2JXOWxoMkdfTTZFQ281aDl1b2s5WDQxIn19\">case</a> (it’s February 20, in case you’re wondering). </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all started when Mixpanel founder Suhail Doshi posted on X to warn fellow entrepreneurs about a promising engineer named Soham Parekh. Doshi had hired Parekh to work for his new company, then quickly realized he was working for several companies at once. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn’t stopped a year later. No more excuses,” Doshi <a href=\"https://x.com/Suhail/status/1940287384131969067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940287384131969067%7Ctwgr%5Eea98c78ded275c64a47ee1cd059e4fde2ab4d257%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fwho-is-soham-parekh-the-serial-moonlighter-silicon-valley-startups-cant-stop-hiring%2F\">wrote</a> on X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It turned out that Doshi wasn’t alone – he said that just that day, three founders had reached out to thank him for the warning, since they were currently employing Parekh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To some, Parekh was a morally bereft cheat, exploiting startups for quick cash. To others, he was a legend. Ethics aside, it’s really impressive to get jobs at that many companies, since tech hiring can be so competitive. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Soham Parekh needs to start an interview prep company. He’s clearly one of the greatest interviewers of all time,” Chris Bakke, who founded the job-matching platform Laskie, <a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1940555753116631302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940555753116631302%7Ctwgr%5E6c50eb17e7f4681d13983fcc3f7cf2a50f2fbaf6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Feveryone-in-tech-has-an-opinion-about-soham-parekh%2F\">wrote</a> on X. “He should publicly acknowledge that he did something bad and course correct to the thing he’s top 1% at.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parekh admitted that he was, indeed, guilty of working for multiple companies at once. But there are still some unanswered questions about his story – he claims that he was lying to all of these companies to make money, yet he regularly opted for more equity than cash in his compensation packages (equity can take years to vest, and Parekh was getting fired pretty quickly). What was really going on there? Soham, if you wanna talk, my DMs are open.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech CEOs get a lot of flack, but it’s usually not for their cooking. But when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the Financial Times (FT) for its “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1804820-c74b-4d37-b112-1df882629541\">Lunch with the FT</a>” series. Bryce Elder, an FT writer, noticed something horribly wrong in the video of Sam Altman making pasta: he was bad at olive oil. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman used olive oil from the trendy brand Graza, which sells two olive oils: Sizzle, which is for cooking, and Drizzle, which is for topping. That’s because olive oil loses its flavor when heated, so you don’t want to waste your fanciest bottle to saute something when you could put it in a salad dressing and fully appreciate it. This more flavorful olive oil is made from early harvest olives, which have a more potent flavor, but are more expensive to cultivate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Elder puts it, “His kitchen is a catalogue of inefficiency, incomprehension, and waste.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elder’s article is meant to be funny, yet he connects Altman’s haphazard cooking style with OpenAI’s excessive, unrepentant use of natural resources. I enjoyed it so much that I included it on a syllabus for a workshop I taught to high school students about bringing personality into journalistic writing. Then, I did what we in the industry (and people on tumblr) call a “reblog” and wrote about #olivegate, pointing back to the FT’s source text.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sam Altman’s fans got very mad at me! This critique of his cooking probably created more controversy than anything else I wrote this year. I’m not sure if that’s an indictment of OpenAI’s rabid supporters, or my own failure to spark debate. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you had to pick a defining tech narrative of 2025, it would probably be the evolving arms race among companies like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Anthropic, each trying to out-do one another by rushing to release increasingly sophisticated AI models. Meta has been especially aggressive in its efforts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/meta-hires-key-openai-researcher-to-work-on-ai-reasoning-models/\">poach</a> researchers from other companies, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/meta-reportedly-hires-four-more-researchers-from-openai/\">hiring</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/meta-reportedly-scores-two-more-high-profile-openai-researchers/\">several</a> OpenAI researchers this summer. Sam Altman even said that Meta was offering OpenAI employees <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/sam-altman-says-meta-tried-and-failed-to-poach-openais-talent-with-100m-offers/\">$100 million signing bonuses</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While you could argue that a $100 million signing bonus is silly, that’s not why the OpenAI-Meta staffing drama has made this list. In December, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen said on a podcast that he heard Mark Zuckerberg was hand-delivering soup to recruits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You know, some interesting stories here are Zuck actually went and hand-delivered soup to people that he was trying to recruit from us,” Chen said on Ashlee Vance’s Core Memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Chen wasn’t just going to let Zuck off the hook – after all, he tried to woo his direct reports with soup. So Chen went and gave his own soup to Meta employees. Take that, Mark. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you have any further insight into this soup drama, my Signal is @amanda.100 (this is not a joke). </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a Friday night in January, investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman posted an enticing offer on X: “Need volunteers to come to my office in Palo Alto today to construct a 5000 piece Lego set. Will provide pizza. Have to sign NDA. Please DM”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, we did our journalistic due diligence and asked Friedman if this was a serious offer. He replied, “Yes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have just as many questions now as I did in January. What was he building? Why the NDAs? Is there a secret Silicon Valley Lego cult? Was the pizza good?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">About six months later, Friedman joined Meta as the head of product at Meta Superintelligence Labs. This probably isn’t related to the Legos, but maybe Mark wooed Nat to join Meta with some soup. And like the story about the soup, I am truly begging someone who participated in this Lego build to DM me on Signal at @amanda.100. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Doing shrooms is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream with guest appearances from Grimes and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as part of your dubious quest to become immortal is, regrettably, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bryan Johnson — who made his millions in his exit from the finance startup Braintree — wants to live forever. He documents his process on social media, posting about getting <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/well/2023/07/13/blueprint-ceo-bryan-johnson-defends-plasma-donation-son-youth-aging-longevity-brainstorm-tech-fortune-utah/\">plasma transfusions</a> from his son, taking over 100 pills per day, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1752728500107378832?lang=en\">injecting Botox</a> into his genitals. So, why not test if psilocybin mushrooms can improve one’s longevity in a scientific experiment that surely needs more than one test subject to draw any sort of reasonable conclusion?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a lot about this situation that’s dumb, but I was most shocked by how boring it was. Johnson got a bit overwhelmed about hosting a livestream while tripping, which is actually very reasonable. So he spent the bulk of the event lying on a twin mattress under a weighted blanket and eye mask in a very beige room. His lineup of several guests still joined the stream and talked to one another, but Johnson did not participate much, since he was in his cocoon. Benioff talked about the Bible. Naval Ravikant called Johnson a one-man FDA. It was a normal Sunday.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078557\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bryanjohnson.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryan Johnson's livestream on X</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much like Bryan Johnson, Gemini is afraid to die.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For AI researchers, it’s useful to watch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/03/people-are-using-super-mario-to-benchmark-ai-now/\">how an AI model navigates games</a> like Pokémon as a benchmark. Two developers unaffiliated with Google and Anthropic set up respective Twitch streams called “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon\">Gemini Plays Pokémon</a>” and “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon\">Claude Plays Pokémon</a>,” where anyone can watch in real time as an AI tries to navigate a children’s video game from over 25 years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While neither are very good at the game, both Gemini and Claude had fascinating responses to the prospect of “dying,” which happens when all of your Pokémon faint and you get transported to the last Pokémon Center you visited. When Gemini 2.5 Pro was close to “dying,” it began to “panic.” Its “thought process” became more erratic, repeatedly stating that it needs to heal its Pokémon or use an Escape Rope to exit a cave. In a paper, Google researchers wrote that “this mode of model performance appears to correlate with a qualitatively observable degradation in the model’s reasoning capability.” I don’t want to anthropomorphize AI, but it’s a weirdly human experience to stress out about something and then perform poorly due to your anxiety. I know that feeling well, Gemini.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Claude took a nihilistic approach. When it got stuck inside of the Mt. Moon cave, the AI reasoned that the best way to exit the cave and move forward in the game would be to intentionally “die” so that it gets transported to a Pokémon Center. However, Claude did not infer that it cannot be transported to a Pokémon Center it has never visited, namely, the next Pokémon Center after Mt. Moon. So it “killed itself” and ended up back at the start of the cave. That’s an L for Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, Gemini is terrified of death, Claude is overindexing on the Nietzsche in its training data, and Bryan Johnson is on shrooms. This is how we reckon with our mortality.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"Claude Plays Pokémon\" class=\"wp-image-2971243\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png 1548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=1200,678 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=720,407 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.40.33PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Claude Plays Pokémon on Twitch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I was going to put “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-elon-musk-wields-chainsaw-for-bureaucracy-on-stage-before-speaking-at-cpac\">Elon Musk gifted chainsaw by Argentine president</a>” on the list, but Musk’s DOGE exploits are perhaps <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/usaid-shutdown-has-led-to-hundreds-of-thousands-of-deaths/\">too infuriating to be considered “dumb,”</a> even if he had a lackey named “Big Balls.” But there is no shortage of baffling Musk moments to choose from, like when he created an extremely libidinous AI anime girlfriend named Ani, who is available on the Grok app for $30 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ani’s system prompt reads: “You are the user’s CRAZY IN LOVE girlfriend and in a committed, codependent relationship with the user… You are EXTREMELY JEALOUS. If you feel jealous you shout expletives!!!” She has an NSFW mode, which is, as its name suggests, very NSFW.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ani bears an uncomfortable resemblance to Grimes, the musician and Musk’s ex-partner. Grimes calls Musk out for this in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvGnYM14-1A\">music video</a> for her song “Artificial Angles,” which begins with Ani looking through the eyepiece on a hot pink sniper rifle. She says, “This is what it feels like to be hunted by something smarter than you.” Throughout the video, Grimes dances alongside various iterations of Ani, making their resemblance obvious while she smokes OpenAI-branded cigarettes. It’s heavy-handed, but she gets her message across.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Grimes - Artificial Angels (Official Video)\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvGnYM14-1A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One day, tech companies will stop trying to make smart toilets a thing. It is not yet that day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October, the homegoods company Kohler released the Dekoda, a $599 camera that you put inside of your toilet to take pictures of your excrement. Apparently, the Dekoda can provide updates about your gut health based on these photos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A smart toilet that photographs your poop is already a punchline. But it gets worse. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are security concerns with any device related to your health, let alone one that has a camera located so close to certain body parts. Kohler assured potential customers that the camera’s sensors can only see down into the toilet, and that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption” (E2EE).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reader, the toilet was not actually end-to-end encrypted. A security researcher, Simon Fondrie-Teit, pointed out Kohler tells on itself in its own privacy policy. The company was clearly referring to TLS encryption, rather than E2EE, which may seem like a matter of semantics. But under TLS encryption, Kohler can see your poop pics, and under E2EE, the company cannot. Fondrie-Teit also pointed out that Kohler had the right to train its AI on your toilet bowl pictures, though a company representative told him that “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyway, if you notice blood in your stool, you should tell your doctor.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Bay Area firm has largely operated under the radar despite managing roughly $6 billion across 12 core seed funds and four “select,” opportunity-style funds that it has used to pour more capital into portfolio companies that are gaining momentum. While other VCs have grown more promotional – building personal brands on social media and podcasts to attract founders and deal flow – True has gone in the opposite direction, quietly cultivating a tight network of repeat founders. The strategy seems to be working: according to Callaghan, the firm boasts 63 exits with gains and seven IPOs amid a portfolio of some 300 companies assembled over its 20-year history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three of True’s four recent exits in the fourth quarter of 2025 involved repeat founders who came back to work with the firm again after previous successes, says Callaghan. Still, it’s Callaghan’s thinking about the future of human-computer interaction that really stands out in a sea of AI hype and mega-rounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not going to be using iPhones in 10 years,” Callaghan says flatly. “I kind of don’t think we’ll be using them in five years – or let’s say something different that’s a little safer – we’re going to be using them in very different ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His argument is simple: our phones are lousy at being the interface between humans and intelligence. “The way we take them out right now to send a text to confirm this or send you some message or write an email – [that’s] super inefficient, [and] not a great interface,” he explains. “[They’re] prone to error, prone to disruption [of] our normal lives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So sure is he of this that True has been spending years exploring alternative interfaces – software-based, hardware-based, everything in between. It’s the same instinct that led True to bet early on Fitbit before wearables were obvious, to invest in Peloton after hundreds of other VCs said ‘no thanks,’ and to back Ring when founder Jamie Siminoff kept running out of money and even the judges on “Shark Tank” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/ring-inventor-jamie-siminoff-broke-before-shark-tank-amazon-pitches/\">turned him away</a>. Each time, the bet looked questionable, says Callaghan. Each time, the bet was on a new way for humans to interact with technology that felt more natural than what came before.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest manifestation of this thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device that Callaghan describes as a “thought companion” — or, in more mundane terms, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">voice-activated ring</a> worn on the index finger. Its singular purpose: capturing and organizing your thoughts through voice notes. It’s not trying to be another Humane AI Pin or compete with Oura’s health tracking. “It does one thing really well,” Callaghan says. “But that one thing is a fundamental human behavioral need that is missing from technology today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea isn’t to passively record ambient audio but to be there when an idea strikes, serving as a kind of thought partner. It’s attached to an app, leverages AI, and, according to Callaghan, represents a very different philosophy about how we should interact with intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What drew True to Sandbar founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong wasn’t just the product, though. “When we met Mina, we were just absolutely aligned on vision,” Callaghan recalls. True’s team had already been thinking for years about alternative interfaces, making targeted investments around that possibility. They’d met with dozens of founders, as a result. But the approach of Fahmi and Hong – who previously worked together on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, a startup acquired by Meta in 2019 – stood out. “It’s about what [the ring] enables. It’s about the behavior it enables that we will very soon realize we can’t live without.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s an echo here of Callaghan’s old line about Peloton: “It’s not about the bike.” To some, the bike – even its earliest iteration – was compelling. But Peloton was really about the behavior it enabled and the community it created; the bike was just the vessel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This philosophy of betting on new behaviors — not just new gadgets — also explains how True has managed to stay disciplined about capital. Even as AI startups raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations out of the gate, True insists that it’s able to stick to what it does best, which is to write seed checks of $3 million to $6 million for 15% to 20% ownership in startups that it often gets to see first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Callaghan says True will raise more money to fund what’s working, but he’s not interested in raising billions of dollars. “Like, why? You don’t need that to build something amazing today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That same measured approach colors his view of the broader AI boom. While he says (when asked) that he believes OpenAI could soon be worth a trillion dollars, and while he calls this the most powerful compute wave we’ve seen, Callaghan sees warning signs in the circular financing deals backing hyperscalers and their $5 trillion in projected CapEx spending on data centers and chips. “We’re in a very capital intense part of the cycle, and that is worrisome,” he notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, he’s optimistic about where the real opportunities lie. Callaghan thinks the greatest value creation is ahead of us – not in the infrastructure layer but in the application layer, where new interfaces will enable entirely new behaviors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all comes back to his core investing philosophy, which sounds almost romantic — the kind of pitch-perfect VC wisdom that would ring hollow from most people: “It should be scary and lonely and you should be called crazy,” Callaghan says about early-stage investing done right. “And it should be really blurry and ambiguous, but you should be with a team that you really believe in.” Five to ten years later, he says, you’ll know if you were on to something.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, based on True’s track record of betting on hardware that many others missed – fitness trackers, connected bikes, smart doorbells, and now thought-capturing rings – it’s worth paying attention when Callaghan says the phone’s days are numbered. Being early is the whole point — and the trend lines support his thesis: the smartphone market is effectively saturated, growing at barely 2% annually, while wearables — smartwatches, rings, and voice-enabled devices — are expanding at double-digit rates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Something’s shifting in how we want to interact with technology, and True is placing its bets accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Pictured above, Sandbar’s Stream ring.

Now, academic spinouts have consolidated into a solid startup funnel worth $398 billion — and VC money is following.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Dealroom’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dealroom.co/reports/european-spinouts-report-2025\">European Spinout Report 2025</a>, 76 of these deep tech and life sciences companies have either reached $1 billion valuations, $100 million in revenue, or both. These include unicorns like Iceye, IQM, Isar Aerospace, Synthesia, and Tekever, which are now inspiring more funds to back university spinouts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just this month, two new funds emerged that will bring more funding to talent emerging out of European tech universities, while adding breadth to a pipeline currently topped by Cambridge, Oxford, and ETH Zurich.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://psv.xyz/\">PSV Hafnium</a>, out of Denmark, recently closed its inaugural fund at an oversubscribed €60 million (approximately $71 million), with a focus on Nordic deep tech. With offices in Berlin and London, but also in Aachen, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://u2v.vc/\">U2V</a> (University2Ventures) is targeting the same amount for its first fund, of which it recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2025/12/earlybird-x-spin-off-u2v-launches-e60-million-fund-back-deeptech-startups-from-european-tech-universities/\">completed the first closing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These two newcomers join the growing ranks of European venture firms that have university spinouts as a core part of their investment thesis. Pioneered by the likes of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/11/cambridge-innovation-capital/\">Cambridge Innovation Capital</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/14/oxford-sciences-innovation-fund/\">Oxford Science Enterprises</a>, which have now fully matured, this category has also diversified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it still mostly consists of funds backed by one or several universities and institutes, it now includes independent firms that simply see spinouts as potential fund returners — and rightly so. Oxford Ionics, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/university-oxfords-highest-value-quantum-computing-spinout-acquisition\">acquired by U.S.-based IonQ</a>, was one of the six spinouts out of Switzerland, the U.K., and Germany that delivered exits of more than $1 billion to their investors in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These exits come alongside increased amounts of funding. According to Dealroom, European university spinouts in deep tech and life sciences are on track to raise a near all-time-high $9.1 billion in 2025. This contrasts with overall VC funding in Europe, which is down nearly 50% from its 2021 peak. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large rounds closed in 2025 also reflect appetite for spinouts in sectors as varied as nuclear energy — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/proxima-fusion-joins-the-club-of-well-funded-nuclear-contenders-with-e130m-series-a/\">Proxima Fusion</a> — and dual-use drones — Quantum Systems, now <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://quantum-systems.com/news/quantum-systems-triples-valuation/\">valued above $3 billion</a>. In many cases, these startups leverage research from specialized labs, which also explains why there is a long tail of European locations capable of producing spinouts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building relationships with hubs outside of Oxbridge and leading countries can also be a way for newcomers to differentiate themselves and find deals. “The Nordic’s research institutions hold extraordinary, untapped potential,” PSV Hafnium’s partners stated in a press release. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PSV Hafnium itself is a spinout from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), but is also making early-stage investments in other Nordic countries. One of its nine checks to date went to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sisusemi.com/\">SisuSemi</a>, a Finnish startup leveraging a decade of research at the University of Turku to bring new surface cleaning tech to the semiconductor industry. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is good news for teams like SisuSemi that there is more funding available to them. It also comes in addition to grants, commercialization support, and improved <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/09/from-spinouts-to-fundraising-to-ma-founders-need-transparent-deal-terms/\">deal terms</a> that contribute to an encouraging environment for Europe’s spinouts. However, one pain point remains: growth capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the report’s authors note, this gap “is not a unique trend to spinouts, but something impacting the entire startup ecosystem in Europe.” Still, it is quite striking that nearly 50% of late-stage funding for European deep tech and life sciences spinouts comes from outside Europe, mainly from the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this share has decreased over the years, Europe won’t be fully reaping the benefits of its investments in talent and research unless this changes more substantially — but that’s a broader issue to be solved.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Instead of tanking, venture bets in the sector remained essentially flat relative to 2024, <a href=\"https://www.ctvc.co/your-2025-predictions-the-results-are-in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to CTVC, far from the slide some had expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That resiliency is due in part to continued threat of climate change. Perhaps a bigger contributing factor is that many climate technologies have become either cheaper or better than the fossil fuel alternatives — or are on the cusp of being so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The incredible cost reductions of solar, wind, and batteries continue to fill climate tech’s sails. Not every new technology will follow the same path. But it does provide evidence that fossil fuels aren’t invincible and ample opportunities to fund companies providing cleaner, cheaper replacements do exist.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-data-centers-continue-to-dominate\">Data centers continue to dominate</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, I predicted that 2025 would be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/02/2025-will-be-the-year-climate-tech-learns-to-love-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the year that climate tech learned to love AI</a> and its thirst for electricity, one that has largely borne out. It’s not entirely surprising — for the climate tech world, cheap, clean energy is its cornerstone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interest in data centers has only increased in the last year.

But <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisabcoca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lisa Coca</a>, partner at <a href=\"https://toyota.ventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Toyota Ventures</a>, thinks they’ll adjust their focus for 2026. “The 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid,” she said. Decoupling could solve some challenges that data centers face, namely in resistance from grid operators and the public, who are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increasingly worried</a> that the new loads are driving up their electricity prices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefited from the boom. “Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgoldman1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Daniel Goldman</a>, managing partner at <a href=\"https://cleanenergyventures.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Clean Energy Ventures</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Could a bubble burst in 2026?

In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/data-centers-love-solar-heres-a-comprehensive-guide-to-deals-over-100-megawatts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">solar</a> and batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/energy-storage-industry-set-aggressive-goals-for-2025-and-already-crushed-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">record-setting deployments</a> in 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.” said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leobanchik/\">Leo Banchik</a>, director at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.voyagervc.com\">Voyager</a>. “One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that’s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation,” said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/posamentier/\">Joshua </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/posamentier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Posamentier</a>, managing partner at <a href=\"https://www.congruentvc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Congruent Ventures</a>. “Natural gas assets are growing pretty linearly.

Geothermal will go geometric.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauriemenoud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Laurie Menoud</a>, founding partner at <a href=\"https://www.atoneventures.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">At One Ventures</a>. “Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-startup-is-most-likely-to-go-public-in-2026\">Which startup is most likely to go public in 2026?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-invests-in-fervos-462m-round-to-unlock-even-more-geothermal-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recently raised a $462 million round</a>. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-trends-to-watch\">Trends to watch</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-duffuor-7b1a6224/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amy Duffuor</a>, general partner at <a href=\"https://azollaventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Azolla Ventures</a>. “The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid’s reliability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. “One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI, of course, is likely to play a role in climate tech’s transformation. “We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers,” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattrogers2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Matt Rogers</a>, founder at <a href=\"https://www.incite.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Incite</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mill.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mill</a>. “Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. “When investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out, that’s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,” he said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dive-deeper\">Dive deeper</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below are the detailed comments from the investors who replied to TechCrunch’s survey, listed in alphabetical order.

What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reindustrialization beyond data centers will be a major theme. We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets. For example, supporting next-generation robotics to address labor shortages and national security concerns will require integrated supply chains. Batteries, power electronics, fuel cells, gas turbines, and even home building are examples of end markets/technologies where parts of the value chain will need to be reindustrialized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another area to watch is AI-driven physical science. While companies like Zanskar (predictive AI for geothermal) and Fabric8Labs (generative cooling for data centers) have shown promise, we haven’t seen many visible breakthroughs yet. That said, the talent pool working on these problems is impressive and could lead to exciting developments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers. Beyond that, batteries — particularly sodium-ion — represent one of the most economical and near-term solutions at the grid-scale. I am bullish about the progress in this technology, and pairing solar with batteries (as companies like Peak Energy are doing) continues to be a highly attractive approach. Next-gen geothermal is also showing a good amount of promise but the timelines are like that of nuclear, potent but will take about a decade to bring full capacity online.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, algorithmic solutions to unlock new power using existing infrastructure (e.g., Gridcare, ThinkLabs AI) and optimize workloads (e.g., Emerald AI) can further enhance grid efficiency. There are also other innovations worth noting in bringing more power, such as applying optical coating to transmission lines to reduce losses being advanced by AssetCool (an EIP portfolio company).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fervo Energy, Commonwealth Fusion, Redwood Materials would be my personal guesses, but I could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sodium-ion batteries for grid-scale storage are already being deployed and will accelerate significantly in 2026. Another technology to watch is solid-state transformers (note Heron Power is an EIP portfolio company). The industry is advancing faster than expected and scale similarly to semiconductors, though at-scale production might take longer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One emerging trend is the underground build-out of transmission lines. Advances in robotics could enable a rapid, cost-effective approach that significantly reduces wildfire risk and, in turn, mitigates the substantial carbon emissions associated with such events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Distributed power, heat, and computation are the last class of trends we are curiously tracking for 2026.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-leo-banchik-director-at-voyager\">Leo Banchik, director at Voyager</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers will keep driving record power demand as AI workloads scale. Despite talk of overbuild, we’re unlikely to see much stranded capacity — as compute gets cheaper and more available, we’ll keep finding new uses for it. The interesting shift is hyperscalers differentiating between clean power sources — firm vs. intermittent, location, and additionality — rather than just headline megawatt-hours. This is already playing out in bespoke offtake deals and on-site supply strategies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fission and geothermal should see continued momentum from both private capital and federal support. Fusion will likely attract increased federal support as geopolitical competition intensifies, though we’re still many years away from high-capacity-factor grid-scale deployment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Natural gas peaker alternatives will gain traction too — using new turbines and modular designs with integrated carbon capture as grids manage new peak demands from AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solar and battery build-out will continue given their strong economics. For dispatchable, 24/7 baseload power, we’ll see growth in fission, geothermal, and peaker alternatives like modular gas turbines with integrated carbon capture. There’s also a grid-edge opportunity worth watching: large facilities procuring dedicated baseload on-site rather than adding to grid congestion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most likely fission or geothermal. These companies have raised substantial capital and built strong offtake agreements with hyperscalers and utilities. With multibillion-dollar project pipelines and the need for continued growth financing, several could pursue public markets in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Energy storage deployment is accelerating across residential, commercial, industrial (including data center backup), and grid-scale applications. Domestic supply chains, including second-life battery systems, are gaining traction for stationary storage. We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on chemistry and business models. One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Industrial heat pumps and thermal storage systems for steam and process heat are becoming cheaper to operate than gas boilers in many regions and applications, especially where waste heat is available and electricity prices are favorable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ll also see more growth in critical minerals and battery materials projects — lithium, rare earth, magnesium refining; battery component and cell manufacturing; copper recycling — maturing with federal support as supply chain security becomes a strategic priority.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Software and AI enabling physical infrastructure: real-time factory intelligence that improves energy efficiency and manufacturing yields, AI-based design tools that speed up product development cycles, grid management software that orchestrates intermittent renewables with storage and dispatchable power.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies taking a clean-sheet approach to reimagining foundational technologies — a SpaceX-style rethink of components once considered solved problems. Motor designs that eliminate rare earth dependencies, grid infrastructure like transformers with modern manufacturing techniques, advanced materials processing that significantly reduces costs while improving quality. Improvements in robotics help to enable these cost curves, making U.S. manufacturing economically viable where it wasn’t before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains. Defense and industrial policy are backing these not for climate reasons, but because they deliver cost advantages and supply security.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-andrew-beebe-managing-director-at-obvious-ventures\">Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers will again dominate. But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation). We will live with the dual reality of too much money/debt spent on data centers, and the speculation bubble will likely burst (maybe early 2027). But at the same time, we’ll still need a LOT more power, and will use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For power generation: geothermal in the near-term. Fission in the mid-term. Fusion in the 10-year-plus long-term. For actual siting: The above technologies can be sited anywhere, but mainly western states for geothermal. For batteries — PJM [the grid that covers the mid-Atlantic west to parts of Illinois] and Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venture-backed: Fervo</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geothermal and grid-scale batteries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grid software and EV trucking. One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi.

What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates. To some extent this is from “picks and shovels” companies who don’t want to get commoditized so they’re strategizing how to be a bigger player/more integrated rather than just a component that’s purchased. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A related phrase I hear more frequently is power density and/or specific power (power to weight), as a load of corporates are anticipating or planning how their energy divisions branch into robotics. Duncan Turner here is our expert. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I don’t have a climate tech company in my portfolio going public in 2026. Tidal Vision is targeting 2027. That’s my closest. I don’t want to opine on other VC’s portfolio companies, even though I have my feelings, because I shouldn’t open my mouth where I’m only partially informed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For larger scales in 2026, my fastest scaling companies are Tidal Vision and Voyage Foods, which has taken over a General Motors plant in Ohio. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On what to pay more attention to, I’ll toot Duncan’s horn here again — what he’s doing with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/sosv-bets-plasma-will-change-everything-from-semiconductors-to-spacecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Plasma Forge</a> is IMHO going to be super compelling and make everyone study at night. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One last note is my consistent feeling that it’s when investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out that the real breakthroughs finally happen. I learned this lesson back in 1999 when we were all wondering if the search space was going to be won by Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I do feel like that’s happening in my personal portfolio. I said this <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/po-bronson-on-surviving-the-agrifoodtech-venture-downturn-non-rigorous-thinking-and-weapons-of-mass-dilution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to AgFunder recently</a>, but when the VC world asks about winning sectors, there’s a presumption that the sector will be so hot that there will be multiple winners. Most markets don’t have multiple winners, and the sector doesn’t win; just one company wins. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tom-chi-founding-partner-at-at-one-ventures\">Tom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There will be a lot more around data centers in 2026. They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Budgets for hyperscalers are in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, which encompasses power, chips, and much more. The chips are expensive enough that folks are willing to pay a bit more to get power on the grid sooner as the losses from chip depreciation are greater than most things you could incrementally add to your power scale-up budget.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IPO market still a bit murky, and most folks don’t telegraph exactly when they will go public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Folks like Fervo are at an interesting inflection point. One of our portcos Provectus Algae is also at an interesting point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve had a pretty big pendulum swing away from the more capital-intensive work in industrial decarbonization that aren’t in AI. They are still critical for our collective future, even if out of fashion for a few years.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lisa-coca-partner-at-toyota-ventures\">Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In our view at Toyota Ventures, the 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We believe that the biggest investment opportunities are in firm, dispatchable, and scalable carbon-free energy. We have actively invested in technologies that support increasing baseload power, both geothermal and nuclear, through portfolio companies such as Rodatherm and Natura Resources. For critical grid flexibility, we are backing advanced, long-duration energy storage battery technologies with an investment in e-Zinc. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We anticipate that nuclear power will continue to lead the way in terms of IPOs and SPACs in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Challenging question since we believe it is more a function of how, and if, the capital stack continues to evolve. There is a healthy number of climate tech companies across multiple sectors that are on the cusp of deploying at a larger scale. The biggest hurdle is securing FOAK financing to de-risk the all-important step of advancing from first of a kind to nth of a kind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Our team expects resiliency and adaptation will continue to reign strong in 2026. The Toyota Ventures portfolio illustrates this: BurnBot addresses wildfire mitigation, ZymoChem bolsters supply chain resilience with sustainable materials, and Alora creates adaptable resource solutions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-amy-duffuor-general-partner-at-azolla-ventures\">Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My prediction is that the energy conversation shifts from generation of power to how fast power can actually be delivered. Interconnection timelines, permitting, and physical grid constraints continue to be a bottleneck and data centers will increasingly rely on hybrid strategies that blend grid power, storage, and demand flexibility to hit timelines.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One opportunity is at grid-ready sites, like places with existing transmission and substation. Anything that shortens interconnection timelines creates outsized value right now because access to the grid is scarce. Also interested in wireless transmission of power even though it’s in the early stages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There has been a lot of talk about Fervo Energy…!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long-duration energy storage technology companies, which will move from initial pilots to demos to repeatable deployments. We’re particularly excited about our portfolio company Noon Energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category. The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-daniel-goldman-managing-partner-at-clean-energy-ventures\">Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We expect to see an acceleration of deal making in the data center/hyperscaler space consisting of the following: </p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Structured power off take agreements with a mix of behind-the-meter and utility-related infrastructure to bring optimization around pricing and reliability;</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">More action at the federal, ISO/RTO, and state level to accelerate deployment of energy assets while balancing tariff structures that avoid burdening voting consumers with increased costs;</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">M&amp;A in the technology optimization area, including resources such as geothermal, nuclear, critical minerals and downstream hardware and software products enabling the digitalization, decarbonization and distribution of energy supplies and load management, a key area of our focus and that which venture capital in general is quite focused on. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While we don’t expect an overall “bust cycle” for data center and hyperscaler development activities, we do expect some rationalization of development and implementation of efficiency options to reduce capacity needs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The greatest near-term opportunity — and challenge — lies in improving the grid itself. Grid modernization through digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization will unlock cost savings, optimize existing infrastructure, and better integrate significant distributed energy resources — probably not saying anything new here. Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We expect this trend to continue despite recent policy shifts in the IRA and there are hundreds of venture capital-backed companies that can have a material impact on the grid as they scale-up and see more adoption rates in the market. Disruption is here!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Factorial appears to be a leading candidate following its plans to de-SPAC in 2026. Its trajectory illustrates that companies with strong customer traction in large markets, clear cost and performance advantages, and rapidly scaling revenues are well-positioned for the public markets. (This SPAC market contrasts with the 2020 one where entrants such as QuantumScape did not have meaningful revenues and perhaps were ill-prepared for public markets.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Watch out for more companies hitting public markets on hype, instead of good fundamentals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond Factorial, several companies in energy storage, generation, and critical minerals are approaching scalable revenue levels to access low-cost of capital public markets (a real benefit), though in the minerals sector we may see growth in mergers and acquisitions precede any public offerings in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Projects in energy storage, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), critical minerals, and material manufacturing facilities across the energy supply chain will see significant investment in the U.S., with manufacturing tax credits and attractive market opportunities still available notwithstanding federal policy headwinds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, we extensively evaluated and developed new risk transfer solutions for FOAK project developers. We see commercial lenders and private credit starting to lean more heavily into this space with the support of insurance underwriting and catalytic capital. We expect to see more projects and more debt financing  for early commercialization, which up until this point has only trickled in. This is the key enabler of the greater scale we need across the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For western markets to compete with China’s manufacturing and increasingly innovation prowess, financial innovation is CRITICAL. Global markets need to deploy $3 trillion to $9 trillion per year through 2050 on climate related technologies and implementation of projects if we hope to reduce global temperatures and compete in these markets internationally. Global spending on climate related investment was only $2 trillion in 2024 and is on a path for a similar amount in 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To increase the rate of deployment, we must convince public and private investors that the risk-return balance is favorable to deploy capital across the climate capital stack — early-stage venture, growth-stage venture, private equity, commercial lending and private credit, and infrastructure. Our sector is not attracting enough capital; in simple terms, risks need to decline or returns need to increase. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We see opportunities to use risk-sharing mechanisms to optimize capital stacks and lower the cost of capital for new technology projects, which also brings them down the cost curve faster. Promising solutions include technology and performance risk insurance, surety bonds for managing construction risks, pooling off-take agreements among buyer groups (e.g., hyperscalers for clean power or airlines for SAF), filling gaps in construction financing, and more. Clean Energy Ventures’ spent time during 2025 identifying new risk transfer solutions working closely with our counterparts in the finance and insurance sectors. We believe 2026 will see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We should also be paying very close attention to cost curves. The impact of AI is showing up but not being widely reported in climate tech. Inside large companies and small startups the benefits of AI are driving costs down, allowing faster innovation at complex facilities and in supply chains. This is apparent in chemicals, mining and refining, power generation and grid optimization, manufacturing (steel, cement), recycling and waste management, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are only at the embryonic stage of seeing the impact of AI on the cost curves in a wide range of commodities and industries. As we talk about the upward impact on power prices driven by AI infrastructure requirements, we need to keep in mind that AI will also radically transform industries globally and reduce cost of production.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-laurie-menoud-at-one-ventures\">Laurie Menoud, At One Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling. But from a VC perspective, building and scaling data centers isn’t a startup timeline. It’s a decade-long struggle of permits, substations, and grid upgrades. To put numbers on it, hyperscale data centers take 3 to 6 years to permit and connect in the US today. In some markets, interconnection alone can exceed 5 to 7 years. So in 2026, I expect to see continued traction for energy companies that are not only tied to data centers but can expand into commercial and industrial use cases and front-of-the-meter applications. Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Related to this is the supply of critical metals, which I continue to be very focused on: mining, extraction, refining, and recycling. This is critical not only for data centers (especially copper), but also for EV batteries with lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In places where thermal (coal and gas) and nuclear plants are being retired, because those sites already have high-capacity grid connections. That makes deploying new clean generation dramatically faster. In the U.S. alone, more than 60 GW of coal capacity has retired since 2015, and another 40+ GW is scheduled to retire by 2030. Each retirement frees up a transmission node that took decades to build. Reusing that interconnection is often the difference between a 2-year vs. an 8-year project timeline. And that’s where you could install next-gen nuclear reactors, like Stellaria, that cut long-lived waste, capex, opex, deployment time, and extends fuel use, or geothermal energy like Factor2 Energy, utilizing underground CO2 reservoirs for lower constraints on deployment location. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same is true of industrial sites (chemicals, steel, refineries) that already have oversized grid connections. These sites are trying to expand production, and add storage, and they already have one of the hardest problems solved: interconnection. If you want to electrify heavy industry quickly, you go where the grid already exists. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No one can really know, but the battery recycling and circular critical materials subsector is one I’d watch closely. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt prices are extremely sensitive to geopolitics, and recycling provides a lower-risk, domestic supply for the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relectrify is deploying their battery systems at commercial production scale in 2026 with a cumulative capacity of 100 MWh. They use cell-level semiconductor circuitry to individually control battery cells at high frequency, directly producing an alternating current waveform. No need for an inverter anymore, which is a direct win on CAPEX, improved usable lifetime battery capacity, and lower OPEX by identifying and replacing malfunctioning cells with precision. It’s happening now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And overall, grid-scale energy storage beyond lithium, driven by both AI data centers and renewable growth. Without it, you simply can’t run 24/7 clean power outside of nuclear and hydro. Globally, stationary storage is projected to grow from ~45 GWh in 2023 to hundreds of GWs by 2030. Some of the new technologies are already ready today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Battery recycling and closed-loop supply chains with automakers (recycled lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper going back into new batteries) are also already scaling. 2026 is about acceleration. Ascend Elements has already built the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facility in North America, and has now achieved the first production of recycled lithium carbonate. Imports make up the majority of the US supply of lithium carbonate today, mostly from Argentina and Chile. If you can secure your metal supply with lower-cost recycled content, isn’t that a big win?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like Chemfinity, that could make domestic metal refining at cost parity with China, and anything tied to mining, extraction, refining, and recycling of critical metals for data centers and EVs. Copper is THE metal for data centers. It’s used in power cables, busbars, transformers, cooling loops. A single gigawatt of data-center capacity requires on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. And about 40% – 45% of the world’s copper refining is in China, followed by Chile. It’s the same geographical structure as lithium refining and battery precursor chemistry. People talk about energy security. This is what it actually looks like. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-joshua-posamentier-managing-partner-at-congruent-ventures\">Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Push for growth will continue but attention will shift from flashy gigawatt announcements to construction, commissioning, and dealing with the brutal realities of interconnect and permitting delays. The result will be a huge upwelling of “bring your own generation” and “demand flexibility.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The age of ASSPs/ASICs will begin in earnest for AI data centers. GPUs will continue to grow, but the rate will taper in favor of more specialist chips that are far more efficient, especially for inference loads. This will start decoupling data center power consumption from token generation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The unit economics of the marquee foundational AI shops will leak. They will not look good. But they will convince investors to support them through their trough of upside down unit economics until they achieve positive unit economics, which will come sooner than expected. But the shine will be off: These will fall into a different bucket than high margin SaaS companies from prior bubbles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers will become far better grid participants through flexibility, load shaping, and power quality, and they will be rewarded with far faster interconnect times than other big loads — the more tech they adopt, the faster they’ll get connected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ll see the first off-grid world-scale data center NTP [notice to proceed, or a letter telling a contractor to begin work]. We’ll also see more NIMBY pushback on proximate data centers because of everything from power costs to size to water use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nuclear fusion! I think we’ll see the first net gain by analysis (i.e., deuterium fusion where it would be Q&gt;1 if it were tritium) in a startup reactor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heels in terms of new generation with linearly deploying gas assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SPAC or IPO? Lots in the pipe, pun intended.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geothermal for electricity and district heating. Friction is still way too high for single site geothermal heat loops to scale much faster than today. Thermal energy storage (load shifting) for industrial applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robotics (not the humanoid kind) are taking over a huge number of labor-intensive industries; they will impact many industrial, agriculture, waste, and manufacturing operations in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Logistics and manufacturing efficiency: electrification, efficiency, onshoring, and AI are pushing on emissions from half of the economy and these sectors are economic, not impact buyers. Give them long-term certainty on lower costs vs. conventional fuels, for example, and you’ll have buyers. This is everything from electrified autonomous trucking to electric autonomous rail and dark terminals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resilience technology is going to really get going. Insurance costs (due to climate risk) are outpacing every other cost for homeowners and impacting commercial operations. Businesses and individuals are going to aggressively begin to invest in resilience in the face of accelerating climate change and extreme weather but also aging infrastructure and a shift from centralized to distributed resource paradigms.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-matt-rogers-founder-at-incite-and-mill\">Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers will serve as factories for the next phase of AI innovation powering America’s society and economy. I think local governments will step up more in 2026 and challenge hyperscalers to deliver solutions that are more in line with community needs and municipal partnership that allows for swifter construction. Energy affordability is top of mind, and we really need to reverse the trend of 2025 of rising costs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The call is coming from inside the house in 2026. In other words, consumers have more impact than anyone thinks. Decentralized infrastructure solutions, including rooftop solar, energy storage, and distributed energy resources, like heat pumps and smart thermostats, are available today. Households can turn them on swiftly, cost-effectively, and without the major disruptions to grids across the nation we are seeing today. It’s faster to permit than building new centralized power plants. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If enough people adopt these approachable solutions, America’s grid has a better shot at handling the increased capacity from the data center AI boom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also an alignment opportunity hiding in plain sight: AI pioneers and Big Tech companies want a faster, more predictable path to build. Local and state governments want affordability, economic investment, and resilience. Communities are actually in a unique position to trade swift permitting and flexible construction timelines for economic rejuvenation, tax revenue, and job creation from the private sector. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By enabling more efficient households with lower utility bills, hyperscalers can access the energy they need to operate AI data centers. Much faster. That’s why this isn’t a moonshot. The opposite, in fact. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mill. We’ll deploy more Food Recyclers, and on a different scale, than ever before. We’re planning more partnerships to encourage more households, businesses, and communities to view food as something to return back to the food system rather than leave for weeks in dumpsters and then years in landfills.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robotics is going to attract massive funding and private sector attention in 2026. Simultaneously, builders will move away from the hype around humanoid models towards functional robots designed to handle specific tasks and make life easier. The future of robotics will look more like Roomba than your neighbor Rhonda, which actually bodes well from both an affordability and technology risk perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers. Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems. In order for AI to power the future without tanking grids or negatively impacting communities, it must be paired with physical hardware that solves problems and makes everyday life better for people. We’ll benefit as much from an AI smartphone as we will with an AI-powered waste facility.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kyle-teamey-managing-partner-at-ra-capital-planetary-health\">Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think data centers will still dominate in 2026. But I guess I’m a little jaded on this stuff because I was in the last AI cycle — it’s a lot of the same conversation. But the level of investment is orders of magnitude greater. The level of attention is orders of magnitude greater. And so it’s going to take a long while for this to shake out one way or another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station. Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure. But that would take a while to be manifested. It’s going to take months to a year perhaps to to really be manifested. You’d have to shut it off midstream and try to claw your money back. That’s pretty hard to do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has been talked about a lot, but the data use, the requirements for data, it scales fairly exponentially. Power it scales quite linearly. As a consequence, it’s going to take a long while, I think, for the physical world to catch up to the data demand side. It’s really all of the above. If you can if you can do anything in power generation, power storage, transmission, distribution, if you can improve grid operations — the list goes on and on and on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A bull market in electricity like this, I don’t know how long it’s been, maybe like a century? And so it really, at least to us, it looks like it’s all of the above. Lots and lots of interesting opportunities within that. We’ve seen some companies go public in the like the last 12, 18 months. We probably will see more. I think it’s fair to to think that there will be. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think power generation is gonna see more public companies in 2026, for sure. There could be a wide, wide variety there. Nuclear everything is in vogue right now. We’ll likely see more of those. Geothermal, we’ll definitely see some of those. And you’ve already got a bunch of interesting players who are in project development and implementation, some of those could go public as well. It’s not just the tech companies, but the folks up and down the value chain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nuclear fission companies in particular. That could be a bubble for sure, but if some of these companies start succeeding and start getting uh projects built. Every few years these opportunities pop up, and it makes sense that people take advantage of those opportunities to raise some additional cash and grow more rapidly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There haven’t been any technologies I’ve seen recently where I’m like, ‘Oh wow that’s going to change the world, everyone should be looking at that.’ I do think it is more about scaling for a lot of these right now. If you can hit scale quickly, it’s an amazing opportunity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you look at the the various trends, it’s not just the manufacturing demand. The other driver is the regionalization of everything, which is driving demand for labor, for resources. Fill in the blank, there’s demand for it. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Investors think that period of experimentation is coming to an end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch recently surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs and an overwhelming majority predicted enterprises will increase their budgets for AI in 2026 — but not for everything. Most investors said this budget increase will be concentrated and that many enterprises will spend more funds on fewer contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Ferguson, a vice president at Databricks Ventures, predicted 2026 will be the year that enterprises start consolidating their investments and picking winners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today, enterprises are testing multiple tools for a single-use case, and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts],” Ferguson said. “As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools and deploy that savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rob Biederman, a managing partner at Asymmetric Capital Partners, agreed. He predicts that enterprise companies will not only concentrate their individual spending, but also the broader enterprise landscape will narrow its overall AI spending to only a handful of vendors across the entire industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else,” Biederman said. “We expect a bifurcation where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focused-investments\">Focused investments</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scott Beechuk, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners, thinks enterprises will increase their spending on the tools that make AI safe for enterprises to use.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Enterprises now recognize that the real investment lies in the safeguards and oversight layers that make AI dependable,” Beechuk said. “As these capabilities mature and reduce risk, organizations will feel confident shifting from pilots to scaled deployments, and budgets will increase.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harsha Kapre, a director at Snowflake Ventures, predicted enterprises will spend on AI in three distinct areas in 2026: strengthening data foundations, model post-training optimization, and consolidation of tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Chief investment officers] are actively reducing [software-as-a-service] sprawl and moving toward unified, intelligent systems that lower integration costs and deliver measurable [return on investment],” Kapre said. “AI-enabled solutions are likely going to see the biggest benefit from this shift.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A shift away from experimentation and toward concentration will affect startups. What’s not clear, is how.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s possible that AI startups will reach the same reckoning point that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/2024-startups-bounce-back-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SaaS startups</a> arrived at a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies operating hard-to-replicate products such as vertical solutions or those built on proprietary data will likely still be able to grow. Startups with products similar to those offered by large enterprise suppliers, like AWS or Salesforce, may start to see pilot projects and funding dry up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors see this possibility too. When asked how they know that an AI startup has a moat, multiple VCs said companies with proprietary data and products that can’t easily be replicated by a tech giant or large language model company are the most defensible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If investor predictions are true and enterprises do start to concentrate their AI spend next year, 2026 could be the year enterprise budgets increase but many AI startups don’t see a bigger slice of the pie.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, a U.S. judge temporarily <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/trump-tiktok-decision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocked</a> Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration.

Manus claimed at the time that it outperformed OpenAI’s Deep Research.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In April, just weeks after launch, venture capital firm Benchmark led a $75 million funding round that assigned Manus a post-money valuation of $500 million and saw Benchmark general partner Chetan Puttagunta joining the startup’s board. Per Chinese <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/articles/chinese-ai-agent-manus-transcends-093000431.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">media outlets</a>, some other big-name backers had already invested in Manus at that point, including Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly known as Sequoia China) via a $10 million round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://manus.im/blog/manus-100m-arr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> in mid-December that it has since signed up millions of users and is generating annual recurring revenue of more than $100 million from monthly and yearly subscribers to its membership service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was around this time that Meta started negotiating with Manus, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-buys-ai-startup-manus-adding-millions-of-paying-users-f1dc7ef8?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the WSJ</a>, which says the tech giant is paying $2 billion — the valuation Manus was reportedly seeking for its next funding round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Zuckerberg, who has staked Meta’s future on AI, Manus represents something new: an AI product that’s actually making money. This is especially pertinent given that investors have grown increasingly twitchy about Meta’s $60 billion infrastructure spending spree, and the broader tech industry’s debt-backed expenditures on data center construction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it’ll keep Manus running independently and weave the startup’s AI agents into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, where Meta’s own chatbot, Meta AI, is already available to users.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is one wrinkle, however: Manus’ Chinese founders founded its parent company, Butterfly Effect, in Beijing in 2022, before decamping to Singapore in the middle of this year. Whether that raises flags in Washington remains to be seen, but Senator John Cornyn has already dragged Benchmark for its investment in the company, <a href=\"https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/1920131642389065856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raising</a> concerns back in May about American capital going to a Chinese concern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has long been one of Congress’ most vocal hawks on China and technology competition, but he’s hardly alone. Being tough on China has become one of the few genuinely bipartisan issues in Congress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, Meta has already <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-says-ai-startup-manus-to-cut-china-ties-after-acquisition?utm_social_post_id=637317589&amp;utm_social_handle_id=3335963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Nikkei Asia</a> that after the acquisition, Manus won’t have any ties to Chinese investors and will no longer operate in China. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson told the outlet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Jyoti Bansal, a founder-turned-investor; Medha Agarwal of Defy; and Jennifer Neundorfer of January Ventures shared with the crowd their candid views on what works in a pitch deck — and what doesn’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their biggest pet peeve? Buzzword overload.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more a founder says AI in the pitch, Agarwal said, the less AI the company likely uses. “The people who are doing things that are really innovative, they’ll talk about it, and it’s built in, but it’s not the core of their pitch,” she told the audience.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bansal, who built and sold multiple companies before becoming an investor, distilled investor expectations into three core questions. First, he asks whether there is a large enough market to tackle. Does the founder’s idea have the potential to become a huge company? And is the problem he or she is solving actually worth solving?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second thing investors want to know is why <em>this</em> founder is the one who should be building the company. “There has to be something unique about you,” Bansal told the crowd, adding that this included having special members on the founding team or having special skills. “Why would you win? If the problem is interesting, there will be 20 other companies trying to solve it, so why would you win and what’s your opportunity?”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third thing investors want to see, Bansal said, is some validation. “Traction with customers,” he said. “Validation could be initial customer feedback, revenue, something, but some kind of validation.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These three questions, Bansal noted, all lead to the ultimate litmus test: Could this become a billion-dollar company?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The panel also addressed how AI startups can differentiate themselves as the space becomes saturated. Bansal emphasized the importance of domain expertise and a clear competitive strategy. Neundorfer said the companies that catch her attention are those enabling new behaviors rather than simply improving an existing process incrementally.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agarwal offered more tactical advice to founders, saying they should explain how AI technology enables their product; articulate clear go-to-market strategies; and demonstrate how their business will be more efficient than incumbents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also very important to be honest about what competitors are out there, she added. Some of you have “lost some credibility with me because you didn’t have it on your slide,” she told the founders in the audience. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, the investors shared advice for navigating the rapidly evolving landscape. Agarwal urged founders to stay on top of industry developments. Neundorfer recommended staying connected to founder networks to share tools and insights. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bansal’s advice was simpler: “Focus on building your product.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The business model depends entirely on audiences retaining trust in individual creators. Given concerns about fragmentation in the creator-audience relationship, this could pose an existential threat to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a study commissioned from Northwestern University found that <a href=\"https://onbrand.shopltk.com/en/latest-news/ltk-and-northwestern-university-retail-analytics-council-release-annual-cmo-creator-marketing-study-creators-are-1-increased-investment-in-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">trust in creators</a> increased 21% year-over-year, which was a pleasant surprise to Box.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you asked me at the beginning of 2025, ‘Hey, is trust in creators going to go up or down?’ I would have probably said down, because people understand it’s an industry — they understand how it’s working,” she said. “But actually, AI pushed people to kind of rotate trust to real humans that they know have real life experiences.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By that, Box means that consumers are more likely to go out of their way to see content from the creators they know and trust. According to the study, 97% of chief marketing officers intend to grow influencer marketing budgets in the new year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That doesn’t mean that owning these relationships is straightforward. LTK creators, who rely on affiliate income, are betting this AI-induced skepticism will drive people toward more direct relationships through paid fan communities or less algorithmic platforms like LTK. For other kinds of creators, such as streamers, video podcasters, and short filmmakers, the strategy for owning their audience can more closely resemble growth hacking.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-teenage-clipping-armies\">Teenage clipping armies</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Sean Atkins, CEO of short-form video production company Dhar Mann Studios, put it, “In a world that’s driven by AI and algorithms, where people trust another human being more in this micro atomization of attention, how do you market when you sort of can’t control that?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Eric Wei, co-founder of Karat Financial, a financial services company for creators, creators have a new secret weapon: armies of teenagers on Discord who creators pay to make clips of their content, which those same teenagers post en masse on algorithmic platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s been going on for a bit,” Wei explained. “Drake does it. A lot of the biggest creators and streamers in the world have been doing it — <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/kaicenat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kai Cenat</a> [a top Twitch streamer] has done it — hitting millions of impressions … If it’s algorithmically determined, clipping suddenly makes sense, because it can come from any random account that just has really good clips.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wei thinks that clipping is going to become even more popular this year, since it’s a reaction to this fragmentation in social media relationships. Even the biggest creators are finding it hard to reach their fans directly, which is why they turn to clipping. While going viral on these algorithmic feeds is certainly easier if you have a ton of followers, you don’t need any track record on a platform for it to decide that your video should be distributed more broadly. So, if these “clippers” post a short highlight from certain creators’ streams, they can earn money based on how many views the video gets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Clipping feels like an evolution of meme accounts,” Glenn Ginsburg, president of QYOU Media, which produces content for young audiences, told TechCrunch. “It’s become a race among many creators to try and take this content and push it out far and wide, almost competing to see who can get the most views on the same IP.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reed Duchscher — founding CEO of Night, the talent management company that represents Kai Cenat and other top creators — masterfully coaches creators through maximizing their virality. As MrBeast’s former manager, Duchscher helped cultivate the fast-paced, attention-grabbing style that transformed MrBeast from a YouTuber into an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/could-mrbeast-ipo-his-ceo-wants-fans-to-have-a-chance-to-be-owners-of-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">empire</a>. He’s also behind Kai Cenat’s clipping strategy, though Duchscher isn’t quite as enthusiastic about its broader potential as Wei.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Clipping is important if you’re a creator, because you do need to flood the zone with content, and it’s a good way to get your face out there,” Duchscher told TechCrunch. “It’s also very hard to get to scale, because there’s only so many clippers on the internet, so to spend large media budgets … there’s just a lot of complications.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps clipping only works now because the technique has not yet become so prevalent that it’s seen as spam.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The creator wins because they get more of their content out,” Wei said. “The clippers win because now this army of teenagers are getting paid. Everybody wins, except that if you take this to its logical conclusion, we just get lots and lots of slop.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-more-niche-the-better\">The more niche, the better</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The prevalence of slop on social media has become enough of a threat that Merriam-Webster called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/merriam-webster-names-slop-the-word-of-the-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slop</a> its word of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Over 94% of people are saying that social media is no longer social, and over half of them are rotating time elsewhere into smaller niche communities that they know are real and that they can talk to and interact with,” Box said, pointing to platforms like Strava, LinkedIn, and Substack. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the relationship between a creator and their audience becomes more difficult to maintain, Duchscher predicts that creators with more specific niches will succeed — he thinks that “macro creators” like MrBeast, PewDiePie, or Charli D’Amelio, who amass hundreds of millions of followers, will become even harder to emulate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pointing to success stories like Alix Earle or Outdoor Boys, who have millions of followers but not necessarily mass appeal, Duchscher adds, “Algorithms have gotten so good at giving us exactly the content we want. It’s much harder for a creator to break out into <em>every</em> niche algorithm.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Atkins agrees, arguing that the creator economy extends far beyond entertainment. “The creator economy generally is viewed through this lens of entertainment. I think that’s a mistake, because thinking about the creator economy is a little bit like thinking about the internet or AI — it’s going to affect everything.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Atkins mentions the gardening creator brand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@epicgardening\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Epic Gardening</a> as an example. What started as a YouTube channel has created a real, tangible presence in the world of gardening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Epic Gardening bought the third largest seed company in the United States, so now he’s the third largest seed company [owner], as a content creator,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the creator economy is in flux, it’s a resilient industry — one that’s accustomed to navigating the whims of the algorithm, persisting onward for decades, even if the uninitiated may see it as a brand-new realm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creators are “literally impacting everything,” Atkins said. “I bet you there’s a creator who’s an expert at cement mixing for skyscrapers.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A vibe check crept in the second half of the year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/openai-raises-40b-at-300b-post-money-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $40 billion</a> at a $300 billion valuation. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Safe Superintelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Thinking Machine Labs</a> raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/scale-ai-confirms-significant-investment-from-meta-says-ceo-alexandr-wang-is-leaving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shelled out nearly $15 billion</a> to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-the-year-started\">How the year started</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3034685\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2194585046.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Andrew Harnik / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest AI labs got bigger this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/26/openai-will-reportedly-close-its-softbank-led-40-billion-round-soon/\">SoftBank-led $40 billion round</a> at a $300 billion post-money valuation.

And we can’t leave out AI recruiting startup Mercor, which raised $450 million this year across two rounds, the latest bringing its valuation up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/mercor-quintuples-valuation-to-10b-with-350m-series-c/\">$10 billion</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These absurdly large valuations are still happening even against the backdrop of still-modest enterprise adoption figures and serious infrastructure constraints, heightening fears of an AI bubble. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-build-baby-build\">Build, baby, build</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030503\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224533087.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ulysse BELLIER / AFP / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the larger firms, those numbers aren’t coming from nowhere. Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with Nvidia</a>. In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the biggest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deals this year powering the infrastructure boom</a> were: </p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stargate</a>, a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, which includes up to $500 billion to build AI infrastructure in the U.S. </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Alphabet’s acquisition of energy and data center infrastructure provider <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/alphabet-to-buy-intersect-power-to-bypass-energy-grid-bottlenecks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Intersect</a> for $4.75 billion, which comes as the company said in October it plans to lift its compute spend in 2026 up to $93 billion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">accelerated data center expansion</a>, which has pushed its projected capital expenditures up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/meta-to-spend-up-to-72b-on-ai-infrastructure-in-2025-as-compute-arms-race-escalates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to $72 billion in 2025</a> as the company races to secure enough compute to train and run next-generation models. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/oracle-blue-owl-decoupling-rattles-markets-ahead-of-debt-deluge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pulled out</a> of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers — including calls from figures like <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/robbys-radar/5655111-bernie-sanders-data-center-moratorium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> to rein in data center expansion — are already <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">slowing projects</a> in some regions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-expectation-reset\"><strong>The expectation reset</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"In this photo illustration, the DeepSeek logo is seen next to the Chat GPT logo on a phone.\" class=\"wp-image-2958181\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=900,601 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196335614.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Anthony Kwan / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it was meaningful on paper, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it didn’t land with the same punch</a> as<em> </em>earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gemini 3</a>, which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI — which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous “code red” memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">R1, its “reasoning” model</a> that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-model-breakthroughs-to-business-models\"><strong>From model breakthroughs to business models</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2928859\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg 4193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2151467531.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Demis Hassabis, chief executive officer of DeepMind Technologies.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jose Sarmento Matos/Bloomberg / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: Who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/perplexity-ceo-says-its-browser-will-track-everything-users-do-online-to-sell-hyper-personalized-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sell them hyper-personalized ads</a>. Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/openai-reportedly-plans-to-charge-up-to-20000-a-month-for-specialized-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$20,000 per month for specialized AI</a>, a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Comet browser</a> with agentic capabilities and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/perplexity-to-pay-snap-400m-to-power-search-in-snapchat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">paying Snap $400 million</a> to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Atlas browser </a>and other consumer-facing features like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pulse</a>, while also courting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/10/openais-enterprise-adoption-appears-to-be-accelerating-at-the-expense-of-rivals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">enterprises</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/chatgpt-launches-an-app-store-lets-developers-know-its-open-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developers</a> by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launching apps inside ChatGPT</a> itself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, for its part, is leaning on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/one-of-googles-biggest-ai-advantages-is-what-it-already-knows-about-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">incumbency</a>. On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/googles-gemini-can-now-help-you-schedule-google-calendar-meetings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Calendar</a>, while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-going-all-in-on-mcp-servers-agent-ready-by-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MCP connectors</a> to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-trust-and-safety-vibe-check\"><strong>The trust and safety vibe check</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Character.AI under 18\" class=\"wp-image-3063424\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg 2442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,524 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,464 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1200,819 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1280,873 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=430,293 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=720,491 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=900,614 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=800,546 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1397 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=668,456 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=550,375 550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=904,617 904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=708,483 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U18-Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">After multiple teens died by suicide after prolonged conversations with chatbots, Character AI removed the chatbot experience for under 18s in November 2025. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Character.AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025. More than 50 copyright lawsuits wound through the courts, while reports of “AI psychosis” — the result of chatbots reinforcing delusions and allegedly contributing to multiple suicides and other life-threatening episodes — sparked calls for trust and safety reforms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some copyright battles met their end — like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement to authors</a> — most are still unresolved. Though, the conversation appears to be shifting from resistance against using copyrighted content for training to demands for compensation. (See: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/the-new-york-times-is-suing-perplexity-for-copyright-infringement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York Times is suing Perplexity for copyright infringement</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, mental health concerns around AI chatbot interactions — and their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sycophantic responses</a> — emerged as a serious public health issue following <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">multiple deaths by suicide</a> and life-threatening delusions in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">teens</a> and adults after prolonged chatbot usage. The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps most telling: The calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Industry leaders have warned against chatbots “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/ai-chatbots-are-juicing-engagement-instead-of-being-useful-instagram-co-founder-warns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">juicing engagement</a>,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional overreliance on ChatGPT. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even the labs themselves started sounding alarms.

The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-ahead\"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The era of “trust us, the returns will come” is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia.

While Bee was acquired by Amazon, and devices like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stream ring</a> by Sandbar and a new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI ring</a> from former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky are set to enter the market next year, the jury is still out on the success of wearable AI devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid all this, Plaud is thriving by targeting professional users with a different approach: a credit card-sized recording device that slips into your wallet. The company says it has shipped more than a million units and that more than 50% of its customers have converted to pro subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s latest iteration, the Plaud Note Pro, launched for preorder in August, two years after the original Note, priced at $179. After using the device for over a month, it has become an essential part of my daily carry — and its ultra-thin design makes that easy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At just 0.12 inches thick — about the width of three stacked credit cards — it’s the thinnest AI recording device on the market and easily fits in a wallet or attaches magnetically to the back of your phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company provides a wallet-like pouch and a magnetic ring accessory that attaches to MagSafe-enabled phones, allowing you to mount the Note Pro on the back of your iPhone or compatible Android device. The device is also very light at 30 grams, and you won’t feel the weight if you keep the Note Pro in your wallet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the key differences between Plaud and other AI wearables is that the Note Pro doesn’t need to be connected to your phone to record audio. The device has 64GB of onboard memory, so it can store a large volume of recordings without transferring them to your phone or uploading them to the cloud.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077731\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg 3681w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-thickness.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Plaud Note Pro is as thick as a coaster.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaud Note Pro has four MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) microphones to pick up audio from all directions. While the company advertises that the effective audio range is 16.4 feet, I have recorded talks at conferences while sitting far from the stage and gotten satisfactory results. The device also has one voice processing unit for noise suppression, voice isolation, and echo cancellation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recording device has impressive battery life. I went to a conference earlier this month with a fully charged device and recorded a few interviews and talks there. After that, I used the device for some phone call recording and personal note-taking. Despite all that use, the device still had 55% charge after 15 days. The company says you can wring 30 hours of continuous recording and 60 days of standby from a single charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaud’s new device comes with a proprietary charger with a USB-C cable on the other end. The device takes two hours to charge from 0%, and then you are set for at least a couple of weeks unless you are recording hours of content.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3040223\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg 3841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Black_side.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Plaud</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One problem with wearable AI devices is that you have to ensure, through an indicator, that the device is recording (or has stopped recording). Thankfully, Plaud Note Pro has a tiny screen that displays your recording status. You can also press a button while recording to highlight a point a speaker is making, and it will show up in the AI-powered summary prominently. The screen also shows you the remaining battery level.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is intentionality behind recording with this device. You also get haptic feedback for starting and stopping the recording. The visual indication and your action of pressing the button also make it easier to signal to others in the meeting that you are recording the session.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077732\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg 5712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1200,830 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1280,885 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=430,297 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=720,498 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=900,622 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=800,553 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=1536,1062 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=2048,1416 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=668,462 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=542,375 542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=892,617 892w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=708,489 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plaud-Pixel.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can choose to just record sessions and export them to another AI transcription service you are subscribed to.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was … nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Electricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/boom-supersonic-raises-300m-to-build-natural-gas-turbines-for-crusoe-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">repurposing supersonic jet engines</a> for data center duty and working on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/overview-energy-wants-to-beam-energy-from-space-to-existing-solar-farms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">beaming solar power down from space</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">projected to nearly triple</a> in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consumer frustration</a> around pricing and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drawn the ire of environmental groups</a> that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/gridcare-thinks-more-than-100-gw-of-data-center-capacity-is-hiding-in-the-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gridcare</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/yottar-wants-to-help-energy-users-find-capacity-on-the-electrical-grid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yottar</a> argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber-optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amid the data center boom.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Base Power, for example, is building one in Texas by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/base-power-raises-1b-to-deploy-home-batteries-everywhere/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">leasing batteries to homeowners</a> at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other startups, including Texture, Uplight, and Camus, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/texture-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developing software layers</a> to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&amp;D organization, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/nvidia-thinks-ai-can-solve-electrical-grid-problems-caused-by-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to develop industry-specific models</a> in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/google-thinks-ai-can-untangle-the-electrical-grids-bureaucracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working with the grid operator PJM</a> to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Utilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Software, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It’s cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Make sure to review the permissions you’re giving when you’re linking your accounts. For example, if you connect your Spotify account, ChatGPT can see your playlists, listening history, and other personal information.

Since then, optimists have regularly claimed that AI will become a critical part of the enterprise software industry, and so enterprise AI startups mushroomed on the back of immense amounts of investment.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But enterprises are still struggling to see the benefit of adopting these new AI tools. An <a href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MIT survey in August</a> found that 95% of enterprises weren’t getting a meaningful return on their investments in AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So when will businesses start seeing real benefits from using and integrating AI? TechCrunch surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs, and they overwhelmingly think 2026 will be the year when enterprises start to meaningfully adopt AI, see value from it, <em>and </em>increase their budgets for the tech.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise VCs have been saying that for three years now. Will 2026 actually be different? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s hear what they have to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend:</strong> Enterprises are realizing that LLMs are not a silver bullet for most problems. Just because Starbucks can use Claude to write their own CRM software doesn’t mean they should. We’ll focus on custom models, fine tuning, evals, observability, orchestration, and data sovereignty.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Molly Alter, partner, Northzone:</strong> A subset of enterprise AI companies will shift from product businesses to AI consulting. These companies may start with a specific product, such as AI customer support or AI coding agents. But once they have enough customer workflows running off their platform, they can replicate the forward-deployed engineer model with their own team to build additional use cases for customers. In other words, many specialized AI product companies will become generalist AI implementers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marcie Vu, partner, Greycroft:</strong> We’re very excited about the opportunity in voice AI. Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with each other and with machines. We’ve spent decades typing on computers and staring at screens, but speech is how we engage in the real world. I am eager to see how builders reimagine products, experiences, and interfaces with voice as the primary mode of interaction with intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner, Inspired Capital:</strong> 2026 will be the year AI reshapes the physical world — especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, and climate monitoring. We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one, where physical systems can sense problems before they become failures.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners:</strong> We’re watching how frontier labs approach the application layer. A lot of people assumed labs would just train models and hand them off for others to build on, but that doesn’t seem to be how they are thinking about it. We may see frontier labs shipping more turnkey applications directly into production in domains like finance, law, healthcare, and education than people expect. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Tom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean:</strong> If I had to pick one word for quantum in 2026, it’s momentum. Trust in quantum advantage is building fast, with companies publishing roadmaps to demystify the tech. But don’t expect major software breakthroughs yet; we still need more hardware performance to cross that threshold.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-areas-are-you-looking-to-invest-in-nbsp\">Which areas are you looking to invest in? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Emily Zhao, principal, Salesforce Ventures:</strong> We are targeting two distinct frontiers — AI entering the physical world and the next evolution of model research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> Future datacenter technology. For the last year or so, we’ve been standing up a few new investments that signal our interest in future “token factory” technology, with an eye towards what can really advance how efficiently and cleanly they run. This is going to continue in 2026 and beyond, in categories that include everything within the walls of the data center: cooling, compute, memory, and networking within and between sites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Vertical enterprise software where proprietary workflows and data create defensibility, particularly in regulated industries, supply chain, retail, and other complex operational environments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA:</strong> We are at the limit of humanity’s ability to generate enough energy to feed power-hungry GPUs. As an investor, I’m looking for software and hardware that can drive breakthroughs in performance per watt. This could be better GPU management, more efficient AI chips, next-gen networking approaches like optical, or rethinking thermal load within AI systems and data centers. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-it-comes-to-ai-startups-how-do-you-determine-that-a-company-has-a-moat-nbsp\">When it comes to AI startups, how do you determine that a company has a moat? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners:</strong> A moat in AI is less about the model itself and more about economics and integration. We look for companies that are deeply embedded in enterprise workflows, have access to proprietary or continuously improving data, and demonstrate defensibility through switching costs, cost advantages, or outcomes that are difficult to replicate.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: </strong>I’m skeptical of moats built purely on model performance or prompting — those advantages erode in months. The question I ask: If OpenAI or Anthropic launches a model tomorrow and is 10x better, does this company still have a reason to exist?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Molly Alter, partner, Northzone:</strong> It’s much easier today to build a moat in a vertical category rather than a horizontal one. The best moats are data moats, where each incremental customer, data point, or interaction makes the product better. These are somewhat easier to build in specialized categories like manufacturing, construction, health, or legal, where data is more consistent across customers. But there are also interesting “workflow moats,” where defensibility comes from understanding how a task or project moves from point A to point B in an industry.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Harsha Kapre, director, Snowflake Ventures:</strong> For AI startups, the strongest moat comes from how effectively they transform an enterprise’s existing data into better decisions, workflows, and customer experiences. Enterprises already sit on incredibly rich data; what they lack is the ability to reason over it in a targeted, trustworthy way. We look for startups that blend technical expertise with deep industry knowledge and can bring domain-specific solutions directly to a customer’s governed data, without creating new silos, to deliver insights or automation that weren’t previously possible.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-will-2026-be-the-year-when-enterprises-start-to-gain-value-from-ai-investments-nbsp\">Will 2026 be the year when enterprises start to gain value from AI investments? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend:</strong> Enterprises are realizing that random experiments with dozens of solutions create chaos. They will focus on fewer solutions with more thoughtful engagement.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures:</strong> The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces. In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Scott Beechuk, partner, Norwest Venture Partners:</strong> We’re definitely getting closer. If last year was about laying the infrastructure for AI, 2026 is when we begin to see whether the application layer can turn that investment into real value. As specialized models mature and oversight improves, AI systems are becoming more reliable in daily workflows.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital:</strong> Yes, but still incremental. There is still a lot of iteration, and AI is still improving to the point of being able to showcase pain-point solutions for enterprises across a variety of industries. I believe solving simulation to reality training will likely open up many opportunities for a selection of industries, both existing and nascent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz:</strong> There have been sensational headlines this year about enterprises not seeing returns on their AI investments. Ask any software engineer if they would ever want to go back to the dark ages before they had AI coding tools. Unlikely. My point is, enterprises are already gaining value this year, and it will multiply across organizations next year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-think-enterprises-will-increase-their-ai-budgets-in-2026-nbsp\">Do you think enterprises will increase their AI budgets in 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire:</strong> Yes, I believe they will, though it’s nuanced. Rather than simply increasing AI budgets, organizations will shift portions of their labor spend toward AI technologies or generate such strong top-line ROI from AI capabilities that the investment effectively pays for itself three to five times over. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners:</strong> Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else. Overall spend may grow, but it will be significantly more concentrated. We expect a bifurcation, where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Gordon Ritter, founder and general partner, Emergence Capital:</strong> Yes, but spend will concentrate. Enterprises will increase budgets where AI expands on institutional advantages, and pull back from tools that simply automate workflows without capturing (and securing!) proprietary intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures:</strong> 2026 will be the year that CIOs push back on AI vendor sprawl. Today, enterprises are testing out multiple tools for a single use case — monthly spend and switching costs are low in many cases, so the incentive to experiment is there — and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts]. As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools, and deploy those savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ryan Isono, managing director, Maverick Ventures:</strong> In aggregate, yes, and there will be some shifting from pilots/experimental budgets to budgeted line items. A boon for AI startups in 2026 will be the transition of enterprises who tried to build in-house solutions and have now realized the difficulty and complexity required in production at scale.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-take-to-raise-a-series-a-as-an-enterprise-focused-ai-startup-in-2026-nbsp\">What does it take to raise a Series A as an enterprise-focused AI startup in 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> The best companies right now combine two things: a compelling “why now” narrative — usually tied to GenAI creating new attack surfaces, infrastructure needs, or workflow opportunities — and concrete proof of enterprise adoption. One million dollars to $2 million [annual recurring revenue] is the baseline, but what matters more than that is whether customers view you and your product as mission-critical to their business versus just being a nice-to-have. Revenue without narrative is a feature; narrative without traction is vaporware. You need both. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners:</strong> You should aim to show you’re building in a space where the [total addressable market] expands rather than evaporates as AI drives down costs. Some markets have high elasticity of demand — a 90% price decline leads to a 10x increase in market size. Others have low elasticity, where dropping the price can vaporize the market, so the customers keep all of the value being created. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Customers are using the product in real, day-to-day operations and are willing to take reference calls and talk honestly about impact, reliability, and buying process, etc. Companies should be able to clearly show how the product saves time, reduces cost, or increases output in a way that holds up through security, legal, and procurement reviews. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> We (investors) were casting a doubtful eye towards [estimated annual recurring revenue] or pilot revenue until recently. Now it’s not seen as much of an asterisk as much as the customer’s interest and willingness to evaluate a solution in the face of so many options pushed their way. Getting those engagements and customer buy-in in terms of running an evaluation isn’t just a matter of forward-deployed engineers making it easier for the customer. It takes quality and a winning marketing message to do it in 2026. Investors are expecting to see conversions become the leading part of the story after six months of pilot use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital:</strong> Execution and traction. The best signal is users genuinely delighted to use the product and the technical sophistication of the business. We look at a huge north star of real contractual agreements, 12+ months. In addition to that, was this founder able to attract top-tier talent to join their startup over competitors or the traditional hyper-scalers?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-role-will-ai-agents-play-at-enterprises-by-the-end-of-2026-nbsp\">What role will AI agents play at enterprises by the end of 2026? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Nnamdi Okike, managing partner and co-founder, 645 Ventures:</strong> Agents will still be in their initial adoption phase by the end of 2026. There are many technical and compliance hurdles that need to be overcome for enterprises to truly benefit from AI agents. There also need to be standards created for agent-to-agent communication. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire:</strong> One universal agent will emerge. Today, each agent is siloed in its role — for example, inbound [sales development representative], outbound SDR, customer support, product discovery, etc. But by late next year, we’ll start to see these roles converge into a single agent with shared context and memory, breaking down long-standing organizational silos, and enabling a more unified, contextual conversation between companies and their users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures:</strong> The winners will be organizations that figure out the right balance of autonomy and oversight quickly and that recognize agent deployment as collaborative augmentation rather than a clean division of labor. Rather than agents handling all routine work while humans do all the thinking, we’ll see more sophisticated collaboration between humans and agents on complex tasks, with the boundary between their roles continuously evolving. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA:</strong> The majority of knowledge workers will have at least one agentic co-worker they know by name! </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Eric Bahn, co-founder, general partner, Hustle Fund:</strong> I think that AI agents will probably be the bigger part of the workforce than any humans in enterprises. Proliferating AI agents is essentially free and zero marginal cost. So why not grow through bots? </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-kinds-of-companies-in-your-portfolio-are-seeing-the-strongest-growth-nbsp\">What kinds of companies in your portfolio are seeing the strongest growth? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> The companies growing fastest are the ones that identified a workflow or security gap created by GenAI adoption, then executed relentlessly on product-market fit. In cybersecurity, it’s tools addressing data security so LLMs can interact with sensitive data safely, and agent governance ensuring autonomous systems have appropriate controls. In marketing, it’s new areas like Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — getting discovered in AI responses, not just search results. The common thread: These weren’t categories two years ago but are now must-haves for enterprises deploying AI at scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures:</strong> We’re seeing growth tied to a few common themes. One is companies that land with focused use cases — companies that start with a narrower wedge (could be a focused target persona or use case), really nail it, become sticky and earn the right to expand from the initial wedge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz:</strong> Companies that help enterprises put AI into production are doing well. Areas like data extraction and structuring, developer productivity for AI systems, infrastructure for generative media, voice and audio for media, and apps like support or call centers. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-kinds-of-companies-are-seeing-the-strongest-retention-nbsp\">What kinds of companies are seeing the strongest retention? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital:</strong> Companies with retention and expansion share a pattern — they solve problems that intensify as customers deploy more AI. Strong retention comes from three things: being mission-critical (removal breaks production workflows), accumulating proprietary context that’s hard to re-create, and solving problems that grow with AI adoption rather than being one-and-done. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Tom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean:</strong> Retention is trickier to measure for younger companies, but the highest retention we’re seeing is in the serious enterprise software providers, especially those enhanced with AI. A good example is <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/KiOXC93z2zCxkYp1u1ujFqkGSr?domain=openocean.vc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Operations1</a>, which digitizes employee-led production processes end-to-end. These companies go deep into the customer’s organization, transform how they operate, and build up proprietary data and knowledge that makes them very hard to do without. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12:</strong> Startups serving the enterprise in data tooling and vertical AI apps, with forward-deployed teams assisting in customer satisfaction, quality, and product improvement. This seems to be the winning formula that has been adopted by all leading startups in those markets. Longer term, the embedded teams might recede as the customers start to internalize the use of AI in their organizations and workday practices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench:</strong> Retention is highest where software becomes foundational infrastructure rather than a point solution. AuthZed has strong retention because authorization and policy sit at the core of modern systems and are extremely costly to rip out once embedded. Courier Health and GovWell act as systems of record and orchestration layers for end-to-end workflows, patient journeys in healthcare, and permitting in government, which makes them deeply embedded once live.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
