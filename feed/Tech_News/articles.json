But legal experts and startups say the order could prolong uncertainty, sparking court battles that leave young companies navigating shifting state requirements while waiting to see if Congress can agree on a single national framework. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/one-rule-trump-says-hell-sign-an-executive-order-blocking-state-ai-laws-despite-bipartisan-pushback/?_thumbnail_id=2812319\">order</a>, titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” directs the Department of Justice to set up a task force within 30 days to challenge certain state laws on the grounds that AI is interstate commerce and should be regulated federally. It gives the Commerce Department 90 days to compile a list of “onerous” state AI laws, an assessment that could affect states’ eligibility for federal funds, including broadband grants.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also asks the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to explore federal standards that could preempt state rules and instructs the administration to work with Congress on a uniform AI law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order lands amid a broader push to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/the-race-to-regulate-ai-has-sparked-a-federal-vs-state-showdown/\">rein in state-by-state AI rules</a> after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/us-senate-removes-controversial-ai-moratorium-from-budget-bill/\">efforts</a> in Congress to pause state regulation stalled. Lawmakers in both parties have argued that without a federal standard, blocking states from acting could leave consumers exposed and companies largely unchecked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This David Sacks-led executive order is a gift for Silicon Valley oligarchs who are using their influence in Washington to shield themselves and their companies from accountability,” said Michael Kleinman, Head of U.S. Policy at the Future of Life Institute, which focuses on reducing extreme risks from transformative technologies, in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto policy czar, has been a leading voice behind the administration’s AI preemption push.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even supporters of a national framework concede the order doesn’t create one. With state laws still enforceable unless courts block them or states pause enforcement, startups could face an extended transition period.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sean Fitzpatrick, CEO of LexisNexis North America, U.K., and Ireland, tells TechCrunch that states will defend their consumer protection authority in court, with cases likely escalating to the Supreme Court. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While supporters argue the order could reduce certainty by centralizing the fight over AI regulation in Washington, critics say the legal battles will create immediate headwinds for startups navigating conflicting state and federal demands. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because startups are prioritizing innovation, they typically do not have…robust regulatory governance programs until they reach a scale that requires a program,” Hart Brown, principal author of Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt’s Task Force on AI and Emerging Technology recommendations, told TechCrunch. “These programs can be expensive and time-consuming to meet a very dynamic regulatory environment.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arul Nigam, co-founder at Circuit Breaker Labs, a startup that performs red-teaming for conversational and mental health AI chatbots, echoed those concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s uncertainty in terms of do [AI companion and chatbot companies] have to self-regulate?” Nigam told TechCrunch, noting the patchwork of state AI laws does hurt smaller startups in his field. “Are there open-source standards they should adhere to? Should they continue building?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that he is hopeful that Congress could move more quickly now to pass a better federal framework. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Gamino-Cheong, CTO and co-founder of AI governance company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/9tH2CYVJMJcNlvgOh0f1Fx_PZt?domain=trustible.ai/\">Trustible</a>, told TechCrunch the EO will backfire on AI innovation and pro-AI goals: “Big Tech and the big AI startups have the funds to hire lawyers to help them figure out what to do, or they can simply hedge their bets. The uncertainty does hurt startups the most, especially those that can’t get billions of funding almost at will,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that legal ambiguity makes it harder to sell to risk-sensitive customers like legal teams, financial firms, and healthcare organizations, increasing sales cycles, system work, and insurance costs. “Even the perception that AI is unregulated will reduce trust in AI,” which is already low and threatens adoption, Gamino-Cheong said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gary Kibel, a partner at Davis + Gilbert, said businesses would welcome a single national standard, but “an executive order is not necessarily the right vehicle to override laws that states have duly enacted.” He warned that the current uncertainty leaves open two extremes: highly restrictive rules or no action at all, either creating a “wild west” that favors big tech’s ability to absorb risk and wait things out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Morgan Reed, president of The App Association, meanwhile, urged Congress to quickly enact a “comprehensive, targeted, and risk-based national AI framework. We can’t have a patchwork of state AI laws, and a lengthy court fight over the constitutionality of an Executive Order isn’t any better.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The tech giant is also bringing advanced Gemini capabilities to Google Translate and expanding its language learning tools in the Translate app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new real-time headphone translations experience keeps each speaker’s tone, emphasis, and cadence intact, so it’s easier to follow the conversation and tell who’s saying what, Google says. The new capability essentially turns any pair of headphones into a real-time, one-way translation device. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whether you’re trying to have a conversation in a different language, listen to a speech or lecture while abroad, or watch a TV show or film in another language, you can now put in your headphones, open the Translate app, tap ‘Live translate’ and hear a real-time translation in your preferred language,” said Rose Yao, Google VP Product Management, Search Verticals, in a blog post. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075555\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png 1174w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=150,148 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=300,297 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=768,760 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=680,673 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=430,426 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=720,713 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=900,891 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=800,792 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=668,661 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=379,375 379w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=623,617 623w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=536,531 536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-12-at-10.02.57-AM.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The beta is rolling out now in the Translate app on Android in the U.S., Mexico, and India.

They’ll also enable improved translations of phrases with more nuanced meanings, like slang, idioms, or local expressions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, if you’re trying to translate an English idiom like “stealing my thunder,” you’ll now get a more accurate translation instead of a literal word-for-word translation, as Gemini will parse the context to capture what the idiom really means.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?w=544\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075556\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=960,1200 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=1024,1280 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=344,430 344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=576,720 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=720,900 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=640,800 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=534,668 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=300,375 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=494,617 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=425,531 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Text-Translations-Still.png?resize=40,50 40w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This update is rolling out now in the U.S. and India, translating between English and nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and German.

So it’s almost as if those photos go into the ether,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The addition, to some extent, is pushback against the growing trend of AI-generated content and “for you” feed-style algorithms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As people engage with those platforms more and more, something that has to be true and will be true is that people will still want to see more of their friends,” Sharp says. “The photos and videos you take will need to find a place where they can reach the intended audience.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?w=313\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075597\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg 1260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=768,1668 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=553,1200 553w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=332,720 332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=308,668 308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=245,531 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Retro</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although nearly half (45.7%) of Retro’s users participate in the app on a daily basis, the Rewind feature could boost that engagement even higher.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To try Rewind, you can either launch it from the end of the row of shared photos, just past the “this week in” card, or from its more prominent position as the middle tab in the bottom navigation bar. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When launched, there’s a haptic response as the screen starts cycling through the older photos pulled from your Camera Roll. These memories aren’t being shared, but you can tap on the share icon if you feel inspired to send them to a friend or post them. In addition, you can opt to hide photos you’d rather not see (like those of an ex), or tap a “dice” icon to be taken to a random memory instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the iPod-inspired dial clicks back into your past, you’ll feel a subtle vibration as each new memory loads. You can also spin the dial to move forward or backward in time, watching the photos from months and years’ past flip by on the screen, pausing at those you want to view longer or share. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?w=313\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075601\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=244,531 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Retro screenshot/TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can press and hold on any photo to see it uncropped, and when you share a photo, a timestamp is added at the bottom so friends will understand it’s not a new pic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While screenshots won’t appear in this photo archive, other photos — like those of receipts or whiteboards at work will show up, as they could still be interesting memories to you. (And if you come across a photo you don’t need to keep, deleting it from the app will also delete it from your Camera Roll.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea to look back at older photo memories is hardly new, of course.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/22/timehop-series-b-10-million-shasta/\">a startup called Timehop popularized the idea</a> of doing something more with our growing digital photo archives by allowing users to revisit old photos through its simple mobile app. Later, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/24/facehop/\">Facebook copied the idea for its “On This Day” feature</a>, and photo-hosting services like Google Photos and Apple Photos added memories features of their own. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Sharp doesn’t believe these will be direct competitors for Retro. Facebook, over the years, has downranked friends’ content as its feed became filled with links, news, and ads. Meanwhile, people tend to think of Apple and Google’s photo apps more as utilities for managing and storing photos, not as social apps like Retro.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The researcher found the exposed token and tried to privately alert Home Depot to its security lapse but was ignored for several weeks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposure is now fixed after TechCrunch contacted company representatives last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Security researcher Ben Zimmermann told TechCrunch that, in early November, he found a published GitHub access token belonging to a Home Depot employee, which was exposed sometime in early 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he tested the token, Zimmermann said that it granted access to hundreds of private Home Depot source code repositories hosted on GitHub and allowed the ability to modify their contents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researcher said the keys allowed access to Home Depot’s cloud infrastructure, including its order fulfillment and inventory management systems, and code development pipelines, among other systems. Home Depot has hosted much of its developer and engineering infrastructure on GitHub since 2015, according to a <a href=\"https://github.com/customer-stories/homedepot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">customer profile on GitHub’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zimmermann said he sent several emails to Home Depot but didn’t hear back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nor did he get a response from Home Depot’s chief information security officer, Chris Lanzilotta, after sending a message over LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zimmermann told TechCrunch that he has disclosed several similar exposures in recent months to companies, which have thanked him for his findings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Home Depot is the only company that ignored me,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that Home Depot does not have a way to report security flaws, such as a vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program, Zimmermann contacted TechCrunch in an effort to get the exposure fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch on December 5, Home Depot spokesperson George Lane acknowledged receipt of our email but did not respond to follow-up emails asking for comment. The exposed token is no longer online, and the researcher said the token’s access was revoked soon after our outreach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We also asked Lane if Home Depot has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if anyone else used the token during the months it was left online to access any of Home Depot’s internal systems. We did not hear back.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Hama Film’s booths not only print out the photos like a typical photo booth, but booths also upload the customers’ photos to the company’s servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vibecast, which owns Hama Film, has yet to respond to his messages alerting the company of the issues. Vibecast also hasn’t responded to several requests for comment from TechCrunch, nor did Vibecast’s co-founder Joel Park respond to a message we sent via LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of Friday, the researcher said the company has still not fully resolved the security flaw and continues to expose customers’ data. As such, TechCrunch is withholding specific details of the vulnerability from publication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Zeacer first found this flaw, he noted that it appeared that photos were deleted from the photo booth maker’s servers every two to three weeks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, he said, the pictures stored on the servers appear to get deleted after 24 hours, which limits the number of pictures exposed at any given time. But a hacker could still exploit the vulnerability he discovered each day and download the contents of every photo and video on the server. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before this week, Zeacer said at one point he saw more than 1,000 pictures online for the Hama Film booths in Melbourne. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This incident is the latest example of a company that, at least for a time, was not implementing certain basic and widely accepted security practices, such as rate-limiting. Last month, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/bug-in-jury-systems-used-by-several-us-states-exposed-sensitive-personal-data/\">TechCrunch reported that government contractor giant Tyler Technologies</a> was not rate-limiting its websites used for allowing courts to manage their jurors’ personal information. This meant anyone could break into any juror’s profile by running a computer script capable of mass-guessing their date of birth and their easy-to-guess numerical identifier. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And a number of automakers, big and small, are trying to bring that same level of autonomy to personally owned vehicles over the next few years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that happens, what kinds of things could you do with a personal AV? Maybe you’ll be able to send it to pick up food or run errands — the hope of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/autolane-is-building-air-traffic-control-for-autonomous-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">company called Autolane</a>. Or, if you’re Tesla CEO Elon Musk, you think owners will want to deploy their cars into the world to offer rides to other people, creating a tidy, nearly effortless side-hustle.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hebron Sher, co-founder of Dallas-based Zevo, is eager to capitalize on all of the above. The company has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/zevos-ev-only-car-share-fleet-is-helping-tesla-owners-make-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">operating an EV-only car-share fleet</a> for a little over a year, and it’s now adding robotaxis, starting with a new company called Tensor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tensor is kind of an odd duck. The startup <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/758605/tensor-autox-autonomous-vehicle-robocar-personal-own-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sort of emerged earlier this year</a> from a previous Silicon Valley startup called AutoX that also had operations in China, and boldly claims that it will be the first to sell a fully autonomous car to regular consumers — in 2026, no less. Zevo says it will purchase up to 100 of Tensor’s cars and add them to its network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There aren’t a lot of details on timing, and Tensor still needs to show that it can build cars at any kind of scale and reliability, which are massive hurdles that have tripped up many other newcomers in recent years. (The company said in a statement that its “path to shipping is driven by the pacing of global regulatory approvals, not product limitations.) If it works, Zevo customers would essentially be able to borrow the Tensor AVs in what amounts to a sort of decentralized robotaxi service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement resembles the many heady-yet-ultimately-unmet promises that were made a decade ago, when the self-driving car hype first peaked. But with real robotaxis on the roads now, the idea seems a <em>little</em> more tangible this time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Tensor’s vision is to build a future where everyone owns their own Artificial General Intelligence — a personal AGI that enables more time, freedom and autonomy,” Hugo Fozzati, Tensor’s chief business officer, said in a statement. “For us, this partnership with Zevo is not only just a batch sale of our vehicles, but also enables individuals and micro-entrepreneurs to participate and profit from AV business in this AI era.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It won’t be Sher’s first bet on an unproven company. In October, Zevo announced a non-binding order of 1,000 vans from <a href=\"https://investors.ff.com/news-releases/news-release-details/faraday-future-founder-and-co-ceo-yt-jia-shares-weekly-14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">perpetually imperiled EV startup, Faraday Future</a>. Faraday, which has struggled for a decade to make and sell its flagship FF91 luxury SUV, recently resorted to importing more affordable electric vans from China and assembling them in the U.S. The company is supposed to assemble the first of those later this month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sher’s willingness to bet on these companies stems from two reasons. One is cost: Tensor and Faraday Future have nonexistent and bad track records, respectively, and so they’re willing to cut an attractive deal. More importantly, Sher said, these companies are more willing than a major OEM to allow Zevo to tightly integrate with their vehicles’ software — a crucial factor if you’re going to allow peer-to-peer sharing, especially of robotaxis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not only is it tougher to get legacy automakers to be similarly flexible, but Sher said their “tech freaking sucks.” With newcomers, he said, “the synergy of startup and startup, sort of mingling, commingling together, and saying, ‘Let’s build a solution side by side…’ I think I’ve really enjoyed that experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sher paints the Tensor deal as a win-win for both companies: Tensor gets an early customer and a shot to prove that its robocars are real and can do what it promises; Zevo gets a good deal and that deep software integration. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, he admits it’s a “calculated risk.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that’s what makes America great, you know, the fact that we do encourage startups to take risk,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to reflect that AutoX was headquartered in Silicon Valley.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It facilitates knowledge sharing from one user to other users. It is not a significant purpose of the site to enable interactions engaged in because of a particular user’s relationship with or interest in another user as a person […] Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become ‘friends’ with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events,” the filing reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/1pkbpw1/a_more_effective_approach_to_protecting_youth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> accompanying the filing, Reddit admin LastBluejay said the law carries “some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren’t,” the post reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit also points out that a significant portion of content on social media platforms is accessible without an account, and kids under 16 years old would be more easily protected if they were allowed to have accounts that could then be restricted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company says that, in a world roiled by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/as-ai-fueled-disinformation-explodes-here-comes-the-startup-counterattack/\">AI-generated digital fakery</a>, it hopes to create digital “proof of human” tools that can help separate the humans from the bots. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a small gathering at World’s headquarters in San Francisco on Thursday, Altman and World’s co-founder and CEO, Alex Blania, briefly introduced the new version of the app (which developers have termed a “super app”) before the product team took over to explain <a href=\"https://world.org/blog/announcements/the-new-world-app-secure-chat-global-payments-and-mini-apps-for-everyone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the new features</a>. During his remarks, Altman said that the concept for World grew out of conversations he and Blania had had about the need to create a new kind of economic model. That model, based around web3 principles, is what World has been trying to accomplish through its verification network. “It’s really hard to both identify unique people and do that in a privacy-preserving way,” said Altman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">World Chat, the app’s new messenger, seems designed to do just that. It uses end-to-end encryption to keep users’ conversations safe (this encryption is described as being equivalent to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/signal-introduces-free-and-paid-backup-plans-for-your-chats/\">Signal</a>, the privacy-focused messenger), and also leverages color-coded speech bubbles to alert users to whether the person they’re talking to has been verified by World’s system or not, the company said. The idea is to incentivize verification, giving people the power to know whether the person they’re talking to is who they say they are. Chat was originally <a href=\"https://world.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-chat-connect-send-money-real-humans-world-network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched in beta</a> in March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other big feature reveal on Thursday was an expanded digital payment system that allows app users to send and receive cryptocurrency. World app has functioned as a digital wallet for some time, but the newest version of the app includes broader capabilities. Using virtual bank accounts, users can also receive paychecks directly into World App and make deposits from their bank accounts, both of which can then be converted into crypto. You don’t have be verified by World’s authentication system to use these features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tiago Sada, World’s chief product officer, told TechCrunch that part of the reason chat was added was to create a more interactive experience for users. “What we kept hearing from people is that they wanted a more social World app,” Sada said. World Chat is designed to fill that need, creating what Sada says is a secure way to communicate. “It took a lot of work to make this feature-rich messenger that is similar to a WhatsApp or a Telegram, but with encryption and security of something that is a lot closer to Signal,” Sada said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">World (which was originally called Worldcoin) deploys a unique authentication process: Interested humans get their eyes scanned at one of the company’s offices, where the Orb — a large verification device — converts the person’s iris into a unique and encrypted digital code. That code, the verified World ID, can then be used by the person to interact with World’s ecosystem of services, which are available through its app.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The addition of more social-friendly features is clearly meant to drive broader adoption of the app, which makes sense since scaling verification is the company’s main challenge. Altman has said that he would like the project to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-orb-eye-scanning-startup-billion-user-goal-viability-2025-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">scan a billion people’s eyes</a>, but Tools for Humanity claims to have scanned less than 20 million people.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since standing in long lines at a corporate office to have your eyeballs scanned by a giant metallic ball may seem slightly less than enticing to some users, the company has already sought to make its verification process less cumbersome. In April, Tools for Humanity <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/sam-altmans-world-unveils-a-mobile-verification-device/\">announced its</a> Orb Minis — hand-held, phone-like devices — that allow users to scan their own eyes from the comfort of their homes. Blania previously told TechCrunch that, eventually, the company would like to turn the Orb Minis into a mobile point-of-sale device or sell its ID sensor tech to device manufacturers. If the company takes such steps, it would drop the barrier to verification significantly, potentially inspiring much more widespread adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After uncovering allegations of research misconduct spanning two decades, Baker — just one month into college — found himself “receiving anonymous letters, conducting stakeouts, and tracking down confidential sources,” <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/760317/how-to-rule-the-world-by-theo-baker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to his publisher</a>. Meanwhile, high-powered lawyers tried to discredit his work. By year’s end, Tessier-Lavigne had resigned, and Baker became the youngest-ever recipient of the George Polk Award, one of journalism’s most prestigious honors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after, Warner Bros. and famed producer Amy Pascal won a <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/11/amy-pascal-movie-stanford-president-research-scandal-resignation-1235590262/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">competitive auction</a> for the film rights to his story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if that scandal put Baker on the map, his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley’s startup machine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How to Rule the World,” out May 19 — three weeks before he graduates — promises an explosive look at how venture capitalists treat Stanford students as “a commodity,” wooing favored undergrads with slush funds, shell companies, yacht parties, and funding offers before they even have business ideas in their hunt for the next trillion-dollar founder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I watched in real time as my peers were taught to cut corners and plied with enormous wealth by people who wanted to exploit their talent,” Baker, who turns 21 next month, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/11/expose-by-college-senior-theo-baker-will-go-inside-stanford-as-posh-recruiting-pool-for-silicon-valley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tells Axios</a>. Drawing on more than 250 interviews with students, CEOs, VCs, Nobel laureates, and three Stanford presidents, the book aims to expose what Baker describes to Axios as a “weird, money-soaked subculture that has so much influence over the rest of the world.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s perhaps an unsurprising move from someone who grew up around top journalists. His father is New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker, and his mother is The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser. While his peers chase venture capital funding and six-figure startup salaries, Baker spent his sophomore year reporting and took his junior year off to write, including two months at the Yaddo writers’ retreat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That choice becomes even more striking against the backdrop of journalism’s current struggles. While traditional journalism programs fail to fill classes and media outfits face seemingly relentless layoffs, Baker represents something both exciting and increasingly uncommon: a star student betting his career on accountability journalism. Whether he’s a harbinger of renewed interest in investigative reporting remains to be seen, but we’d guess his book will capture the attention of plenty of college students — and it will almost certainly make waves in Silicon Valley while doing it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It now allows developers to embed Google’s SATA-model research capabilities into their own apps. That capability is made possible through Google’s new <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/developers/interactions-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Interactions API</a>, which is designed to give devs more control in the coming agentic AI era. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Gemini Deep Research tool is an agent equipped to synthesize mountains of information and handle a large context dump in the prompt. Google says it’s used by customers for tasks ranging from due diligence to drug toxicity safety research. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google also says it will soon be integrating this new deep research agent into services, including Google Search, Google Finance, its Gemini App, and its popular NotebookLM. This is another step toward preparing for a world where humans don’t Google anything anymore — their AI agents do. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant says that Deep Research benefits from Gemini 3 Pro’s status as its “most factual” model that is trained to minimize hallucinations during complex tasks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI hallucinations — where the LLM just makes stuff up — are an especially crucial issue for long-running, deep reasoning agentic tasks, in which many autonomous decisions are made over minutes, hours, or longer. The more choices an LLM has to make, the greater the chance that even one hallucinated choice will invalidate the entire output. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To prove its progress claims, Google has also created yet another benchmark (as if the AI world needs another one). The new benchmark is unimaginatively named DeepSearchQA and is intended to test agents on complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks. Google has open sourced this benchmark.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also tested Deep Research on Humanity’s Last Exam, a much more interestingly named, independent benchmark of general knowledge filled with impossibly niche tasks; and BrowserComp, a benchmark for browser-based agentic tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As you might expect, Google’s new agent bested the competition on its own benchmark, and Humanity’s. However, OpenAI’s ChatGPT 5 Pro was a surprisingly close second all the way around and slightly bested Google on BrowserComp. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But those benchmark comparisons were obsolete almost the moment Google published them. Because on the same day, OpenAI launched its highly anticipated GPT 5.2 — codenamed Garlic. OpenAI says its newest model bests its rivals — especially Google — on a suite of the typical benchmarks, including OpenAI’s homegrown one. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of this announcement was the timing. Knowing that the world was awaiting the release of Garlic, Google dropped some AI news of its own.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The $20,000 price tag automatically limits the potential pool of consumer customers too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Neo specifically also comes with a privacy element that would be hard to swallow for many people — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/i-tried-the-robot-thats-coming-to-live-with-you-its-still-part-human-68515d44?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdD1hZ8nNTH85OJ6pCEoSHR7hBC8ZeyuTwSas6HVo-5RVip4oGMyv3wZfpX1bI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693af506&amp;gaa_sig=H31v4w64kgyXt1bZRWvBB3yNyYp9Jfz_-DAQrg2Y1xbNLiEPnHsnF7VAXQ86jVkVXrplVVfCbcxfoCbCpsEAcA%3D%3D\">human operators from 1X are able to look through the robots eyes</a> into someone’s home.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humanoids also come with potential safety issues around pets and small children due to their size and instability. Multiple VCs and scientists in the robotics field told TechCrunch this summer that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-world-is-just-not-quite-ready-for-humanoids-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">humanoid adoption wouldn’t be for multiple years</a>, if not a decade away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company declined to share how many preorders it received for its Neo bot but a spokesperson said preorders “far exceeded” the company’s goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2014, 1x has since raised more than $130 million in venture capital from firms, including EQT Ventures, Tiger Global, and the OpenAI Startup Fund, among others.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It was raised almost entirely from individuals. We ended up with 105 LPs,” she said. “If you don’t have a track record, then what they’re investing in is you. Like it is basically, like, raising a gigantic angel round with no lead.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that outsider perspective, she’s been able to position herself as the call founders make before they meet with their board to practice and discuss strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Fubini encourages the leadership teams he works with to carefully consider who they are entering into partnership with. His rubric follows three core tenets: person, firm, terms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You work with this person for forever. So it’s everything from like, are they fun? Do you trust them? Do they have the juice to get the deal done? It’s everything around this human,” he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both VCs noted the change from the most recent 2022-23 bear market — where VCs held all the cards  — to the current eager dealmaking atmosphere where founders have a bit more power. This makes choosing the right VCs that much more important, they say. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fubini called this shift “thrilling” because, even though both sides still need to do their diligence and ensure they are good fit together, “you can move so quickly” compared to  cautious bear markets. “I think that’s fun and joyful,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both Feinzaig and Fubini are full of tactical advice for both VCs seeking creative ways to capture founder attention and founders seeking smartest choices for their cap tables. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pitch deck and cold emails may not have the power they once did but creating authentic relationships and proving on execution remains the best strategies to attract the kind of people you want to work with — from both perspectives.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>New episodes of Build Mode drop every Thursday. </em><a href=\"https://pod.link/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vWUZMNjEyNzkzNjQ5NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Subscribe to the podcast </em></a><em>or watch on </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TechCrunch/featured\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>.

However, the company lost a little ground on its related lawsuit against Apple, which was also over in-app purchase restrictions and commission structure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Epic Games launched a version of its Fortnite game that routed around the existing in-app payment systems on iOS and Android devices in 2020, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/fortnite-app-store-removed-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google</a> removed the game from their respective app stores. Epic Games used that move to then file antitrust lawsuits against both companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Apple’s case, the court ruled the iPhone maker was not a monopolist but said Apple needed to allow developers to point to other payment mechanisms if they chose. Apple has been fighting the specific terms of that agreement, which were today <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-appeals-court-partly-reverses-sanctions-against-apple-epic-games-antitrust-2025-12-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partially overturned</a> by an appeals court that called some of the restrictions “overbroad.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of note, the new filing states Apple can tell developers not to make their links to payments bigger or more prominent than Apple’s own. It also says Apple is allowed to charge a fee on purchases made outside its App Store. The latter is a significant blow to developers, who had finally been able to skirt Apple’s commission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Epic Games has reason to celebrate by returning to the Google Play Store after Google lost its court battle with the game developer, where it was ruled to have engaged in anticompetitive behavior. Under the new agreement, Google allows app developers to point to alternative payment mechanisms and caps the fees Google could charge.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/epic-games-ceo-calls-googles-antitrust-settlement-a-win-for-androids-vision-as-an-open-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">called it a “comprehensive solution”</a> that doubled down on Android as an open platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Apple ruling is below: </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"View Epic v Apple - 9th Circuit Order - 20251211 on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/964701553/Epic-v-Apple-9th-Circuit-Order-20251211#from_embed\"> Epic v Apple – 9th Circuit Order – 20251211 </a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"View TechCrunch's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/publisher/17551504/TechCrunch#from_embed\"> TechCrunch </a> </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The code red called for a shift in priorities, including stalling on commitments like introducing ads and instead focusing on creating a better ChatGPT experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5.2 is OpenAI’s push to reclaim leadership, even as some employees <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/client/auth?state=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fai%2Fopenai-sam-altman-google-code-red-c3a312ad%3Fst%3DYvoLtR%26reflink%3Darticle_copyURL_share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> asked for the model release to be pushed back so the company could have more time to improve it. And despite indications that OpenAI would focus its attention on consumer use cases by adding more personalization and customization to ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-5.2 looks to beef up its enterprise opportunities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is specifically targeting developers and the tooling ecosystem, aiming to become the default foundation for building AI-powered applications. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/openai-boasts-enterprise-win-days-after-internal-code-red-on-google-threat/?_thumbnail_id=3073655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI released new data</a> showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This comes as Gemini 3 has become tightly integrated into Google’s product and cloud ecosystem for multimodal and agentic workflows. Google this week launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-going-all-in-on-mcp-servers-agent-ready-by-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">managed MCP servers</a> that make its Google and Cloud services like Maps and BigQuery easier for agents to plug into. (MCPs are the connectors between AI systems and data and tools.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says GPT-5.2 sets new benchmark scores in coding, math, science, vision, long-context reasoning, and tool use, which the company claims could lead to “more reliable agentic workflows, production-grade code, and complex systems that operate across large contexts and real-world data.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those capabilities put it in direct competition with Gemini 3’s Deep Think mode, which has been touted as a major reasoning advancement targeting math, logic, and science. On OpenAI’s own benchmark chart, GPT-5.2 Thinking edges out Gemini 3 and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 in nearly every listed reasoning test, from real-world software engineering tasks (SWE-Bench Pro) and doctoral-level science knowledge (GPQA Diamond) to abstract reasoning and pattern discovery (ARC-AGI suites). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Research lead Aidan Clark said that stronger math scores aren’t just about solving equations. Mathematical reasoning, he explained, is a proxy for whether a model can follow multi-step logic, keep numbers consistent over time, and avoid subtle errors that could compound over time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are all properties that really matter across a wide range of different workloads,” Clark said. “Things like financial modeling, forecasting, doing an analysis of data.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the briefing, OpenAI product lead Max Schwarzer said GPT-5.2 “makes substantial improvements to code generation and debugging” and can walk through complex math and logic step by step. Coding startups like Windsurf and CharlieCode, he added, report “state-of-the-art agent coding performance” and measurable gains on complex multi-step workflows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond coding, Schwarzer said that GPT-5.2 Thinking responses contain 38% fewer errors than its predecessor, making the model more dependable for day-to-day decision-making, research, and writing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5.2 appears to be less a reinvention and more of a consolidation of OpenAI’s last two upgrades. GPT-5, which dropped in August, was a reset that laid the groundwork for a unified system with a router to toggle the model between a fast default model and a deeper “Thinking” mode. November’s GPT-5.1 focused on making that system warmer, more conversational, and better suited to agentic and coding tasks. The latest model, GPT-5.2, seems to turn up the dial on all of those advancements, making it a more reliable foundation for production use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For OpenAI, the stakes have never been higher. The company has made commitments to the tune of $1.4 trillion for AI infrastructure buildouts over the next few years to support its growth — commitments it made when it still had the first-mover advantage among AI companies. But now that Google, which lagged behind at the start, is pushing ahead, that bet might be what’s driving Altman’s “code red.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s renewed focus on reasoning models is also a risky flex. The systems behind its Thinking and Deep Research modes are more expensive to run than standard chatbots because they chew through more compute. By doubling down on that kind of model with GPT-5.2, OpenAI may be setting up a vicious cycle: spend more on compute to win the leaderboard, then spend even more to keep those high-cost models running at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is already reportedly spending more on compute than it had previously let on. As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/leaked-documents-shed-light-into-how-much-openai-pays-microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch reported</a> recently, most of OpenAI’s inference spend — the money it spends on compute to run a trained AI model — is being paid in cash rather than through cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the call, Simo suggested that as OpenAI scales, it is able to offer more products and services to generate more revenue to pay for additional compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But I think it’s important to place that in the grand arc of efficiency,” Simo said. “You are getting, today, a lot more intelligence for the same amount of compute and the same amount of dollars as you were a year ago.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For all its focus on reasoning, one thing that’s absent from today’s launch is a new image generator. Altman reportedly said in his code red memo that image generation would be a key priority moving forward, particularly after Google’s Nano Banana (the nickname for Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model) had a viral moment following its August release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, Google launched Nano Banana Pro (aka Gemini 3 Pro Image), an upgraded version with even better text rendering, world knowledge, and an<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/googles-nano-banana-pro-makes-ultrarealistic-ai-images-it-scares-the-hell-out-of-me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> eerie, real-life, unedited vibe</a> to its photos. It also integrates better across Google’s products, as demonstrated over the past week as it pops up in tools and workflows like Google Labs Mixboard for automated presentation generation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI reportedly plans to release another new model in January with better images, improved speed, and better personality, though the company didn’t confirm these plans Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI also said Thursday it’s rolling out new safety measures around mental health use and age verification for teens, but didn’t spend much of the launch pitching those changes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated with more information about OpenAI’s compute efficiency status. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

Beyond the AI assistant, the company detailed how it has developed a software and new hardware, including a custom 5nm processor built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC, that will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expand its hands-free driving assistance system</a> and eventually let drivers take their eyes off the road.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This vertical integration work has been underway for years. In 2024, the EV maker completely reworked the guts of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/06/rivian-refresh-r1t-r1s-second-generation-speed-range-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV</a>, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, sensor stack, and software user interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s software team led by Bensaid has continued to work on building out the software stack. A smaller group — the size of which Rivian won’t disclose — focused on the AI assistant, which is designed to be model and platform agnostic, according to Bensaid.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To power this AI assistant, Rivian developed what it has described as a model- and platform-agnostic architecture that uses custom large language models and is branded as Rivian Unified Intelligence, or RUI. This hybrid software stack includes its own custom models and the “orchestration layer,” the conductor that makes sure the various AI models work together. Rivian said it has used other companies for specific agentic AI functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Riven Unified Intelligence is the connective tissue that runs through the very heart of Rivian’s digital ecosystem,” Bensaid said at the event. “This platform enables targeted agent solutions that drive value across our entire operation and our entire vehicle life cycle.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, RUI will be used for more than just providing an AI assistant, according to the company. It will also be used to improve vehicle diagnostics, which Rivian describes as “an expert assistant for technicians, scanning telemetry and history to pinpointing complex issues.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>The article was updated to clarify that the AI assistant will be augmented by frontier large language mode</em>ls.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rivian says it will charge a one-time fee of $2,500 or $49.99 per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What that means is you can get into the vehicle at your house, plug in the address to where you’re going, and the vehicle will completely drive you there,” Scaringe said Thursday, describing a point-to-point navigation feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After that, Rivian plans to allow drivers to take their eyes off the road. “This gives you your time back. You can be on your phone, or reading a book, no longer needing to be actively involved in the operation of vehicle.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s driver assistance software won’t stop there; the EV maker laid out plans on Thursday to enhance its capabilities all the way up to what it’s calling “personal L4,” a nod to the level set by the Society of Automotive Engineers that means a car can operate in a particular area with no human intervention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After that, Scaringe hinted that Rivian will be looking at competing with the likes of Waymo. “While our initial focus will be on personally owned vehicles, which today represent a vast majority of the miles driven in the United States, this also enables us to pursue opportunities in the ride-share space,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To help accomplish these lofty goals, Rivian has been building a “large driving model” (think: an LLM but for real-world driving), part of a move away from a rules-based framework for developing autonomous vehicles that has been led by Tesla. The company also showed off its own custom 5nm processor, which it says will be built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That custom chip powers what Rivian is referring to as its third-generation “autonomy computer,” or ACM3. The new computer can process 5 billion pixels per second and will start showing up on Rivian’s upcoming mass-market R2 SUV in late 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian will couple the ACM3 with a lidar sensor at the top of the windshield (from an undisclosed supplier) to provide “three-dimensional spatial data and redundant sensing,” which it says will help with “real-time detection for the edge cases of driving.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect that at launch in late 2026 this will be the most powerful combination of sensors and inference compute in consumer vehicles in North America,” senior vice president of electrical hardware Vidya Rajagopalan said at the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The R2 is set to start shipping in the first half of 2026, meaning the launch versions of the SUV will not have ACM3 or the lidar sensor. That means early versions of the R2 without the ACM3 and lidar hardware will most likely plateau at hands-free driving. Anyone hoping to do eyes-off or, later, unsupervised driving in a Rivian will need a vehicle with a lidar sensor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Adding lidar creates the ultimate sensing combination. It gives the most comprehensive 3D model of the space the vehicle is traveling through,” vice president of autonomy and AI James Philbin said Thursday. “The goal for our onboard sensing stack isn’t just human level, it’s superhuman level.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to reflect that Rivian will not offer eyes-off driving in vehicles without lidar sensors. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Dubbed GWM-1, the model works through frame-by-frame prediction, creating a simulation with an understanding of physics and how the world actually behaves over time, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A world model is an AI system that learns an internal simulation of how the world works so it can reason, plan, and act without needing to be trained on every scenario possible in real life. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Runway, which earlier this month launched its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/01/runway-gen-4-5-video-model-google-open-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gen 4.5 video model</a> that surpassed both Google and OpenAI on the Video Arena leaderboard, said its GWM-1 world model is more “general” than Google’s Genie-3 and other competitors. The firm is pitching it as a model that can create simulations to train agents in different domains like robotics and life sciences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To build a world model, we first needed to build a really great video model. We believe that the right path to building a world model is teaching models to predict pixels directly is the best way to achieve general-purpose simulation. At sufficient scale and with the right data, you can build a model that has sufficient understanding of how the world works,” the company’s CTO, Anastasis Germanidis, said during the livestream.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Runway released specific slants or versions to the new world model called GWM-Worlds, GWM-Robotics, and GWM-Avatars.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075175\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png 2752w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=1200,670 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=1280,714 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=430,240 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=720,402 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=900,502 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=800,447 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=1536,857 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=2048,1143 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=668,373 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=1105,617 1105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=708,395 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Worlds.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Runway</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GWM-Worlds is an app for the model that lets you create an interactive project. Users can set a scene through a prompt or an image reference, and as you explore the space, the model generates the world with an understanding of geometry, physics, and lighting. The company mentioned that the simulation runs at 24 fps and 720p resolution. Runway said that while Worlds could be useful for gaming, it’s also well-positioned to teach agents how to navigate and behave in the physical world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With GWM-Robotics, the company aims to use synthetic data enriched with new parameters like changing  weather conditions or obstacles. Runway says this method could also reveal when and how robots might violate policies and instructions in different scenarios.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Runway is also building realistic avatars under GWM-Avatars to simulate human behavior. Companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/d-id-acquires-berlin-based-video-startup-simpleshow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">D-ID</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/synthesia-snaps-up-180m-on-a-2-1b-valuation-for-its-b2b-ai-video-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Synthesia</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/are-lifelike-digital-humans-the-future-of-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Soul Machines</a>, and even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/google-vids-adds-ai-avatars-to-its-video-editor-and-launches-a-consumer-version/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a> have worked on creating human avatars that look real and work in areas like communication and training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company noted that technically Worlds, Robotics, and Avatars are separate models, but eventually it plans to merge all these into one model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides releasing a new world model, the company is also updating its foundational <a href=\"https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-gen-4.5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gen 4.5 model released earlier in the month</a>. The new update brings native audio and long-form, multi-shot generation capabilities to the model. The company said that with this model, users can generate one-minute videos with character consistency, native dialogue, background audio, and complex shots from various angles. The company said that you can also edit existing audio and add dialogues. Plus, you can edit multi-shot videos of any length.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Gen 4.5 update nudges Runway closer to competitor Kling’s all-in-one video suite, which <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kling-ai-launches-video-2-6-model-with-simultaneous-audio-visual-generation-capability-redefining-ai-video-creation-workflow-302634067.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also launched earlier this month</a>, particularly around native audio and multi-shot storytelling. It also signals that video generation models are moving from prototype to production-ready tools.
