Remote workers, who miss the everyday interactions found in an office, and younger individuals eager to create their adult social circles based on shared interests and hobbies, are among those seeking meaningful friendships.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thanks to online dating apps, the stigma associated with finding connections online has largely faded away. This has welcomed a new wave of apps focused on fostering friendships and building local communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to estimates from Appfigures, over a dozen local-focused friendship apps have collectively generated approximately $16 million in consumer spending in the U.S. so far this year. Some notable examples include Timeleft, Meet5, and Bumble’s BFF. Additionally, these apps have garnered approximately 4.3 million downloads thus far in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The apps aim to provide a less awkward solution than, for instance, approaching a stranger at the gym or local café and trying to strike up a conversation. These platforms clearly indicate that everyone using the app is looking for the same thing — friendship, not romance — making it much less intimidating to initiate conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From major players like Meetup to newer ones like 222, there are plenty of apps that cater to the growing demand for meaningful friendships. We’ve compiled a list of them for you to try out.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-222\">222</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3050909\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png 1685w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=1200,777 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=1280,829 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=430,278 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=720,466 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=900,583 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=800,518 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=1536,995 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=668,433 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=579,375 579w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=953,617 953w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=708,458 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>222 (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app <a href=\"https://222.place/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">222</a> is an <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/222-find-your-people/id6450612690\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iOS-only</a> social events platform that facilitates in-person meetups by pairing a group of strangers based on their personality test results. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/2440702/\">The app</a> sends invitations to nearby public social events, such as wine bars and comedy clubs.

Last year, some investors thought the IPO market would be back up and running by now (which didn’t quite happen), while others thought the momentum behind AI was poised to accelerate (and they were right). This year, TechCrunch did the same thing, talking to five investors from various markets about what they are preparing for in 2026.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here is what they said.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-will-it-take-for-a-founder-to-raise-next-year-compared-to-last-year\"><strong>What will it take for a founder to raise next year, compared to last year? </strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/motown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>James Norman</strong></a><strong>, Managing Partner, Black Ops VC</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raising in 2025 requires a shift from ‘visionary’ to ‘battle-tested.’ In previous years, capital has been a primary moat; now, investors are wary of ‘pilot purgatory,’ when enterprises test AI solutions without an urgent need to buy. In 2026, the bar is rising. Founders must prove to VCs they have more than just traction; they need a distribution advantage. Investors are digging deeper into repeatable sales engines, proprietary workflow/processes and deep subject matter expertise that holds up against the  ‘capital arms race’. VCs no longer care about who’s first to market with a flashy demo. They want to know who’s building something that can last, earn trust, and scale long-term. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-blumberg-6a55937a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>Morgan Blumberg</strong></a><strong>, Principal, M13</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We believe the funding markets will always be available for the best founders, but the bar will rise. At the earliest stages, especially in AI application software, I do expect fewer mega seed rounds given intense competition and capital already deployed across many categories. Founders will need to stand out with unique distribution channels or perspectives, not just by relying on a large market opportunity and strong backgrounds. Capital moats have already formed around crowded sectors. At the Series-A and B stages, top-quartile rounds will require clear evidence of explosive momentum. The market has now adjusted to these expectations with increased scrutiny on the sustainability of revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aktaylor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>Allen Taylor</strong></a><strong>, Managing Partner, Endeavor Catalyst </strong> </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bigger, faster, better: bigger total addressable market, faster growth, better unit economics. We made 50 investments last year across 25 countries, and we expect to do more this year, so we’re seeing founders at very different stages and in very different markets. The strongest founders aren’t just showing what they’ve built so far — they’re helping investors understand where the business is going next. Real revenue and real customers still matter, but they’re not sufficient on their own. As an investor, I’m always asking: Where is this company today, and where could it realistically be in the next 12, 18, or 24 months? The founders who raise are the ones who can answer that question clearly and credibly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorothyjean/\">Dorothy Chang</a>, Partner, Flybridge Capital </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A lot of founders are finding it easy to build new things because genAI coding tools are so advanced today. But in truth, those tools are leveling the playing field for everyone, and competition is more fierce than ever. So founders building for venture scale need to make sure that they are: 1) truly tackling a big idea, not just something that’s easy to vibe code, 2) building in a problem area that they are uniquely positioned to win, and 3) bringing something proprietary that can’t easily be replicated. This could be a contrarian approach with unique insights, proprietary access to data, deep networks/relationships, a technological advantage, etc. These aren’t new concepts, but the stakes and expectations are higher than ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/dawn-capitals-shamillah-bankiya-breaks-down-the-state-of-the-euro-venture-market/\">Shamillah Bankiya</a>, Partner, Dawn Capital </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For founders selling to enterprises, I think the entire world has gotten smarter on the value that AI can deliver, and as such, proving — showing line of sight to ROI — will be more important than ever to investors. Founders who can prove that their products offer much higher value have the best shot at raising capital.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-areas-are-you-looking-to-invest-in-and-why-nbsp\"><strong>What areas are you looking to invest in and why?</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a fund, we remain industry-agnostic generalists, but we are always sharpening our lens. Today we’re looking for ‘high-context founders.’ In a world where AI has commoditized the ability to write code, the winning edge is now lived experience. We want to invest in the founder who has spent years in the trenches of a complex industry and possesses the bespoke expertise that can be 10x’d by AI. For us, the ideal investment is a marriage of deep subject matter expertise and a ‘day zero’ distribution advantage, meaning founders don’t just know what to build but already know exactly who is going to buy it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are particularly interested in sleepy or legacy industries that sit outside core tech founder appetite, where AI can offer step change ROI that drives adoption. These markets have lower competition and moats driven by complexity that often come with less obvious sectors. We also believe 2026 will be a great year for infrastructure supporting foundational model development, as well as frontier research categories like embodied AI and world models. Healthcare remains a major focus given clear signs of buyer demand; we focus on systems of record and platforms rather than point solutions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside the United States! The best risk-adjusted venture returns are not in Silicon Valley anymore. They are in markets like Poland, Turkey, and Greece. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you invest across 25 countries in a single year, you stop thinking of venture as something that happens in one place and then spreads outward. Twenty years ago, roughly 90% of venture dollars went to the United States. That flipped in 2018. Today, more than half of venture investment — and more than half of the world’s unicorns — are outside the U.S.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We see this every day. Founders in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia are building venture-scale companies — often serving massive markets from the start. In our pipeline, it’s normal to see founders from Venezuela building in Iraq, or from Sudan building global businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Chang</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m most interested in founders who are tackling massive problems and leveraging technology for forward progress. I’m rather unmoved by the plethora of startups focused on agentically automating workflows for specific verticals. I’m much more interested in the larger platform shifts that will define this era of technological and societal progress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Bankiya </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve seen tremendous impact on software from AI. I think the next frontier is at the intersection of software and hardware. Most of the world’s GDP is locked up in physical industries, and software-only solutions aren’t enough to fully unlock the world’s growth potential.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-think-the-ipo-market-will-thaw-why-or-why-not-nbsp\"><strong>Do you think the IPO market will thaw? Why or why not?</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, the IPO market is likely to thaw, not because conditions are suddenly ideal, but because the system is running out of viable alternatives. We’re approaching a tipping point where the private market’s ability to sustain multi-billion-dollar valuations, often disconnected from profitability or liquidity, is wearing thin. Years of “paper markups” have postponed reality, but they haven’t eliminated it. Companies, boards, and late-stage investors increasingly need a mechanism to reset expectations, generate real liquidity, and re-establish price discovery.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Private credit has acted as a stopgap, extending runways without forcing valuation discipline. But that bridge is starting to look more like a pressure cooker. Debt can delay decisions, not solve structural capital needs, especially for companies built for equity-style growth. At some point, fresh capital becomes necessary, and public markets remain the only place capable of providing it at scale. Their growth narratives and strategic importance can provide the “air cover” needed to reopen the IPO window. Once investors re-engage around category-defining leaders, it creates permission for the broader high-growth software sector to follow. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think we will see a reopening of the IPO markets driven by the backlog of companies planning to list. Many large tech IPOs are anticipated, including darlings like Anthropic and OpenAI, and I believe one of these mega IPOs will drive considerable momentum for others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. 2026 will be a big year for IPOs in New York as dozens of the top companies simply decide “it’s time.” It will also be a banner year for tech IPOs in places folks are not used to seeing them — like the stock market in Saudi Arabia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think people underestimate how global the thaw will be. We’ve had nearly four years of muted IPO activity, which has created a backlog of high-quality companies that are ready to be public. When the window opens, it won’t just be U.S. companies stepping through it. There’s already a cohort of major U.S.-listed technology companies from Latin America, including MercadoLibre and Nubank, and there’s another wave right behind them that public-market investors haven’t fully priced in yet. I don’t think all of those companies list in 2026, but several will. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s even more unexpected is what happens locally. You’re going to see meaningful technology IPOs in places like Saudi Arabia, listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). When companies like Tabby [a buy-now-pay-later outfit] go public locally, it will challenge assumptions about where global tech outcomes happen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Chang </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re looking to make slightly fewer, more concentrated bets. There is a ton of startup activity, so when we meet founders who really stand out, we want to be able to back up our high conviction with a higher check size and higher ownership percentage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bankyia</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think a hard catalyst would be required to reset the IPO markets — something akin to mega AI players facing unprecedented cost increases or sharp revenue declines. Think, for example, of energy prices sharply rising, such that it’s unaffordable to offer compute for AI training and inference.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-are-you-looking-at-the-venture-market-for-next-year-as-a-fund-nbsp-manager-nbsp\"><strong>How are you looking at the venture market for next year as a fund manager?</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re entering what I’d describe as a clearing event for the venture market, and next year will separate durable platforms from transient ones. The fallout will hit Fund I managers who haven’t found their footing, and active Fund II managers struggling with a [distributions-paid-in-capital, or DPI] drought from 2021 vintages. Traditional institutional anchors, particularly university endowments, are effectively in repair mode. After being squeezed by the absence of liquidity in 2021 and 2022, many are leaning on secondaries, pacing adjustments, and portfolio-smoothing strategies just to maintain existing commitments.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means fewer new relationships and far less tolerance for emerging or undifferentiated managers. Stepping into their place are family offices that have moved from passive LP roles to active market forces. They aren’t just filling the ‘LP oxygen’ left by retreating institutions; they are scoping direct mandates and using [registered investment advisors]  to hunt for unique, high-conviction strategies.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2026, there is no viable middle ground. You need to have a clinical, defensible track record and/or truly unfair access to differentiated deal flow. Lightly grounded generalist positioning, soft networks, and “good enough” performance won’t survive this cycle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We believe we are in the early innings of AI transformation, so we expect next year to be a strong vintage. Capital continues to concentrate in a select number of winners so we focus on being selective and operationally supporting our companies to earn our right to concentrate. We are advising our portfolio companies to strengthen their balance sheets in case of a downturn in 2026 while focusing on building for the long term rather than optimizing for fast funding. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazing time to back the boldest founders building for the next 10+ years! From a fund manager’s perspective, 2026 looks strong on both deployment and liquidity. Last year we had 12 liquidity events — all through M&amp;A and secondaries. That matters because venture has grown dramatically over the last two decades, while paths to liquidity didn’t keep pace. What’s changing now is that venture is building a more complete liquidity toolkit — M&amp;A, secondaries, and IPOs working together.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s critical when founders are committing 10, 15, even 20 years to building companies. At the same time, we’re seeing real structural shifts in core sectors. Financial technology, especially stablecoins, moved from experimentation to mainstream adoption in 2025, particularly in markets like Latin America and Africa. In those places, this isn’t speculative technology; it’s infrastructure. That combination is why 2026 looks like a strong year to be deploying capital. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bankyia</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re still searching for phenomenal European founders building groundbreaking companies. Great companies are formed in all cycles.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-will-happen-to-all-the-nbsp-investor-nbsp-and-nbsp-startup-interest-nbsp-in-ai-next-year-nbsp\"><strong>What will happen to all the investor and startup interest in AI next year?</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2026, the ‘AI curiosity’ that fueled the last two years is being replaced by a demand for application and scale. We are moving from the era of building models to the era of building businesses. The fastest, most innovative companies aren’t the ones with the largest LLMs, they are the ones using AI to solve high-value, domain-specific problems that were previously too complex or too manual to scale. Investors aren’t looking for ‘AI startups’ anymore; we’re looking for exceptional tech founders who have found a way to use this intelligence to 10x the efficiency of a massive, traditional market. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We expect investor and startup interest to continue at all-time highs. However, I do think we will start to see tuck-in acquisitions, acquihires and wind-downs in highly concentrated sectors such as coding automation, sales automation, marketing and advertising as market share starts to concentrate in select assets.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It will continue. But by the end of 2026, I predict AI will stop being a separate category as it will just be a part of all new technology companies being built.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a lot of breathless talk about AI right now — and that’s understandable. We’re still very early in understanding what this technology will actually change. In moments like this, excitement tends to run ahead of clarity. Some companies will be transformational, many won’t, and pricing will take time to adjust as real use cases emerge. The opportunity isn’t in labeling everything as “AI.” It’s in understanding where AI meaningfully changes cost structures, speed, or decision-making inside real businesses. That’s where durable value gets created. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is one of those moments when the fog is thick, and that’s when outcomes diverge the most. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Chang </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I don’t see it slowing down anytime soon. We’ve seen a lot of dollars go into infrastructure and theory; this year we’ll see a lot more of that investment more clearly turn into enterprise value at the application level.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bankyia</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI will remain a hot topic, barring negative hard catalysts that dramatically change conditions, like an energy crisis or a rise in default rates.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-something-unexpected-that-could-happen-in-2026-in-the-world-of-venture-and-startups-nbsp\"><strong>What is something unexpected that could happen in 2026 in the world of venture and startups?</strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the most unexpected shifts of 2026 will be the quiet end of the “ChatGPT-first” era in startups. Not because generative AI loses importance, but because no single model remains the default starting point. GPT is no longer consistently best-in-class for search, image generation, or video, which fundamentally changes how tech companies architect their products. The savvy founders in 2026 have already graduated to a multi-model world, and instead their focus has shifted to specialization.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, Anthropic has effectively captured the developer’s mindshare because Claude Code is better at building with you, and Google has finally activated its structural advantages. With Gemini 3, it’s pairing top-tier image and video generation with deep multimodal capability and native access to Google’s search and data ecosystem. That combination is proving hard to compete with. Model choice becomes an infrastructure decision, not a moat. The winners in 2026 won’t be the companies that “use GPT,” but the ones that orchestrate multiple models seamlessly, abstract complexity away from users, and build proprietary workflows on top. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We expect to see many successful startups built with only one or two rounds of capital. AI tooling (especially coding automation) enables many early-stage companies to accomplish profitability without excessive burn. From a technology perspective, while LLMs are expected to be everywhere, companies will start to scale back usage in favor of more controlled use as enterprises prioritize explainability, cost and reliability. This could drive heavier use of small models, deterministic and probabilistic hybrid models, world models, or simulation modeling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end of the Russia-Ukraine war will bring about a renaissance of investing in Ukrainian founders, who are some of the best in the world! Two additional things will genuinely surprise people. First, international companies — especially from Latin America — going public in New York at scale. Second, major technology IPOs coming out of the Middle East, listed locally. When companies like Tabby go public on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), it will reset expectations about where global tech leadership lives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Finding a chemical-free way to kill weeds seemed like a solid option.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the laser was a dead end. There’s too much risk of starting a fire, he told TechCrunch in an interview. After a lot of trial and error prototyping with ideas like cryogenics, the solution he settled on — which he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/startup-battlefield/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">showed off </a>earlier this year at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-disrupt-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a> — is steam.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boysen’s company has developed a system that uses computer vision to spot weeds in lawns and fields and golf courses, and kill them with nothing but vaporized water. It can be attached to mowers, or tractors, or even ATVs. At the moment, Naware is flexible, and Boysen is visibly eager for his idea to spread fast — much like the weeds he’s trying to kill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a world of agentic AI and billion-dollar software companies, Naware stands out as a classic garage startup story. Boysen said his team first tested the use of steam by ordering a “rinky dink” garment steamer off of Amazon. After that, they ordered seven more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re not real industrial,” Boysen said. “And so there’s a lot of research helping to develop that, to get to the point of: ‘How do we make this effective and make it repeatable so it can scale?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developing the steamer tech was one challenge, but the bigger one may have been identifying the weeds, Boysen said. It’s well-established that artificial intelligence software can be trained to accurately recognize objects or patterns, but the “green-on-green” problem was tough, he said — especially because the software has to recognize the weeds in real time while the rig is prowling over a lawn. (And yes, it’s using Nvidia GPUs.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He thinks they’ve gotten there, though. He said Naware is targeting companies that do lawn care for athletic fields and golf courses, and claims his company can save customers like that “anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000 on chemicals alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, he said customers will save money by not having to pay for people whose only job is to spray those chemicals. Naware has been doing paid pilots to test and dial in the product, but Boysen’s pitch has already attracted prospective partners, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re going after the strategic partnerships. We’re in discussions with $5 billion companies that do equipment manufacturing that are interested in our product. And we’re a couple conversations into that — I can’t say their name, but you’ll figure it out,” he laughed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Success, Boysen said, will take three things: those partnerships, securing patents, and funding. Boysen has been bootstrapping Naware for now but said he’ll open its first fundraising round in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve got to get a funding round that just crushes anybody else trying to think about it,” he said. “I’ve got to deliver the promise that I can kill weeds, and it’s effective. And we’ll make it work. I’m not concerned about that.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In short, if you turn your head, the virtual screen stays in place rather than moving with you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They feature a built-in button array that lets you quickly change your screen size, distance, color temperature, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047045\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-its-new-oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-for-athletes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses</a> are the best option for outdoorsy people and athletes, as they were specifically designed with them in mind.

They offer impressive visuals and features for the price and are great for light gaming or watching content on long journeys. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They feature micro‑OLED displays that create a virtual 201‑inch screen at 1080p resolution, with a 120 Hz refresh rate, a 46-degree field of view, and about 650 nits of perceived brightness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the field of view is narrower than some premium models and they don’t have head tracking, they’re a good option for people who simply want an external display on the go without breaking the bank. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The glasses use a micro‑OLED “HueView” display with eye protection features like 3840 Hz hybrid dimming and low blue‑light certification to reduce eye strain during extended use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The RayNeo Air 3s cost $269 (currently on sale for $219). </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-upcoming-launches-to-keep-your-eye-on\">Upcoming launches to keep your eye on</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Project Aura:</strong> Google and Xreal are collaborating <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/googles-first-ai-glasses-expected-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">on a pair of Android XR-powered glasses</a> that are equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology.

There are now dozens of journalists who cover cybersecurity in the English language. There are a lot of stories about cybersecurity, privacy, and surveillance that are published every week. And a lot of them are great, and you should read them. We’re here to recommend the ones we liked the most, so keep in mind that it’s a very subjective and, at the end of the day, incomplete list. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyway, let’s get into it. <em>— Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-shane-harris-described-how-he-cultivated-a-senior-iranian-hacker-as-a-source-who-was-then-killed\">Shane Harris described how he cultivated a senior Iranian hacker as a source, who was then killed</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every once in a while, there’s a hacker story that as soon as you start reading, you think it could be a movie or a TV show. This is the case with <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/01/mohammad-tajik-iran-cyber-intelligence/684954/?gift=kPTlqn0J1iP9IBZcsdI5IUTLJcsVKq12m0EyVlSYJBQ&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shane Harris’ very personal tale of his monthslong correspondence with a top Iranian hacker</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2016, The Atlantic’s journalist made contact with a person claiming to work as a hacker for Iran’s intelligence, where he claimed to have worked on major operations, such as the downing of an American drone and the now-infamous hack against oil giant Saudi Aramco, where Iranian hackers wiped the company’s computers. Harris was rightly skeptical, but as he kept talking to the hacker, who eventually revealed his real name to him, Harris started to believe him. When the hacker died, Harris was able to piece together the real story, which somehow turned out to be more incredible than the hacker had led Harris to believe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The gripping story is also a great behind-the-scenes look at the challenges cybersecurity reporters face when dealing with sources claiming to have great stories to share.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-washington-post-revealed-a-secret-order-demanding-apple-let-u-k-officials-spy-on-users-encrypted-data\">The Washington Post revealed a secret order demanding Apple let U.K. officials spy on users’ encrypted data</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.K. government secretly issued Apple with a court order</a> demanding that the company build a back door so police can access the iCloud data of any customer in the world. Due to a worldwide gag order, it was only because <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\">The Washington Post</a> broke news that we learned the order existed to begin with. The demand was the first of its kind, and — if successful — would be a major defeat for tech giants who have spent the past decade locking themselves out of their users’ own data so they can’t be compelled to provide it to governments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple subsequently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-icloud-end-to-end-encryption-feature-for-uk-users-after-government-demanded-backdoor/\">stopped offering its opt-in end-to-end encrypted cloud storage</a> to its customers in the U.K. in response to the demand. But by breaking the news, the secret order was thrust into the public eye and allowed both Apple and critics to scrutinize U.K. surveillance powers in a way that hasn’t been tested in public before. The story sparked a months-long diplomatic row between the U.K. and the United States, prompting Downing Street to drop the request — only to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/uk-government-tries-again-to-access-encrypted-apple-customer-data-report/\">try again</a> several months later.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans-by-the-atlantic-is-this-year-s-best-headline\">‘The Trump Administration accidentally texted me its war plans’ by The Atlantic is this year’s best headline</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This story was the sort of fly-on-the-wall access that some reporters would dream of, but <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/\">The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief got to play out in real-time</a> after he was unwittingly added to a Signal group of senior U.S. government officials <em>by </em>a senior U.S. government official discussing war plans from their cell phones. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/clean-on-opsec.jpg\" alt='a screenshot from the leaked Signal chat, which reads (from Pete Hegseth): \"MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline) We are currently clean on OPSEC.

The unraveling of the situation ultimately exposed security lapses involving the use of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://micahflee.com/how-the-knock-off-signal-app-used-by-trump-officials-got-hacked-in-20-minutes/\">a knock-off Signal clone</a> that further jeopardized the government’s ostensibly secure communications.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-brian-krebs-tracked-down-a-prolific-hacker-group-admin-as-a-jordanian-teenager\">Brian Krebs tracked down a prolific hacker group admin as a Jordanian teenager</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brian Krebs is one of the more veteran cybersecurity reporters out there, and for years he has specialized in following online breadcrumbs that lead to him revealing the identity of notorious cybercriminals. In this case, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/meet-rey-the-admin-of-scattered-lapsus-hunters/\">Krebs was able to find the real identity behind a hacker’s online handle Rey</a>, who is part of the notorious <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/the-biggest-underestimated-security-threat-of-today-advanced-persistent-teenagers/\">advanced persistent teenagers</a>‘ cybercrime group that calls itself Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Krebs’ quest was so successful that he was able to talk to a person very close to the hacker — we won’t spoil the whole article here — and then the hacker himself, who confessed to his crimes and claimed he was trying to escape the cybercriminal life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Independent media outlet 404 Media has accomplished more impact journalism this year than most mainstream outlets with vastly more resources. One of its biggest wins was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.404media.co/airlines-will-shut-down-program-that-sold-your-flights-records-to-government/\">exposing and effectively shuttering a massive air travel surveillance system</a> tapped by federal agencies and operating in plain sight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">404 Media reported that a little-known data broker set up by the airline industry called the Airlines Reporting Corporation was selling access to five billion plane tickets and travel itineraries, including names and financial details of ordinary Americans, allowing government agencies like ICE, the State Department, and the IRS to track people without a warrant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ARC, owned by United, American, Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, and other airlines, said it would shut down the warrantless data program following <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.404media.co/airlines-sell-5-billion-plane-ticket-records-to-the-government-for-warrantless-searching/\">404 Media’s months-long reporting</a> and intense pressure from lawmakers.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wired-made-the-3d-printed-gun-that-luigi-mangione-allegedly-used-to-kill-a-healthcare-executive-to-test-the-legalities-of-ghost-guns\">Wired made the 3D-printed gun that Luigi Mangione allegedly used to kill a healthcare executive to test the legalities of ‘ghost guns’</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024 was one of the biggest stories of the year. Luigi Mangione, the chief suspect in the killing, was soon after arrested and indicted on charges of using a “ghost gun,” a 3D-printed firearm that had no serial numbers and built in private without a background check — effectively a gun that the government has no idea exists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wired, using its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/06/i-made-an-untraceable-ar-15-ghost-gun/\">past reporting experience on 3D-printed weaponry</a>, sought to test how easy it would be to build a 3D-printed gun, while navigating the patchwork legal (and ethical) landscape.

This story explored the shadowy world of phone surveillance by exploiting Signalling System No. 7, or SS7, an obscurely named protocol long known to allow malicious tracking.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wired-reported-on-the-investigation-behind-a-string-of-swatting-attacks-on-hundreds-of-schools-nationwide\">Wired reported on the investigation behind a string of ‘swatting’ attacks on hundreds of schools nationwide</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swatting has been a problem for years.

Swatting is a type of hoax where someone — often a hacker — calls the emergency services and tricks the authorities into sending an armed SWAT team to the home of the hoaxer’s target, often pretending to be the target themselves, and pretending they are about to commit a violent crime. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this feature, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/school-swatting-torswats-brad-dennis/\">Wired’s Andy Greenberg put a face on the many characters who are part of these stories</a> such as the call operators who have to deal with this problem. And he also profiled a prolific swatter, known as Torswats, who for months tormented the operators and schools all over the country with fake — but extremely believable — threats of violence, as well as a hacker who took it upon himself to track Torswats down. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the challenge of defeating it sparked Quintero’s passion for cybersecurity, eventually leading him to found <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirusTotal\">VirusTotal</a>, a startup that Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/google-acquires-online-virus-malware-and-url-scanner-virustotal/\">acquired</a> in 2012. That acquisition brought Google’s flagship European cybersecurity center to Málaga, transforming the Spanish city into a tech hub.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All because of a small malware program created by someone whose identity Quintero had never known. Moved by nostalgia and gratitude, Quintero launched a search earlier this year. He asked Spanish media outlets to amplify his quest for tips. He dove back into the virus’s code, looking for clues his 18-year-old self might have missed. And he eventually solved the mystery, sharing the bittersweet resolution in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bernardo-quintero-49697b2_hace-una-semana-anunciamos-internamente-que-activity-7333016670971527170-8WP3/\">LinkedIn post</a> that went viral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The story begins in 1992, when a young Quintero was prompted by a teacher to create an antivirus for the 2610-byte program that had spread across the computers of Málaga’s Polytechnic School. “That challenge in my first year at university sparked a deep interest in computer viruses and security, and without it my path might have been very different,” Quintero told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quintero’s search was aided by his programmer instincts. Earlier this year, he <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bernardo-quintero-49697b2_hace-una-semana-anunciamos-internamente-que-activity-7333016670971527170-8WP3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\">stepped down</a> from his team manager role to “go back to the cave, to the basement of Google.” He didn’t leave the company; instead, he went back to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.diariosur.es/tecnologia/sotano-google-bernardo-quintero-equipo-veinteaneros-cocinan-20250912124931-nt.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\">tinkering and experimenting</a> without managerial duties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That tinkering mindset also led him to reexamine Virus Málaga and look for details he’d missed years earlier. First, he found fragments of a signature, but thanks to another security expert, he discovered a later variant of the virus with a much clearer cue: “KIKESOYYO.” “Kike soy yo” would translate to “I am Kike,” a common nickname for “Enrique.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around the same time, Quintero received a direct message from a man who is now the general digital transformation coordinator for the Spanish city of Cordoba and who claimed he witnessed one of his Polytechnic School classmates create the virus. Many details added up, but one stood out in particular: the man knew that the virus’s hidden message — called a payload, in cybersecurity terms — was a statement condemning the Basque terrorist group ETA, a fact that Quintero had never disclosed.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tipster then gave Quintero a name — Antonio Astorga — but also shared the news that he had passed away. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This hit Quintero like a ton of bricks; now, he would never be able to ask Antonio about “Kike.” But he kept following the thread, and the plot twist came from Antonio’s sister, who revealed that his first name was actually Antonio Enrique. To his family, he was Kike.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cancer took away Antonio Enrique Astorga before Quintero could thank him in person, but the story doesn’t stop here. Quintero’s LinkedIn post sheds new light to the legacy of “a brilliant colleague who deserves to be recognized as a pioneer of cybersecurity in Málaga” — and not just for helping Quintero discover his vocation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to his friend, Astorga’s virus had no other goal than spreading his anti-terrorist message and proving himself as a programmer. Mirroring Quintero’s path, Astorga’s interest in IT endured, and he became a computing teacher at a secondary school that named its IT classroom after him in his memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Astorga’s legacy also lives on beyond these walls, and not just through his students. One of his sons, Sergio, is a recent software engineering graduate with an interest in cybersecurity and quantum computing — a meaningful connection for Quintero. “Being able to close that circle now, and to see new generations building on it, is deeply meaningful to me,” Quintero said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Quintero, who suspects their paths will cross again, Sergio is “very representative of the talent being formed in Málaga today.” This, in turn, is a result of VirusTotal forming the root of what eventually <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/new-cybersecurity-center-in-malaga/\">became the Google Safety Engineering Center</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://safety.google/intl/en/safety/engineering-center/malaga/\">GSEC</a>) and spearheading collaborations with the University of Málaga that made the city a true cybersecurity talent hub.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Long the invisible but critical backbone of the internet, server farms have rarely been a point of interest for folks outside of the tech industry, let alone an issue of particularly captivating political resonance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, as of 2025, it would appear those days are officially over. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past 12 months, data centers have inspired protests in dozens of states, as regional activists have sought to combat America’s ever-increasing compute buildup. Data Center Watch, an organization tracking anti-data center activism, <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">writes that</a> there are currently 142 different activist groups across 24 states that are organizing against data center developments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activists have a variety of concerns: the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/\">environmental</a> and potential <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/data-center-boom-risks-health-of-already-vulnerable-communities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">health impacts</a> of these projects, the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91444129/data-centers-surge-ai-boom-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">controversial ways</a> in which AI is being used, and, most importantly, the fact that so many new additions to America’s power grid may be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\">driving up local electricity bills</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such a sudden populist uprising appears to be a natural response to an industry that has grown so quickly that it’s now showing up in people’s backyards. Indeed, as the AI industry has swelled to dizzying heights, so, too, has the cloud computing business. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/look-forward/data-center-frontiers/data-center-risk-if-ai-promises-fade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shows that</a>, since 2021, construction spending on data centers has skyrocketed a stunning 331%. Spending on these projects totals in the hundreds of billions of dollars. So many new data centers have been proposed in recent months that many experts believe that a majority of them will not — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/a-fraction-of-proposed-data-centers-will-get-built-utilities-are-wising-up/748214/\">and, indeed, could not possibly</a> — be built.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This buildout shows no signs of slowing down in the meantime. Major tech giants — including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/31/tech-ai-google-meta-amazon-microsoft-spend.html#:~:text=As%20big%20as%20the%20spending,Inside%20India\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">all announced</a> significant capital expenditure projections for the new year, a majority of which will likely go toward such projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New AI infrastructure isn’t just being pushed by Silicon Valley but by Washington, D.C., where the Trump administration has made artificial intelligence a central plank of its agenda. The Stargate Project, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">announced</a> in January, set the stage for 2025’s massive AI infrastructure buildout by <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">heralding a supposed</a> “re-industrialization of the United States.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the process of scaling itself exponentially, an industry that once had little public exposure has suddenly been thrust into the limelight — and is now suffering backlash. Danny Cendejas, an activist with the nonprofit MediaJustice, has been personally involved in a number of actions against data centers, including a protest that took place in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year, where locals came out to decry the <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/how-mediajustice-is-leading-communities-to-push-back-against-ai-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expansion of Colossus</a>, a project from Elon Musk’s startup, xAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cendejas told TechCrunch that he meets new people every week who express interest in organizing against a data center in their community. “I don’t think this is going to stop anytime soon,” he said. “I think it’s going to keep building, and we’re going to see more wins — more projects are going to be stopped.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Evidence in support of Cendejas’ assessment is everywhere you look. Across the country, communities have reacted to newly announced server farms in much the same way the average person might react to the presence of a highly contagious plague. In Michigan, for instance, where developers are currently <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/12/at-least-16-sites-eyed-for-data-centers-in-michigan-amid-ai-boom-heres-where.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eyeing 16 different locations</a> for potential data center construction, protesters recently descended upon the state’s capitol, <a href=\"https://www.wilx.com/2025/12/16/data-center-protest-outside-michigan-capitol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">saying things like</a>: “Michiganders do not want data centers in our yards, in our communities.” Meanwhile, in Wisconsin — another development hot spot — angry locals appear to have recently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/25/microsoft-ai-data-center-rejection-vs-support.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dissuaded Microsoft</a> from using their town as a headquarters for a new 244-acre data center. In Southern California, the tiny city of Imperial Valley recently <a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/environment/2025/12/12/imperial-valley-city-sues-to-force-environmental-review-of-massive-data-center-project\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a lawsuit</a> to overturn its county’s approval of a data center project, expressing environmental concerns as the rationale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The discontent surrounding these projects has gotten so intense that politicians believe it could make or break particular candidates at the ballot box. In November, it was reported that rising electricity costs — which many believe are being driven by the AI boom — could become <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2026-election-utility-bills-ai-data-centers-13703f61d1397612fd067e69b9093116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a critical issue</a> that determines the 2026 midterm elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The whole connection to everybody’s energy bills going up — I think that’s what’s really made this an issue that is so stark for people,” Cendejas told TechCrunch. “So many of us are struggling month to month. Meanwhile, there’s this huge expansion of data centers…[People are wondering] Where is all that money coming from? How are our local governments giving away subsidies and public funds to incentivize these projects, when there’s so much need in our communities?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some cases, protests appear to be working and even halting (if only temporarily) planned developments. Data Center Watch <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims that</a> some $64 billion worth of developments have been blocked or delayed as the result of grassroots opposition. Cendejas is certainly a believer in the idea that organized action can halt companies in their tracks. “All this public pressure is working,” he said, noting that he could sense a “very palpable anger” around the issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, the tech industry is fighting back. Earlier this month, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/data-centers-have-a-political-problem-and-big-tech-wants-to-fix-it-00693695\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a> a relatively new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has been “distributing talking points to members of Congress and organizing local data center field trips to better pitch voters on their value.” Tech companies, including Meta, have been taking out ad campaigns to sell voters on the economic benefits of data centers, the outlet wrote. In short: The tech industry’s AI hopes are pegged to a compute buildout of epic proportions, so for now it’s safe to say that in 2026 the server surge will continue, as will the backlash and polarization that surround it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the actual data on the state of the region’s venture market shows a different reality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upshot: The European market has not recovered from the global venture capital reset that occurred in 2022 and 2023. But there is evidence it is on the cusp of a turnaround, including Klarna’s recent exit and the region’s homegrown AI startups garnering attention from local investors and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors poured €43.7 billion ($52.3 billion) into European startups in 2025 across 7,743 deals through the third quarter, according to PitchBook data. That means the yearly total is on pace to match — not exceed — the €62.1 billion invested in 2024 and €62.3 billion in 2023. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, U.S. venture deal volume in 2025 had already surpassed 2022, 2023, and 2024 by the end of the third quarter, according to PitchBook data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deal recovery isn’t Europe’s biggest problem, though — it’s VC firm fundraising. Through Q3 2025, European VC firms raised a mere €8.3 billion ($9.7 billion), which puts Europe on track for its lowest overall fundraising yearly total in a decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fundraising, LP to GP, is definitely the weakest area within Europe,” Navina Rajan, a senior analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “We’re on track for around 50% to 60% decline in the first nine months of this year. A lot of that is made up now by emerging managers versus experienced firms, and the mega funds that closed last year haven’t repeated this year.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Rajan doesn’t share the same fever that oozed out of attendees at Slush, she pointed to a few positive data points that suggest the European market is turning around.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, the participation of U.S. investors in European startup deals is back on the rise. Rajan said that figure dipped to a low in 2023 when U.S.-based VCs participated in just 19% of European venture deals. It has been steadily on the rise since, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They seem pretty optimistic on the European market,” Rajan said. “Just from an entry point of view, because you think about valuations, especially within AI tech and in the U.S., it’s just impossible to get in now, whereas, if you’re in Europe and your multiples are lower, and you’re new as an investor, it just provides a better entry point for perhaps similar tech.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable is one example of this shift. Vibe-coding companies have raised a lot of VC money in the United States. But U.S. investors also clearly love Lovable. The company just announced a new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/vibe-coding-startup-lovable-raises-330m-at-a-6-6b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$330 million Series B round</a> that was both led by and participated in by a slew of U.S.-based VCs, including Salesforce Ventures, CapitalG, and Menlo Ventures, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">French AI research lab Mistral has seen similar love from U.S.-based firms. <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-raises-1-7-b-to-accelerate-technological-progress-with-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mistral landed a €1.7 billion Series C round</a> in September that included Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, and Lightspeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Klarna’s recent exit also suggests a turnaround is underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swedish fintech giant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/klarnas-ipo-pops-raising-1-4b-with-sequoia-as-the-biggest-winner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Klarna went public</a> in September after raising $6.2 billion across two decades in the private market. That exit likely recycled some capital back to European LPs or gave them confidence in a changing exit environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Victor Englesson, a partner at Swedish EQT, the recent European success stories, like Klarna, have started to change how founders in Europe approach building their companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ambitious founders have seen what great looks like in companies like Spotify, Klarna, Revolut and are now starting companies with that type of ambition,” Englesson told TechCrunch. They’re not starting companies with like, I want to win in Europe, or I want to win in Germany. They start companies with a mindset that I want to win globally. I don’t think we have seen that to the same extent before.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That mindset has EQT, and others, bullish on Europe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For EQT, we’ve invested $120 billion in Europe [over the] last five years,” Englesson said. “We’re going to invest $250 billion [over the] next five years in Europe. So we are extremely committed to Europe.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That should have allowed the robotaxis to operate normally in spite of the massive outage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, many of the vehicles requested a “confirmation check” from Waymo’s <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fleet response team</a> to make sure what they were doing was correct. All Waymo robotaxis have the ability to make these confirmation checks. With such a widespread outage on Saturday, there was a “concentrated spike” in these confirmation requests, Waymo said, which helped create all the congestion caught on video.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said it built this confirmation request system “out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment” but that it is now refining it to “match our current scale.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the [self-driving software] with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,” the company wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software update will add “even more context about regional outages” to the company’s self-driving software. Waymo also said it will improve its emergency response protocols by “incorporating lessons from this event.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a lot of focus has been placed on the instances where Waymo’s robotaxis got stuck during the power outage, the company shared that its vehicles “successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology,” the company wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saturday’s mess is the latest example of how Waymo is still uncovering unforeseen issues with its software and its approach to designing a reliable fleet of self-driving vehicles. The company already had to ship multiple software updates to make its robotaxis wait for stopped school buses, which prompted a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/waymo-to-issue-software-recall-over-how-robotaxis-behave-around-school-buses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">led to a recall</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Waymo says it has used <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2025/12/demonstrably-safe-ai-for-autonomous-driving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gemini’s “world knowledge”</a> to train its autonomous vehicles to navigate complex, rare, and high-stakes scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: “a friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle” whose primary goal is “to enhance the rider’s experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.” The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the system prompts, when a rider activates the assistant via the in-car screen, Gemini can choose from a set of pre-approved greetings personalized with the rider’s first name. The system can also access contextual data about the rider, like how many Waymo trips they’ve been on. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The prompts currently let Gemini access and control in-car features, like the temperature, lighting and music. Notably absent from the function list are volume control, route changes, seat adjustment, and window control, Wong pointed out. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can’t control, the bot is to reply with “aspirational phrases,” like, “It’s not something I can do yet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, the assistant is directed to maintain a clear distinction between its identity as Gemini the AI bot and the autonomous driving technology (the Waymo Driver). So when replying to a question such as, “How do you see the road?” Gemini shouldn’t say “I use a combination of sensors,” and instead should reply, “The Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors…”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. So if a passenger asks about a video they saw of a Waymo hitting something, the bot is instructed to not answer directly and deflect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Your role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system’s performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,” the prompt reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The in-car assistant is allowed to answer general knowledge questions like about the weather, the height of the Eiffel Tower, what time the local Trader Joe’s closes, and who won the last World Series. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo isn’t the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-is-coming-to-tesla-vehicles-next-week-says-elon-musk/\">Tesla is doing something similar with xAI’s Grok</a>. The two different car assistants serve different functions, however. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The bins will grind and dehydrate waste from the produce department, reducing costly landfill fees while also providing feed for the company’s egg producers. Both trim the company’s overhead and lower its ecological footprint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, Mill’s bins will collect data to help Whole Foods understand what gets wasted and why, helping the grocer further control costs. “Ultimately, our goal is not just to make their waste operations more efficient, but also to move upstream so they actually waste less food,” Rogers said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company started selling food waste bins to households <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/17/nest-co-founder-matt-rogers-new-startup-is-trash/\">a few years ago</a>. As can be expected from a team that made the Nest thermostat, the devices are well designed and — to lean on a Silicon Valley cliché — they can be a delight to use. My kids got a kick out of the bins while testing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/mill-compost-review/\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/mills-redesigned-food-waste-bin-really-is-faster-and-quieter-than-before/\">second generations</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Starting in consumer was very intentional because you build the proof points, you build the data, the brand, loyalty,” Rogers said. Many members of the Whole Foods team were already familiar with Mill when the two companies started talking.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s actually kind of our enterprise sales strategy,” Rogers continued. “We have conversations with senior leadership at our various ideal customers, and if they haven’t had Mill at home yet, we say, ‘Hey, try Mill at home, see what your family thinks.’ It is a surefire way of getting folks excited.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup began having conversations with Whole Foods about a year ago, Rogers said. In the ensuing months, Mill demonstrated the consumer version in some of the chain’s grocery stores. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mill has also developed an AI that uses a range of sensors to determine whether food that enters the bin should still be on the shelf. Minimizing “shrink” — the industry’s term for sales lost through waste or theft — can give grocers an edge in a cutthroat market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advances in large language models have been key, Rogers said. When he and Mill co-founder Harry Tannenbaum were at Nest, it took dozens of engineers and a “Google budget” more than a year to train Nest Cameras to recognize people and packages. With new LLMs, Mill only needed a handful of engineers and far less time to deliver superior results, according to Rogers, who said “AI is a huge enabler.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The use of AI allowed Mill to deliver a commercial version faster, diversifying its customer base and source of revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you are a single channel, single customer business, you’re fragile,” Rogers said. “I grew up at Apple during the iPod era,” he said. “Apple at the time was a single leg business. iPod was like 70% of company revenue. This was why we did the iPhone. Steve [Jobs] pushed us really hard on the iPhone because he was worried that folks like Motorola — who were working on smartphones at the time — would start to eat our lunch on the iPod business and that that would crush us. We needed to build another leg of the stool.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it seems that Mill isn’t finished adding legs to its figurative stool. Rogers said it’s working on building out a municipal business as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re continuing to add more legs to the stool and adding more diversity to the business,” he said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In addition, it would have required the age data be shared with developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A judge, citing First Amendment concerns, blocked the law’s enforcement that was set to take effect in January. The ruling was a win for tech giants and a setback to Texas lawmakers, who said the legal fight will continue. The Texas attorney general’s office noted in a court filing that it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-texas-app-store-age-law-meant-protect-children-2025-12-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plans to appeal</a> the decision, a report from Reuters noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To comply with the coming law, Apple had announced in October a series of new requirements for apps in Texas, which included all users under the age of 18 would have to join a Family Sharing group, where parents or guardians would provide consent for all App Store downloads, app purchases, and in-app transactions. Parents would be able to revoke their consent for an app at any time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple also said its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Declared Age Range API</a>, a technology the company debuted to help it comply with the growing number of age-assurance laws worldwide, would be updated in the months ahead to provide the required age categories for new account users in Texas. Apple had planned to launch new APIs for developers to request parental consent again if their app was significantly updated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple had objected to this law, and similar laws arriving next year in Utah and Louisiana, on the grounds of privacy, not kids’ protection. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we share the goal of strengthening kids’ online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores,” Apple explained in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=btkirlj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a developer announcement</a> earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple on Thursday announced other developer tools for complying with new age-assurance laws will remain available for testing, including its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Declared Age Range API</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/PermissionKit/SignificantAppUpdateTopic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Significant Change API under PermissionKit</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/appstore/ageRatingCode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">New age rating property type in StoreKit</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications/notificationtype\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">App Store Server Notifications</a>. In addition, the Declared Age Range API is still available worldwide across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, and later.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude are prohibited from being distributed via the API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The European Commission this month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/eu-investigating-meta-over-policy-change-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">also launched an investigation</a> into the new policy, raising concerns that it may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling the Authority’s decision “fundamentally flawed,” Meta said WhatsApp’s business API isn’t a route to the market for AI companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. The Italian authority assumes WhatsApp is somehow a defacto app store. The route to market for AI companies are the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform. We will appeal,” Meta said in an emailed statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Note: This story was updated to add Meta’s response to the decision.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While it used to be just a boring animation of Santa’s sleigh and reindeer flying across a map, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/norad-santa-tracker-will-stay-on-even-if-the-government-shuts-down/\">NORAD</a> has added tons of features<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/04/tracking-santa-has-never-been-so-technologically-friendly/\"> since then</a>, such as fun mini-games, videos, stories, and Christmas music.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, NORAD’s Santa Tracker <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/norad-holiday-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">teamed up with OpenAI</a> to introduce new AI-powered features. These include an image generator that transforms your selfie into an animated elf character, a tool for generating toy ideas and converting them into printable coloring book pages, and a fill-in-the-blank storytelling tool that allows families to add names, places, and other details to create a fun holiday story to read aloud.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-destinationlink=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png\" data-event=\"clickable_image\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2460192\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png 1337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=1200,634 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=1280,676 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=900,475 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=800,422 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=668,353 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=1168,617 1168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=708,374 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1337px) 100vw, 1337px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>NORAD</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than a 2D model, the NORAD Santa tracker has a 3D visual depiction of Santa’s journey, as the platform was built on <a href=\"https://cesium.com/blog/2018/12/14/tech-behind-santa-tracker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cesium</a>’s open source 3D mapping library.
