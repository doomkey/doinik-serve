Heck, Radiant itself raised $165 million <a href=\"https://www.radiantnuclear.com/blog/series-c-close/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">just six months ago</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the string of investments, it seems reasonable to ask whether the nuclear world is in a bubble. Investment in the technology has tracked closely with the data center boom. AI requires tremendous amounts of electricity, and tech companies and data center developers have been rushing to secure supplies from sources ranging from nuclear fission to supersonic jet engines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As long as tech companies’ power demands continue to grow, interest in nuclear is likely to remain strong. But there might be a winnowing of the field in the next year or two if startups don’t deliver on their promises, many of which revolve around starting their first reactor next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some startups might be able to buy some time after that. First-of-a-kind reactors can be built by hand, but many nuclear startups are predicated on the idea that mass manufacturing will make fission cost-competitive. They might succeed at reaching criticality but stumble when they try to replicate their designs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of this is to say that Radiant will fall into that category; it may very well succeed. Rather, the company just happens to be the latest in a long list of nuclear startups that have announced eye-popping fundraises in the last few months. Anytime a market gets that frothy, the B-word is bound to pop up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Draper Associates and Boost VC with participation from Ark Venture Fund, Chevron Technology Ventures, Friends &amp; Family Capital, Founders Fund, and others. It values Radiant at more than $1.8 billion. Previous investors include Andreessen Horowitz, DCVC, Giant Ventures, and Union Square Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Radiant is developing a microreactor capable of generating 1 megawatt of electricity that can be delivered via semi. It will be cooled by helium and will have enough TRISO fuel — carbon and ceramic-coated beads of graphite and uranium that are designed to be more resistant to meltdowns — to last five months between refueling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is aiming to replace diesel generators at commercial and military sites. Customers will be able to buy the units outright or subscribe to a power-purchase agreement. When the reactor’s 20-year lifetime is up, the company will haul it away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like many nuclear startups, Radiant is targeting data centers as some of its first customers. The company signed a deal with data center developer Equinix in August to supply 20 of its reactors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, Radiant is building a demonstration reactor at the Idaho National Lab, which it hopes to begin testing in the summer of 2026. Many nuclear startups are on a similar timeline, one set by the Trump administration’s goal of three reactors achieving criticality — the moment when a nuclear reaction is self-sustaining — by July 4, 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Radiant is one of 11 companies selected for that program, which doesn’t provide government grants or loans but instead speeds approval timelines.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is also making this the default model in the Gemini app and AI mode in search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Flash model arrives six months after Google announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/googles-newest-gemini-ai-model-focuses-on-efficiency/\">the Gemini 2.5 Flash mode</a>l, offering significant improvements. On the benchmark, the Gemini 3 Flash model outperforms its predecessor by a significant margin and matches the performance of other frontier models, like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT 5.2, in some measures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, it scored 33.7% without tool use on <a href=\"https://scale.com/leaderboard/humanitys_last_exam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark,</a> which is designed to test expertise across different domains. In comparison, Gemini 3 Pro scored 37.5%, Gemini 2.5 Flash scored 11%, and the newly released GPT-5.2 scored 34.5%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the multimodality and reasoning benchmark MMMU-Pro, the new model outscored all competitors with an 81.2% score. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consumer-rollout\">Consumer rollout</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is making Gemini 3 Flash the default model in the Gemini app globally, replacing Gemini 2.5 Flash. Users can still choose the Pro model from the model picker for math and coding questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new model is good at identifying multimodal content and giving you an answer based on that. For instance, you can upload your pickleball short video and ask for tips; you can try drawing a sketch and have the model guess what you are drawing; or you can upload an audio recording to get analysis or generate a quiz.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also said the model better understands the intent of users’ queries and can generate more visual answers with elements like images and tables.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also use the new model to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/googles-vibe-coding-tool-opal-comes-to-gemini/\">create app prototypes</a> in the Gemini app using prompts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Gemini 3 Pro is now available to everyone in the U.S. for search and more people in the U.S. can access the Nano Banana Pro image model in search, as well.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-enterprise-and-developer-availability\">Enterprise and developer availability</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google noted that companies like JetBrains, Figma, Cursor, Harvey, and Latitude are already using the Gemini 3 Flash model, which is available through Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For developers, the company is making the model available in a preview model through the API and in Antigravity, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">Google’s new coding tool released last month</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said the Gemini 3 Pro scores 78% on the SWE-bench verified coding benchmark, only outperformed by GPT-5.2. It added that the model is ideal for video analysis, data extraction, and visual Q&amp;A, and because of its speed, it is suited for quick and repeatable workflows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?w=544\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076854\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=960,1200 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=1024,1280 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=344,430 344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=576,720 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=720,900 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=640,800 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=534,668 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=300,375 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=494,617 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=425,531 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-swe-bench.jpeg?resize=40,50 40w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Model pricing is $0.50 per 1 million input tokens and $3.00 per 1 million output tokens. This is slightly more expensive than $0.30 per 1 million input tokens and $2.50 per 1 million output tokens of Gemini Flash 2.5. But Google claims that the new model outperforms the Gemini 2.5 Pro model while being three times faster. And, for thinking tasks, it uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro. That means overall, you might save on the number of tokens for certain tasks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?w=544\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076855\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=960,1200 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=1024,1280 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=344,430 344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=576,720 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=720,900 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=640,800 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=534,668 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=300,375 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=494,617 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=425,531 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3-flash-token-efficiency.jpeg?resize=40,50 40w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We really position flash as more of your workhorse model. So if you look at, for example, even the input and output prices at the top of this table, Flash is just a much cheaper offering from an input and output price perspective.

To work, the app matches you with friends from your saved contacts in your phone’s address book — but only if both people have opted in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Contact import has always been the most effective way to find people you know on a social app, but it’s also been poorly implemented or abused by platforms,” the company explained in its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/12-16-2025-find-friends\">announcement</a>. “Even with encryption, phone numbers have been leaked or brute-forced, sold to spammers, or used by platforms for dubious purposes. We weren’t willing to accept that risk, so we developed a fundamentally more secure approach that protects your data.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, social apps in the past often used contact matching as a lead generation tool. That is, if the app found you had friends who were not on its service, it would recommend you “add” them. This would then send the friend an invite via text.

This prevents bad actors from uploading random numbers in order to fish for information about Bluesky users, the company notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early adopters should note that contact matching may take some time, but more people will begin showing up in this screen as more Bluesky users upload their own contacts to be matched. You’ll only be matched with friends if both you and your friend have each other in your respective address books. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’d rather not be found by those you know from work or your real life, you can simply choose not to use the feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky says it stores uploaded contact information in hashed pairs, where your number is combined with each contact’s number. This makes the data harder to reverse engineer, the company claims. The data’s encryption is tied to a hardware key that’s stored separately from the Bluesky database, as well. If you later want to remove your data from Bluesky, you can delete your uploaded contacts and opt out.

After more than a decade of dominating the market, incumbents like Firefox, Google Chrome and Apple’s Safari are facing a fresh challenge from companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Perplexity</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/\">Arc</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/\">OpenAI</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/opera-wants-you-to-pay-20-a-month-to-use-its-ai-powered-browser-neon/\">Opera</a>, which are focused on baking in AI models and agents into their browsers to bring AI to users at the first point of contact with the internet: the web browser.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These changes don’t seem to be lost on Mozilla, which <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/organizations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">consists of several organizations</a>, one of which is the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox and other technologies, and another is its nonprofit and tax-exempt Mozilla Foundation, which oversees Mozilla’s corporate governance structure and sets the browser maker’s policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has had a tough time lately: It’s gone through a restructuring, and last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/mozilla-foundation-lays-off-30-staff-drops-advocacy-division/\">laid off 30% of its employees</a> and dropped its advocacy and global programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the potential to make a comeback amid the modern browser wars doesn’t seem to be lost on the company.

For instance, some of Google’s pre-made Gems include a learning coach, a brainstorming assistant, a career guide, a coding partner, and an editor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opal, meanwhile, focuses on helping users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/google-is-testing-a-vibe-coding-app-called-opal/\">create mini-apps</a> or mix existing apps. To use the feature, users describe the app they want to make in natural language, and the tool will use the different Gemini models to create it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Opal is directly available from Gemini on the web, where it’s found in the Gems manager. The tool has a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/opal/overview#visual_editor\">visual editor</a> that lays out the steps required to create an application. From the editor, users can rearrange steps and link them together, without writing code. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that the visual editor also includes a new view in Gemini that will take the user’s written prompts and turn them into a list of steps. This makes it even easier to build apps and see how they work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For more advanced customization options, users can move from Gemini to the Advanced Editor at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://opal.google/\">opal.google.com</a>. The mini apps can be reused after they’re created.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Known as “vibe-coding,” using AI to program and make apps has skyrocketed in popularity over the past couple of years. The market now has apps from startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/as-lovable-hits-200m-arr-its-ceo-credits-staying-in-europe-for-its-success/\">Lovable</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/coding-assistant-cursor-raises-2-3b-5-months-after-its-previous-round/\">Cursor</a>, as well as offerings from AI providers like Anthropic and OpenAI.

But coming up to transmit poses the very obvious risk of being exposed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.skanarobotics.com/\">Skana Robotics</a> thinks it’s made a breakthrough with underwater communications using AI — but not the large language models the industry touts today.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tel Aviv-based Skana has developed a new capability for its fleet management software system, SeaSphere, that allows groups of vessels to communicate with each other underwater across long distances using AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system allows vessels to share data and react to what they hear from other robots. This, Skana says, gives individual units the ability to autonomously adapt to the information they receive and change their course or task while still working toward the same general mission as the fleet. The startup says its software can also be used to secure underwater infrastructure and supply chains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Communication between vessels is one of the main challenges during the deployment of multi-domain, multi-vessel operations,” Idan Levy, the co-founder and CEO of Skana Robotics, told TechCrunch. “The problem that we tackle is how you can deploy hundreds of unmanned vessels in an operation, share data, communicate on the surface level and under the water.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teddy Lazebnik, an AI scientist and professor at the University of Haifa in Israel, led the research to develop this new capability. Lazebnik told TechCrunch that to build this decision-making algorithm, they couldn’t turn to the latest AI technology, but had to use AI algorithms that are a bit older and more mathematically driven.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The new algorithms have two properties: they are more powerful, but as a result, are less predictable,” Lazebnik said. “Hypothetically, you’re paying in the performance or the “wow effect” of the of this algorithm, but the older ones, you gain explainability, predictability and actually generality.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skana Robotics was founded in 2024 and exited stealth mode earlier this year. The company is currently focused on selling to governments and companies in Europe, as maritime threat levels increase due to the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Levy said the company is in talks for a sizable government contract that it hopes to close by the end of the year. In 2026, Skana hopes to release the commercial version of its product and start proving its tech out in the wild.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to show we can use this in scale,” Lazebnik said. “We argue that our software can handle complex maneuvers, etc. We want to show it. We claim we know how to manage an operation. We want admirals from EU and in EU countries to actually check this argument and see by themselves that we actually get results.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That gap has created an opportunity for technology companies and banks to embed lending into widely used payments apps, helping explain Google’s move into the space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flex by Google Pay is issued digitally through the Google Pay app and can be used both online and at physical merchants, the company said. Built on the Indian government-backed RuPay network, the card includes a rewards programme that credits virtual “Stars” on transactions, with each Star worth ₹1. Users can monitor spending and bills within the app, choose to repay balances in full or convert them into installments, and manage security settings such as blocking the card or resetting a PIN.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch builds on Google Pay’s broader effort to expand access to credit in India, where it has already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/google-pay-deepens-consumer-and-merchant-lending-offerings-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnered with banks and non-bank lenders</a> to <a href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/outreach-initiatives/google-for-india-2024-bringing-ai-to-every-indian-across-our-products/#:~:text=3.%20Expanding%20Financial%20Inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">offer personal</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/google-taps-india-love-for-gold-to-boost-its-credit-play/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gold-backed loans</a> through the app. As one of the country’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/29/indias-mobile-payments-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most widely used UPI platforms</a>, Google Pay offers Axis Bank access to a large, digitally active user base at a time when lenders are increasingly looking to scale credit distribution through technology platforms rather than physical branches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Google has started with Axis Bank, it aims to add more issuer partners soon to expand its co-branded credit card offering in India.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076601\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg 1740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1200,788 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1280,840 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=430,282 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=720,473 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=900,591 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=800,525 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1536,1008 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=668,438 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=571,375 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=940,617 940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=708,465 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1740px) 100vw, 1740px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pricing on the card, including interest and applicable charges, will vary by user and credit profile, with no application fee, Google said, adding that charges linked to repayment choices are shown upfront in the app. Processing fees apply to EMI conversions, and late payment charges will be levied in line with the issuing bank’s policy.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s credit card market has been expanding rapidly in recent years. The number of outstanding cards has grown at an annual rate of about 14% over the past three years to around 110 million, while transaction volumes and values have risen at close to 30%, per a recent <a href=\"https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/indian-payments-handbook-2025-2030.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PwC report</a> (PDF). Average annual spending per card has increased from about ₹132,000 (around $1,450) to roughly ₹192,000 (about $2,100), suggesting cards are being used more frequently for routine payments rather than occasional big-ticket purchases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite growth in the number of outstanding cards and credit card spending in India, the expansion has largely been driven by existing users rather than a meaningful increase in the number of cardholders. Google aims to help address that gap by bringing new users into the credit system, particularly those wary of traditional card repayment structures. “It’s the same users getting more and more credit,” said Sharath Bulusu, senior director of product management for Google Pay, adding that flexible repayment options are designed to ease concerns around unpredictable billing for first-time credit users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think we now understand the problem, the space and the user well enough to solve something uniquely for them,” Bulusu told TechCrunch, explaining Google’s timing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s move comes amid growing competition in India’s co-branded credit card market, where companies including Amazon, as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart and PhonePe, already offer similar products. Consumer internet platforms such as food delivery firms Swiggy and Zomato, along with online travel companies including MakeMyTrip and Yatra, have also entered the space in partnership with banks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-branded credit cards accounted for about 12–15% of India’s total credit cards in the financial year ended 2024 and are projected to capture more than a quarter of the market by volume by 2028, growing at an annual rate of 35–40%, according to a <a href=\"https://redseer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hyperface-Redseer-Report-The-Rise-of-Co-branded-Credit-Cards-3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report</a> (PDF) by consultancy firm Redseer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the co-branded card launch, Google is also rolling out “Pocket Money,” a feature in the Google Pay app that lets parents give children limited access to digital payments. Built on the recently introduced UPI Circle functionality, the feature lets parents set a monthly spending cap of up to ₹15,000 or approve individual transactions initiated by the child.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parents receive notifications for each transaction and can view spending history or pause access to the feature through their own Google Pay app, the company said. The move could also help Google broaden Google Pay’s usage and addressable market in India, where it <a href=\"https://entrackr.com/news/phonepe-records-94-bn-upi-transactions-in-october-10785555\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">competes closely with Walmart-backed PhonePe</a> among the country’s leading UPI platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s Pocket Money feature follows earlier efforts by Indian fintechs such as FamPay and Junio, which sought to enable children’s digital spending through prepaid cards. However, unlike prepaid instruments, Google uses the UPI Circle framework to let parents retain control of funds until the moment a transaction is made, rather than loading money in advance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With UPI Circle, the money stays in the parent’s account until it is spent,” Bulusu said, adding that the approach makes it easier for families already comfortable using Google Pay to introduce children to digital payments. He said the feature reflects a broader bet on familiar payments apps as a way to build financial confidence among younger users as digital payments become more pervasive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also upgrading the experience for small businesses on Google Pay, allowing customers to rate merchants directly after a transaction, with those reviews syncing to the merchant’s Google Maps listing. The company is also rolling out an AI-powered advertising feature within the Google Pay for Business app that assists merchants in creating and launching ads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 530 million unique users have made at least one payment through Google Pay, while over 23 million small merchants have been onboarded to the platform over the years, Bulusu said. That reach, he added, gives the company confidence it can introduce new financial products to users already comfortable transacting digitally.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round was led by ChrysCapital and Dragon Funds, with participation from Schroders Capital and existing investors TR Capital and B Capital. Early backers, including Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Venture Partners, Z47, and Ventureast, sold shares in the secondary transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal valued MoEngage at “well over” $900 million post-money, per a person close to the deal, who added that the startup was tracking toward $100 million in annualised recurring revenue this year. MoEngage did not disclose these figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage plans to use the fresh capital to invest further in its Merlin AI suite and expand its use of AI agents to improve decision-making and efficiency for marketing teams, said Raviteja Dodda (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive, in an interview. The startup is also pushing deeper into product and engineering teams by bundling its analytics and transactional messaging tools into a broader offering, a move it expects to lift average contract values and expand its addressable market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you look at customer engagement, it is not necessarily focused on marketing teams. There are product and engineering teams, which also focus on how to make sense of customer behavior and data,” Dodda said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage also plans to use part of its fresh capital raise to pursue strategic acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, targeting software companies that complement its customer engagement platform or help accelerate its expansion in those markets. It also targets small AI teams to bolster its intelligence-led offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 11-year-old startup, which has its headquarters in Bengaluru and San Francisco, already gets more than 30% of its revenue from North America, about 25% from Europe and the Middle East, and the remaining 45% from India and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage’s secondary-heavy structure of the raise reflects its late-stage position, allowing early investors and employees to take liquidity without forcing the company into a near-term public listing. This approach gives MoEngage flexibility to choose its next steps based on business priorities rather than investor exit timelines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It gives us the opportunity not to have an urgency with regard to going IPO,” Dodda said, adding that the startup still aims to go public in a couple of years, depending on market conditions and other factors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage expects to turn earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) positive this quarter and is targeting compound annual growth of about 35% over the next three years, Dodda said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bhavin Turakhia, co-founder and chief executive of fintech firm Zeta, a MoEngage customer, said the startup’s analytics and messaging tools have helped it improve onboarding, activation, and cross-sell across key customer journeys.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The secondary component of the round also enabled some early investors to exit fully. Ventureast, which backed MoEngage in 2018, is one of them. The VC firm recorded a roughly 10-times return on its investment on a blended basis, its partner Vinay Rao told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rao said that while many global customer engagement companies operate with cost structures geared toward the U.S. market, MoEngage has retained an India-based cost structure, which he said has helped it compete more effectively in the U.S. while scaling the business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the latest round, MoEngage has raised about $307 million in primary funding to date. Avendus advised MoEngage for the transaction.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anil pushed for an earlier listing than some directors wanted and signaled he might leave soon after, while board members sought more time to expand internationally and grow the company’s valuation.

Tesla said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/tesla_na/status/2001103872891486627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if that is the case, the “DMV’s authority to regulate vehicle advertising does not depend on evidence that any particular advertising actually has deceived or harmed any person,” the judge <a href=\"https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=361671590&amp;z=0992d8f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in her decision. The DMV is permitted to “act affirmatively to prevent deceptive advertising.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV did not respond to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision, though the judge addressed the company’s likely non-compliance in her decision. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Without the incentive of suspension, however, [Tesla] offers no reason for the DMV to expect that respondent will alter the Autopilot name, or will act to avoid continuing its misrepresentations to the public regarding its vehicles’ ADAS functions,” she wrote. “Suspension of respondent’s licenses is a reasonable remedy.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has faced multiple investigations from the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/tesla-under-investigation-by-california-attorney-general.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">California Attorney General</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Department of Justice</a>, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/tesla-starts-testing-robotaxis-in-austin-with-no-safety-driver/\">the company removed the safety monitors</a> from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to include information from the judge’s decision, the DMV’s press release</em>, <em>and Tesla’s response.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After going public during the pandemic and scoring a key deal with Volvo, the company had added Mercedes-Benz and Polestar as customers of its “<a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/48/luminar-ceo-says-volvo-ex90-defines-a-new-era-of-safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lifesaving</a>” lidar sensors. Founder and CEO Austin Russell <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/59/luminar-achieves-new-wins-expands-roadmap-at-ces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called it</a> an “inflection point,” as Luminar prepped to have those sensors integrated into the first production vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Volvo in particular was all in on the technology. The Swedish automaker, which spent decades building a brand around the idea of making the safest cars, was the first to jump at integrating the laser-based sensors in its vehicles. Volvo initially tapped Luminar to provide 39,500 lidar sensors over the life of a deal signed in 2020. In 2021, Volvo upped that to 673,000. And in 2022, Volvo upped it again, this time to 1.1 million sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three years later, Luminar is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">now in bankruptcy</a>. The company has already <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/111/luminar-announces-sale-of-photonics-business-to-quantum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made a deal</a> to sell off one subsidiary centered around semiconductors and is looking to sell its lidar business during the Chapter 11 process, which began on Monday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first batch of filings in the bankruptcy case shed new light on how Luminar’s cornerstone deal with Volvo came apart — and how its undoing helped push the once-promising startup over the edge.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-big-promises-then-big-revisions\">Big promises, then big revisions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar made “substantial up-front investments in equipment, facilities, and workforce” to meet the demand from Volvo back in 2022, according to a <a href=\"https://casedocs.omniagentsolutions.com/cmsvol2/pub_47582/372fc06a-000d-40d8-9eec-521770a9a89f_20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declaration</a> written by Luminar’s newly hired chief restructuring officer Robin Chiu. It built out <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/66/luminar-announces-new-automated-high-volume-factory-begins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico</a>, and spent nearly $200 million to prepare to make its Iris lidar sensors for Volvo’s EX90 SUV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Volvo was going to be a marquee customer, the stepping stone to introducing the company’s Iris product to the broader automotive industry,” one of Luminar’s lawyers said during the first hearing in the bankruptcy case on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, according to Chiu, problems were already brewing with Volvo. The automaker delayed the EX90 SUV because it needed to do more “software testing and development,” the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/11/23719686/volvo-ex90-delay-software-production-luminar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">automaker said in 2023</a>. And in early 2024, Luminar says Volvo reduced its expected volume for Iris sensors by 75%.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar’s other deals started to sour, too. Polestar (a subsidiary of Volvo) quietly gave up on integrating Luminar’s lidar sensors “because the vehicle’s software ultimately could not use” the features, according to Chiu. Mercedes-Benz terminated its agreement to buy Luminar’s Iris sensors in November 2024 because the lidar-maker “failed to meet ambitious requirements,” according to Chiu. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Mercedes-Benz struck up a new deal with Luminar in March 2025 for its next-generation Halo lidar, but Chiu wrote that Luminar has “no go-forward projects” with the German automaker at the time of bankruptcy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This left Luminar with Volvo as its lone flagship customer. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company never diversified much beyond the automotive industry, shunning other applications like defense or robotics. In fact, Russell had founded Luminar in 2012 with the goal of taking lidar out of those sectors and into automotive to help accelerate the adoption of autonomous vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It wasn’t until March of this year that Russell talked about expanding beyond automotive, as Luminar signed <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-03-27/lidar-maker-luminar-inks-deal-with-caterpillar-video\">a deal with construction equipment company Caterpillar</a>. Just two months later, Russell <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/billionaire-founder-of-luminar-replaced-as-ceo-following-ethics-inquiry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">abruptly resigned</a> following an ethics inquiry from Luminar’s board of directors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-bad-news\">“More bad news”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Chiu’s account, Volvo kept promising that it would meet the lifetime order of 1.1 million units despite the reduced volume in 2024. So Luminar kept pressing forward under that assumption. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But signs of stress were showing. Luminar laid off 20% of its workforce in May 2024 and outsourced more of its lidar sensor manufacturing. It <a href=\"https://www.luminartech.com/updates/a-message-from-founder-ceo-austin-russell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">deepened those cuts</a> and restructured some of its business in September 2024. Another round of layoffs came in May 2025 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/luminar-kicks-off-another-round-of-layoffs-amid-ceos-sudden-resignation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">after Russell resigned</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, “Volvo delivered more bad news,” Chiu wrote. The automaker decided to offer lidar as an option on the EX90 going forward, instead of making it a standard feature as originally planned. Volvo also told Luminar that it was shelving lidar on future vehicles “as a cost-cutting measure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This change reduced Volvo’s estimated lifetime volumes by approximately 90%,” Chiu wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar told Volvo on October 3 that it considered this a breach of the agreement the companies had first signed in 2020. On October 31, the dispute became public, as Luminar told shareholders in a regulatory filing that it was suspending sensor shipments to Volvo. The Swedish automaker sent Luminar a letter two weeks later, terminating the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Volvo told TechCrunch in a statement Tuesday that it “made this decision to limit the company’s supply chain risk exposure and it is a direct result of Luminar’s failure to meet its contractual obligations to Volvo Cars.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The company’s products can deliver a high level of safety and driver support, enabled by the cars’ powerful core computing coupled with their advanced sensor set — with or without a lidar,” a Volvo spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar, meanwhile, started selling lidar sensors meant for Volvo “to adjacent markets in an effort to recover its sunk costs,” according to Chiu’s filing, but it was too little too late.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As its relationship with Volvo deteriorated, [Luminar] worked tirelessly to identify new customers, but was ultimately unable to enter into production with any new customers in a timely fashion,” Chiu wrote. “The public Volvo dispute also resulted in a decline in sales due to broader market concerns over Luminar’s financial future.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the future of what’s left of Luminar is in the hands of its creditors and the court. It’s seeking the judge’s approval to sell the semiconductor subsidiary to Quantum Computing, Inc. <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/111/luminar-announces-sale-of-photonics-business-to-quantum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">for $110 million</a>, and hopes to court a number of bidders for the lidar business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar has already had significant interest in the lidar business, according to the filing. In January, Chiu wrote, the company hired investment bank Jefferies to evaluate a sale after receiving an “unsolicited acquisition proposal.” Luminar received “additional unsolicited inbound expressions of interest to acquire the Company” through the summer and fall — including one submitted by Russell through his new AI lab in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TechCrunch reported Monday, Russell <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">plans to keep bidding</a> on Luminar’s remains as the bankruptcy case moves forward. During Tuesday’s hearing, a lawyer for Luminar said it is “deep into the sale process” and “in negotiations with” several potential bidders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with a statement from Volvo and information from Luminar’s first bankruptcy hearing.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

You don’t even have to make an account! Crazy, right?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A project of Wikipedia’s volunteer community, WikiFlix hosts over 4,000 movies from Wikimedia Commons, the Internet Archive, or YouTube that have fallen into the public domain — that means they are free to share and distribute, usually because the copyright lapsed, or there was never any copyright at all. So, yes, most of the movies on the WikiFlix homepage are your grandma’s age, but isn’t it kind of fun to imagine what Netflix would’ve been like back in the day?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WikiFlix isn’t new, but it’s new to us, courtesy of a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@depthsofwikipedia/video/7582475345710845239?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok</a> by Annie Rauwerda, the creator behind the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depths_of_Wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Depths of Wikipedia</a>” accounts.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While WikiFlix can introduce you to historic films like “Wings,” the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, there’s also a bunch of hidden gems on there.

But there is some degree of curation. The community around WikiFlix maintains a blacklist, which helps ensure that you’re not going to run into a historical Nazi propaganda film during your next “WikiFlix and chill” night.

In some cases, consumers were paying as much as 23% more than other shoppers for the exact same product, the report says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software involved in the experiments, Eversight, is a SaaS product that <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/company/retailer-platform/connected-stores/eversight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">offers grocers</a> a retail pricing suite designed to “unlock revenue growth” and capitalize on “pricing solutions that scale your pricing strategy and uncover optimal prices your customers expect.” Instacart discloses on its Eversight page that some shoppers “may see slightly higher prices” than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, as previously noted, some of those price hikes seem slightly higher than “slightly higher.” A 23% price hike isn’t exactly chump change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, Instacart referred TechCrunch to a previously <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/instacart-s-commitment-to-affordability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released statement</a> in which the company noted that “just as retailers have long tested prices in physical stores to understand what resonates with customers, a small subset of our retail partners – 10 U.S. retail partners that already choose to apply markups – use Instacart’s Eversight technology to run limited online pricing tests.” The company also took issue with its activity being referred to as “dynamic pricing,” calling it instead an “AI-enabled pricing experiment.” An Instacart spokesperson said: “These tests are not dynamic pricing – prices never change in real-time, including in response to supply and demand. The tests are never based on personal or behavioral characteristics — they are completely randomized.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dynamic pricing has become increasingly common in recent years, and many big e-commerce sites have been accused of employing it. Another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/us-schools-amazon-algorithmic-pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent report</a> claimed that, due to dynamic pricing used by Amazon, school districts across the U.S. have been paying higher prices for basic school supplies. Amazon has since <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/study-amazon-dynamic-pricing-may-201721482.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">called the report</a> “flawed and misleading.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with an additional statement from Instacart. </em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Time and again over the last few years, we have seen EV companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/16/fisker-touts-31000-reservations-for-its-ocean-suv-as-production-draws-closer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tout reservation figures</a> only to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/30/the-fall-of-ev-startup-fisker-a-comprehensive-timeline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">go bust</a>, either because they weren’t able to get through the difficult process of standing up production, or because they weren’t ready to have cars on the road.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Slate, it’s promising that the number has continued to climb, meaning that new reservations are coming in faster than any attrition the company might be seeing. That said, Slate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/slate-auto-crosses-100000-refundable-reservations-in-two-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">crossed the 100,000 reservation mark</a> all the way back in May, right after it came out of stealth, so it took a good seven months to grow the list by 50%. And looking forward, Slate plans to make 150,000 of these EVs per year at the factory it’s refurbishing in Warsaw, Indiana, so it will need to attract far more buyers if it plans to succeed in the market.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Any continued enthusiasm for Slate’s EV has to be a reassuring sign for the company, given the state of electric trucks overall these days. Just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/fords-next-f-150-lightning-will-have-a-gas-generator-as-it-pivots-away-from-large-evs/\">yesterday</a>, Ford announced it is ending production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, the first major battery-powered pickup truck to hit the U.S. market a few years ago. (It’s being replaced by a version with a gas generator attached.) The company said the Lightning simply wasn’t making enough money — a fact exacerbated by how Ford was never able to sell more than a few thousand per quarter. Sales of other electric trucks, like Tesla’s Cybertruck and General Motors’ Silverado EV, have also struggled to stay above that mark.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the Lightning was a sort-of Frankenstein’s monster of a vehicle, with Ford shoehorning EV technology into a design that was originally meant for gas powertrains. Slate’s truck has been designed from the ground up to be an EV, and the company is hyper-focused on selling it for a price tag in the mid-$20,000 range. The decline of offerings from Ford and others may help clear the way for Slate to find early success — that is, until Ford’s real shot at a low-cost EV hits the market in 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The app, called <a href=\"https://www.zesty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zesty</a>, is initially available in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the app, DoorDash is branching out beyond food delivery and stepping into the social and discovery space. The idea behind the app is to get rid of the need to read a bunch of different reviews, look up different menus, or browse TikTok when looking for a new place to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once people open the app and sign in with their DoorDash accounts, they can ask an AI chatbot for personalized recommendations based on what they’re looking for. In an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zestyapp/reel/DSS6wVSD5eE/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Instagram promo post</a>, the company shared that users can type prompts like, “A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that’s actually good for introverts” to find specific recommendations. Users will also see suggested prompts, such as “Brunch spots good for groups,” and “Romantic dinner with a vintage feel.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang wrote in an <a href=\"https://x.com/andyfang/status/2000728321739645236\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">X post</a> that the app aggregates info across DoorDash, Google Maps, TikTok, and more to “curate the best suggestions from the web.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076579\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg 3960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1200,869 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1280,927 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=430,311 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=720,521 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=900,652 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=800,579 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1536,1112 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=2048,1483 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=668,484 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=518,375 518w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=852,617 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=708,513 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Zesty</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app also learns your tastes to figure out what you do and don’t like. Once you come across a recommendation you’re interested in, you can save it and share it with others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can view and share photos and comments about restaurants they’ve visited, discover content from others, and follow people just like on any social network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At DoorDash, we’re always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,” a DoorDash spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. “We’re piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. We’re excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the app’s launch was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/doordash-launches-zesty-an-ai-powered-app-for-finding-new-restaurants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, some people may not want to download a whole new app to find new restaurants when they could simply use Google.

The feature will initially become available on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the U.S. and Canada, the company says. In addition, the glasses are getting another update that lets you use Spotify to play a song that matches what’s in your current view.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you’re looking at an album cover, the glasses could play a song by that artist. Or if you’re looking at your Christmas tree with a pile of gifts, you could play holiday music. This addition is more of a gimmick, of course, but it demonstrates how Meta is thinking about connecting what people see with actions they can take in their apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conversation-focus feature, meanwhile, seems more practical. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/meta-connect-2025-what-to-expect-and-how-to-watch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">First announced at Meta’s Connect conference</a> earlier this year, the feature uses the AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to. Meta says smart glasses wearers will also be able to adjust the amplification level by swiping the right temple of their glasses, or via the device settings. This will allow them to set the level more precisely to match their current environment, whether that’s a busy restaurant or bar, club, commuter train, or anything else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How well the feature works, of course, will still need to be tested. However, the idea of using smart accessories as tools to help with hearing isn’t limited to Meta. Apple’s AirPods already offer a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/airpods/use-and-customize-transparency-mode-dev966f5f818/web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Conversation Boost feature</a> designed to help you focus on the person you’re talking to, and the Pro models more recently added support for a<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/120992\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the conversation-focus feature is limited to the U.S. and Canada, the Spotify feature is offered in English in a larger number of markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software update (v21) will first become available to those who are enrolled in Meta’s Early Access Program, which requires first joining a <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/early-access-program/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">waitlist</a> and being approved. It will later roll out more broadly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
