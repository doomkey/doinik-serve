The iPhone-maker once promised to build a giant LCD factory in Wisconsin — a project that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called the “eighth wonder of the world” during his first term</a> — and wound up underdelivering to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/12/nx-s1-5359422/what-wisconsins-foxconn-plant-can-tell-us-about-the-future-of-manufacturing-in-the-u-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an extreme degree</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn says the buyer is an “existing business partner” named “Crescent Dune LLC,” an entity that was created in Delaware just 12 days ago, according to records filed with the state. Matt Dewine, a spokesperson for Foxconn, declined to say more about the buyer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn sold the factory and land for around $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million, Taiwan stock exchange filings show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Foxconn representative told <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/an-foxconn-sells-lordstown-plant-hon-hai-ev-taiwan-0804/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Automotive News</a> the company will remain “involved in the manufacturing of products for customers at the Lordstown facility” and claimed it is “committed to customers and suppliers” in the automotive industry. But The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/lordstown-ev-plant-to-be-converted-into-ai-hardware-factory-849eadfa?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiFSyhoRht1TX_V-H1hGJ-jYkL4PNPMup93UlW2B1LohiFNj2V8HlnJY-DNsiA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689100d9&amp;gaa_sig=b44CP77AVuyIDZIOMSJofm2H-hAYI5BihC3_VZ0kzZ_wOmAZt2UOE4hq7xWWnrVET72dkBxzBZpZWMX13qIzsQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported Monday</a> that Foxconn now plans to build AI servers at the factory. Dewine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn announced the deal to buy the former GM plant in 2021 for $230 million, when it was still owned by EV startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said it was going to be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&amp;D hub in North America.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Foxconn was developing EVs of its own in Asia, it was also focused on contract manufacturing in the United States. And, in short order, three of the electric vehicle companies Foxconn hoped would occupy the factory went bankrupt.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn actually built a few EVs at the factory for the now-defunct Lordstown Motors. But the Taiwanese electronics giant wound up in a bitter fight with that troubled EV startup. Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy in June 2023, and accused Foxconn — which had become an investor in the startup — of “starving it of cash,” and said it “maliciously and in bad faith destroyed that business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn also took a flier on a small EV startup called IndiEV, claiming it would build its electric SUV at the Ohio factory. IndiEV filed for bankruptcy in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-03/second-us-foxconn-ev-customer-files-for-bankruptcy-protection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">October 2023</a> with less than $3 million in the bank. Foxconn was supposed to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/foxconn-will-build-evs-for-lordstown-motors-and-fisker-at-ohio-plant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">build EVs for Fisker Inc.</a> as well. Fisker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/fisker-bankruptcy-failure-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed for bankruptcy in June 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A fourth company, Monarch Tractor, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/monarch-tractor-lays-off-10-in-restructuring-towards-software-and-licensing-av-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not had much of an impact</a>, with Foxconn making no more than a few hundred electric tractors. Monarch’s CEO, Praveen Penmetsa, did not respond to an emailed request for comment about whether its tractors will continue to be built in Ohio.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rivian is currently able to sell EVs directly to consumers in 25 states and in Washington, D.C. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ohio’s BMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ohio’s prohibition of Rivian’s direct-sales-only business model is irrational in the extreme: it reduces competition, decreases consumer choice, and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience — all of which harm consumers — with literally no countervailing benefit,” lawyers for the company wrote in the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is asking the court to allow the company to apply for a dealership license so it can sell vehicles directly. Ohio customers have to buy from Rivian vehicles from locations in other states where direct sales are allowed. The cars are then shipped to Rivian service centers within Ohio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Allowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. Tesla has had a license to sell in Ohio since 2013 and can sell directly to consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s stopping Rivian is a 2014 law passed by the state’s legislature. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses. (The OADA did not immediately return a request for comment.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America’s economy. Ohio’s archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational, and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience,” Mike Callahan, Rivian’s chief administrative officer, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian has won legal fights over direct sales before. In 2021, Rivian and Lucid Motors were granted dealership licenses to sell EVs in Illinois. That state’s dealer association sued to try to block Rivian and Lucid from selling directly but <a href=\"https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/court-rules-that-rivian-and-lucid-may-sell-vehicles-direct-to-consumers-in-illinois.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ultimately failed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid Motors, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/news/industry-news/a41886748/lucid-motors-lawsuit-texas-dealership-rights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a lawsuit of its own in Texas in 2022</a> in a challenge to that state’s direct-sales ban. The court ruled against Lucid earlier this year, but the company has appealed, federal court records show. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

What’s changing is that the company is separating the teams that oversee Wondery’s narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wondery is combining its narrative podcast studio, which includes podcasts like Dr. Death and American Scandal, with Audible. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: The article was updated to reflect that Amazon denied reports of Wondery shutting down</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He’s pushed hard to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, not a maker of EVs. And yet, the company’s most visible products, which generate the bulk of its revenues, are its electric cars. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, Tesla EVs are advanced, particularly when it comes to its underlying vehicle architecture and software. And its driver-assistance system known as Full Self-Driving Supervised, which can be used on highways and city streets and requires hands on the wheel and the driver to be ready to take over, is considered among the most capable on the market today. But to Musk, the ultimate illustration of an AI and robotics company is self-driving cars and humanoid robots. And today, neither of them exist at any scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s first notable step toward that goal was in June when it launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Those Robotaxi-branded vehicles, which invited customers can hail via an app, have a Tesla employee sitting in the front passenger seat. But it’s still far from Musk’s original vision of a “general solution” that would allow a Tesla owner to earn money by renting out their vehicle as a robotaxi service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The clock is ticking and Musk needs to show more progress — or at the very least tease upcoming launches to keep antsy shareholders content. Which is perhaps why Tesla is embarking on this ride-hailing gambit in California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Musk noted that Tesla would be launching a robotaxi service in the Bay Area<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1943134090179334207\"> “in a month or two”</a> — regulatory approvals being the primary hang-up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem? Tesla hasn’t even applied for the permits that would allow it to operate a robotaxi service. I checked Friday morning with the California DMV, which regulates driverless testing, and Tesla has not yet applied for the necessary permits. (A spokesperson did tell me the DMV met with Tesla to discuss the company’s plans to test autonomous vehicles in the state.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, instead Tesla has launched a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area. And yeah, users keep calling these robotaxis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, while folks — including Musk’s brother and Tesla board member Kimbal Musk — <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/kimbal/status/1951035194984767838\">may refer to these as robotaxis</a>, they are not driving autonomously. (And if they are, it would be a violation of current regulations.) Again, Tesla does not currently have the permits to do anything beyond pay its own employees to use its fleet of EVs to drive people around the Bay Area. No autonomous driving in any way, shape, or form. You can read a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/tesla-wants-to-bring-its-robotaxis-to-san-francisco-heres-whats-standing-in-the-way/\">recent explainer here</a> that will take you through all of the various permits Tesla needs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ride-hailing launch has many folks wondering, what gives? My answer: optics.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recent chatter among some little birds suggests that the <strong>National Automobile Dealers Association</strong> is focusing its efforts on VW Group spinout <strong>Scout</strong> and the EV company’s plans for direct sales.

Logistics company Flexport had captured the attention of Silicon Valley, in part because of founder Ryan Petersen’s fallout with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/ousted-flexport-ceo-dave-clark-strikes-back/\">ousted CEO Dave Clark</a> and because of its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/01/flexport-acquires-technology-of-former-digital-freight-unicorn-convoy/\">acquisition of Convoy</a>, the former freight tech unicorn that had just shut down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s an update. Flexport has now <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/flexport-sells-former-freight-unicorn-convoys-tech-two-years-after-buying-it/\">sold the Convoy platform</a> to <strong>DAT Freight &amp; Analytics</strong>. The terms were undisclosed, although the company said it had delivered a “massive return on investment for Flexport.” Reporting from Axios’ Dan Primack suggests that, yes, indeed “massive return” is an appropriate description. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flexport never disclosed exactly what it had paid for Convoy’s tech, although reporting at the time put the figure at $16 million — a fraction of the unicorn’s previous valuation of $3.8 billion.

The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages “in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences,” Cloudflare’s researchers wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. In recent times, websites have tried to fight back by using the web standard Robots.txt file, which tells search engines and AI companies which pages can be indexed and which shouldn’t, efforts <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/multiple-ai-companies-bypassing-web-standard-scrape-publisher-sites-licensing-2024-06-21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">that have seen mixed results so far</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots’ “user agent,” meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type, as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,” read Cloudflare’s post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer dismissed Cloudflare’s blog post as a “sales pitch,” adding in an email to TechCrunch that the screenshots in the post “show that no content was accessed.” In a follow-up email, Dwyer claimed the bot named in the Cloudflare blog “isn’t even ours.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity’s known bots. Cloudflare said it then performed tests to check and confirmed that Perplexity was circumventing these blocks. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent, but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked,” according to Cloudflare.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also said that it has de-listed Perplexity’s bots from its verified list and added new techniques to block them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare has recently taken a public stance against AI crawlers. Last month, Cloudflare <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-launches-a-marketplace-that-lets-websites-charge-ai-bots-for-scraping/\">announced the launch of a marketplace</a> allowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Cloudflare’s chief executive Matthew Prince <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/bernard-l-schwartz-annual-lecture-matthew-prince-cloudflare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sounded the alarm</a> at the time, saying AI is breaking the business model of the internet, particularly publishers. Last year, Cloudflare also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/cloudflare-launches-a-tool-to-combat-ai-bots/#:~:text=Cloudflare%20has%20set%20up%20a,demand%20for%20model%20training%20data.\">launched a free tool</a> to prevent bots from scraping websites to train AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not the first time Perplexity is accused of scraping without authorization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, news outlets, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">such as Wired</a>, alleged <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/news-outlets-are-accusing-perplexity-of-plagiarism-and-unethical-web-scraping/\">Perplexity was plagiarizing their content</a>. Weeks later, Perplexity’s CEO Aravind Srinivas <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/perplexitys-ceo-punts-on-defining-plagiarism/\">was unable to immediately answer</a> when asked to provide the company’s definition of plagiarism during an interview with TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey at the Disrupt 2024 conference.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The X owner <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1951697566325981414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> over the weekend that the company discovered the video archive for the popular short-form video app, thought to have been deleted, and is working to restore user access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vine — something of a precursor to today’s TikTok, but with only six-second-long looping videos — was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/if-twitter-gets-into-the-video-hosting-game-it-could-be-a-wonderful-and-horrible-thing/\">acquired by Twitter back in October 2012</a> for $30 million to expand the social media platform’s video ambitions. Unfortunately for Vine creators and fans, the company fumbled the app’s potential and decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/\">shut down Vine in 2016</a> by limiting all new uploads. The following year, it was fully discontinued, though a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/twitter-just-cant-let-go-of-vine-launches-an-online-archive/\">user archive</a> remained for a time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite no longer having an App Store presence, Vine still has a place in the internet’s collective cultural consciousness. Through online compilations of the best Vines uploaded to YouTube, and through the careers of numerous creators who got their start on Vine, the company lives on to some extent, and its content continues to be discovered by new generations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk himself seemed interested in bringing back Vine after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/\">acquiring Twitter in October 2022</a>. In <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1586918804780630016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a poll posted</a> on the social media app, he asked Twitter’s users, “Bring back Vine?” to which nearly 70% responded “yes.” <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/10/31/vine-tiktok-twitter-musk-team-reboot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios reported at the time</a> that Twitter had devoted some engineers to working on the Vine reboot, but nothing ever came of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear whether Musk has any ambitions for Vine beyond getting its archive back online, however. In the same post about restoring Vine, he also touted that Grok’s new video-creation feature, Grok Imagine, also available to X Premium+ subscribers, is “AI Vine.” That suggests that his interests in video creation no longer lie with human creativity, but in human-directed AI prompting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether or not Musk will actually deliver on the promise remains to be seen, as the X post could have just been another way to draw attention to Grok AI, rather than being representative of a real effort inside the company to make old Vines available for reposting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

There are limits to how explicit one can get. Many of our spicier prompts — made in the name of Journalism! — generate blurred-out images that are “moderated” and therefore inaccessible. We were, however, able to generate semi-nude imagery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NSFW content is unsurprising for xAI, given the release last month of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/elon-musks-grok-is-making-ai-companions-including-a-goth-anime-girl/\">raunchy, hyper-sexualized anime AI companion</a>. But just as Grok’s unrestrained nature was entertaining until it started spewing hateful, antisemitic, misogynistic content, Grok Imagine could be poised to bring its own set of unintended consequences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/grok-video-generator-will-spicy-mode-says-xai-employee-rcna221807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC first reported</a> the existence of a “<a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1952171629485711479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spicy mode</a>” last week after xAI employee Mati Roy said in a now-deleted post on X: “Grok Imagine videos have a spicy mode that can <a href=\"https://x.com/dreamworks2050/status/1952301119608398124\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">do nudity</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The existing limitations with Grok Imagine are somewhat heartening given the model also lets you create content of celebrities — anyone from Donald Trump to Taylor Swift — and there appear to be additional restrictions on those. For example, TechCrunch tried, and failed, to generate an image of Trump pregnant. Grok Imagine only generated images of Trump holding a baby or next to a pregnant woman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s still early days for Grok Imagine, which aims to compete with incumbents like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Runway, and Chinese rivals, the images and videos generated of humans are still a bit lost in the uncanny valley, with waxy-looking skin that verges on cartoonish at times. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the generator is impressive. It produces images in seconds from a text prompt, and continues to auto-generate new images as you scroll. Those images can then be animated into stylized videos. The user interface is also seamless and intuitive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk said<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1952104431367208981?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=xai-launches-grok-imagine-video-generator&amp;_bhlid=f6bb04152b3f05dd8588deb56b7dc9a215665d7f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> on X</a> that the model would “get better every day.”</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The companies want to launch robotaxi services in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2026, pending regulatory approval. <br><br>If approved, Baidu’s RT6 vehicles, which are equipped with its Apollo Go self-driving system, will be integrated into Lyft’s ride-hailing app. Lyft CEO David Risher said the robotaxi service is an example of its “hybrid network approach, where AVs and human drivers work together to provide customer-obsessed options for riders.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft has historically centered its ride-hailing business on the United States, while rival Uber has expanded globally and into other areas, like food delivery. But earlier this year, Lyft bought its way into the European market when it agreed to acquire the German multi-mobility app FREENOW from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/lyft-to-buy-taxi-app-freenow-for-197m-to-enter-europe/\">about $197 million in cash</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition opened the European market to Lyft, which has only operated in the U.S. and Canada since it launched in 2012.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft and Uber, both of which sunsetted their own internal autonomous vehicle programs, are in a race to lock up partnerships with companies like Baidu, which have developed the technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has partnered with more than 18 companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/how-ubers-new-product-chief-is-gearing-up-for-robotaxis/\">ride-hailing</a>, delivery, and trucking. In this year alone, it has announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/uber-and-volkswagen-pair-up-to-launch-robotaxi-service-with-self-driving-electric-microbuses/\">Volkswagen</a>, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/uber-invests-100m-in-weride-to-fuel-robotaxi-expansion-across-15-more-cities/\">WeRide</a>, and Baidu. Last month, Uber invested <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/uber-makes-multi-million-dollar-investment-in-lucid-nuro-to-build-robotaxi-service/\">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> into EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro in a bid to launch its own premium robotaxi service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft hasn’t had the same pace of deals as Uber, but has made a few partnerships in the past year, including a plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/lyft-to-add-autonomous-shuttles-in-2026-as-uber-inks-more-self-driving-deals/\">add autonomous shuttles</a> made by Austrian manufacturer Benteler Group to its network in late 2026. Lyft has also said it plans to put <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/lyft-partners-with-may-mobility-mobileye-to-bring-autonomous-vehicles-to-the-app/\">AVs from May Mobility</a> on its network in Atlanta later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The aim is to generate funds for North Korea’s sanctioned nuclear weapons program, which has so far made <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">billions of dollars for the regime</a> to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not known exactly how many North Korean IT workers are currently working for unknowing U.S. companies, but some have estimated the number to be in the thousands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to CrowdStrike, the North Korean IT workers, which the company calls “Famous Chollima” using its naming scheme of hacking groups, rely on generative AI and other AI-powered tools to draft resumes and modify or “deepfake” their appearance during remote interviews. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the scheme is not new</a>, North Koreans are increasingly succeeding at getting jobs, despite sanctions preventing U.S. companies from hiring North Korean workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CrowdStrike said in its report that one of the ways to prevent hiring sanctioned workers is by implementing better identity verification processes during the hiring phase. TechCrunch has anecdotally heard of some crypto-focused companies asking prospective employees to say critical things about North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, in an effort to weed out potential spies. The would-be North Korean employees are often highly monitored and surveilled, making any such request impossible and likely outing the fraudulent worker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Justice has sought to disrupt these operations by going after the U.S.-based facilitators who help <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/us-indicts-five-individuals-in-crackdown-on-north-koreas-illicit-it-workforce/\">run and operate the scheme</a> for their North Korean bosses.

Liphardt said that he’s a big believer in getting the tech out there and iterating on it after the fact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We full well expect all the humans that will be hosting these quadrupeds, they’ll come back with a long list of things they didn’t like or they want, and then it’s up to us to very, very quickly iterate and improve the machines,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also recently raised a $20 million funding round led by Pantera Capital, with participation from Ribbit, Coinbase Ventures, and Pebblebed, among other strategic investors and angel investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company is focused on getting its tech into people’s homes and starting to iterate on the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The most important thing for us is to get robots out there and to get feedback,” Liphardt said. “Our goal as a company is to do as many of these tests as we can, so that we can very rapidly identify the most interesting opportunities where the capabilities of the robots today are optimally matched against what humans are looking for.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Joby.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blade’s medical division, which transports organs, isn’t included in the transaction and will remain a separate company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal gives Joby instant access to a network of 12 terminals in key markets like New York City — notably, a dedicated lounge as well as terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty Airport, the West Side of Manhattan, the East Side of Manhattan, and Wall Street.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blade, founded in 2014, doesn’t own a fleet of aircraft. Instead, the company has developed a digital network that allows passengers to book private rides on helicopters across several short-hop routes. The service has grown in popularity as well-heeled customers seek ways to avoid traffic on their commutes from the suburbs into Manhattan, or to The Hamptons for weekends and holidays. The company, which also offers access to routes from Nice, France, to Monaco and Saint-Tropez, flew more than 50,000 passengers in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt described the deal as a “strategically important” acquisition that will support its launch of its commercial operations in Dubai and subsequent global rollout. The company said it will integrate its software, which is designed to manage air taxi operations, into Blade’s passenger service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joby, founded in 2009 by Bevirt, has been working for more than a decade to develop, certify, and produce an electric vertical take off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial taxi service in cities. (The company is also pursuing a separate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/joby-aviation-and-defense-contractor-l3harris-to-test-a-new-class-of-aircraft/\">defense-related business</a>.)

Tesla says it will put “a longer-term CEO compensation strategy” to a vote at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for November.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s new compensation plan will be entirely voided if the Delaware Supreme Court decides to overturn a judge’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/30/elon-musks-56b-tesla-pay-deal-is-unfair-judge-rules/\">January 2024 decision</a> to strike down Musk’s 2018 compensation package because of how it was negotiated behind the scenes. That pay package was worth around $56 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has threatened to stop working on AI and robotics at Tesla <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-seeks-25-voting-share-tesla-2024-01-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unless he gains more control over the company</a>. Those threats preceded what is now a multimillion-dollar talent war among the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/meta-is-offering-multimillion-dollar-pay-for-ai-researchers-but-not-100m-signing-bonuses/\">biggest companies in the artificial intelligence space</a>, along with a rush of mergers and acquisitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, Musk has built up his own AI company outside Tesla called xAI, which now owns X, his social media platform. This has happened while Tesla’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/tesla-profits-pulled-down-by-falling-ev-sales-and-regulatory-credits/\">sales growth has vanished</a> and its brand has been damaged by Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Tesla/status/1952310686937190721\">said</a> Monday that its board of directors formed a special committee earlier this year consisting of chairwoman Robyn Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in order to sort out a new package. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The award they ultimately decided on involves giving Musk 96 million shares that will vest in two years, provided that he “serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla” during that term and holds the stock for five years. Unlike Tesla’s previous award to Musk, this new package does not appear to be tied to goals like increasing the company’s stock price.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Tesla’s Monday premarket trading price, that would be worth around $29 billion. Musk will have to pay a $23.34-per-share purchase price, bringing the total current value of the award to him to roughly $26.7 billion. Depending on how the Delaware Supreme Court rules on Tesla’s appeal, the package may be forfeited so “there cannot be any ‘double dip,’ according to Tesla.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Elon will not be able to keep this new award in addition to the options he will be awarded under the 2018 CEO Performance Award should the courts rule in our favor,” the company wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla said Musk and his brother Kimbal, who is also a board member, recused themselves from the process of constructing this new compensation package. Musk’s involvement in the 2018 compensation package was one of the reasons Delaware Chancery Court Judge Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/30/elon-musks-56b-tesla-pay-deal-is-unfair-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decided to strike it down</a> following a trial sparked by a shareholder lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McCormick said the process of creating that 2018 plan was “deeply flawed” because of Musk’s input and his deep connections to the people on Tesla’s board. She also criticized that plan for not including any terms that would bind Musk to Tesla for “any set amount of time” — a likely reason for the two-year pledge included in the new plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McCormick’s decision caused an uproar among Tesla’s largest fans and many of its shareholders. It’s also what inspired the company to re-incorporate from Delaware to Texas, a state with fewer established shareholder protections written into its laws. Tesla went as far as holding a shareholder vote to “re-affirm” the pay package. But McCormick <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/judge-confirms-decision-to-sink-elon-musks-56b-pay-package-despite-tesla-shareholder-vote/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">confirmed her decision in December 2024</a>, saying the vote and Tesla’s legal arguments were “unprecedented theories [that] go against multiple strains of settled law.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: This story and the headline have been updated to reflect that the award has been approved by Tesla’s board and does not need a shareholder vote. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Meanwhile, Lightman quietly worked on a team teaching OpenAI’s models to solve high school math competitions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today that team, known as MathGen, is considered instrumental to OpenAI’s industry-leading effort to create AI reasoning models: the core technology behind AI agents that can do tasks on a computer like a human would.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were trying to make the models better at mathematical reasoning, which at the time they weren’t very good at,” Lightman told TechCrunch, describing MathGen’s early work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s models are far from perfect today — the company’s latest AI systems <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/\">still hallucinate</a> and its agents <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/browser-haunted-by-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">struggle with complex tasks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But its state-of-the-art models have improved significantly on mathematical reasoning. One of OpenAI’s models recently won a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/openai-and-google-outdo-the-mathletes-but-not-each-other/\">gold medal </a>at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a math competition for the world’s brightest high school students. OpenAI believes these reasoning capabilities will translate to other subjects, and ultimately power general-purpose agents that the company has always dreamed of building.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT was a happy accident — a low-key research preview turned viral consumer business — but OpenAI’s agents are the product of a yearslong, deliberate effort within the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Eventually, you’ll just ask the computer for what you need and it’ll do all of these tasks for you,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/everything-announced-at-openais-first-developer-event/\">first developer conference</a> in 2023. “These capabilities are often talked about in the AI field as agents. The upsides of this are going to be tremendous.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the OpenAI DevDay event on November 06, 2023 in San Francisco, California.\" class=\"wp-image-2625318\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg 2573w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778704897.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the OpenAI DevDay event on November 06, 2023, in San Francisco, California.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Justin Sullivan / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether agents will meet Altman’s vision remains to be seen, but OpenAI shocked the world with the release of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/12/openai-unveils-a-model-that-can-fact-check-itself/\">its first AI reasoning model, o1,</a> in the fall of 2024. Less than a year later, the 21 foundational researchers behind that breakthrough are the most highly sought-after talent in Silicon Valley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/meta-hires-key-openai-researcher-to-work-on-ai-reasoning-models/\">recruited</a> five of the o1 researchers to work on Meta’s new superintelligence-focused unit, offering some compensation packages north of $100 million.

RL provides feedback to an AI model on whether its choices were correct in simulated environments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RL has been used for decades. For instance, in 2016, about a year after OpenAI was founded in 2015, an AI system created by Google DeepMind using RL, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/google-ai-beats-go-world-champion-again-to-complete-historic-4-1-series-victory/\">AlphaGo</a>, gained global attention after beating a world champion in the board game Go.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033346\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=430,276 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=720,462 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=900,578 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=800,513 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=668,429 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=584,375 584w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=962,617 962w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=708,454 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-515358462.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">South Korean professional Go player Lee Se-Dol (R) prepares for his fourth match against Google’s artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo, during the Google DeepMind Challenge Match on March 13, 2016, in Seoul, South Korea.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around that time, one of OpenAI’s first employees, Andrej Karpathy, began pondering how to leverage RL to create an AI agent that could use a computer. But it would take years for OpenAI to develop the necessary models and training techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2018, OpenAI pioneered its first large language model in the GPT series, pretrained on massive amounts of internet data and large clusters of GPUs. GPT models excelled at text processing, eventually leading to ChatGPT, but struggled with basic math. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took until 2023 for OpenAI to achieve a breakthrough, initially dubbed “Q*” and then “Strawberry,” by combining LLMs, RL, and a technique called “test-time computation.” The latter gave the models extra time and computing power to plan and work through problems, verifying its steps, before providing an answer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This allowed OpenAI to introduce a new approach called “chain-of-thought” (CoT), which improved AI’s performance on math questions the models hadn’t seen before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I could see the model starting to reason,” said OpenAI researcher Ahmed El-Kishky. “It would notice mistakes and backtrack, it would get frustrated. It really felt like reading the thoughts of a person.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though individually these techniques weren’t novel, OpenAI uniquely combined them to create Strawberry, which directly led to the development of o1. OpenAI quickly identified that the planning and fact-checking abilities of AI reasoning models could be useful to power AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We had solved a problem that I had been banging my head against for a couple of years,” said Lightman. “It was one of the most exciting moments of my research career.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scaling-reasoning\">Scaling reasoning</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With AI reasoning models, OpenAI determined it had two new axes that would allow it to improve AI models: using more computational power during the post-training of AI models, and giving AI models more time and processing power while answering a question.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI, as a company, thinks a lot about not just the way things are, but the way things are going to scale,” said Lightman.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after the 2023 Strawberry breakthrough, OpenAI spun up an “Agents” team led by OpenAI researcher Daniel Selsam to make further progress on this new paradigm, two sources told TechCrunch. Although the team was called “Agents,” OpenAI didn’t initially differentiate between reasoning models and agents as we think of them today. The company just wanted to make AI systems capable of completing complex tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, the work of Selsam’s Agents team became part of a larger project to develop the o1 reasoning model, with leaders including OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, chief research officer Mark Chen, and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Ilya Sutskever, Russian Israeli-Canadian computer scientist and co-founder and Chief Scientist of OpenAI.\" class=\"wp-image-2797714\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Ilya Sutskever, computer scientist and co-founder and former Chief Scientist of OpenAI.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>JACK GUEZ / AFP / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI would have to divert precious resources — mainly talent and GPUs — to create o1. Throughout OpenAI’s history, researchers have had to negotiate with company leaders to obtain resources; demonstrating breakthroughs was a surefire way to secure them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the core components of OpenAI is that everything in research is bottom up,” said Lightman. “When we showed the evidence [for o1], the company was like, ‘This makes sense, let’s push on it.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some former employees say that the startup’s mission to develop AGI was the key factor in achieving breakthroughs around AI reasoning models. By focusing on developing the smartest-possible AI models, rather than products, OpenAI was able to prioritize o1 above other efforts. That type of large investment in ideas wasn’t always possible at competing AI labs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to try new training methods proved prescient. By late 2024, several leading AI labs started seeing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/\">diminishing returns</a> on models created through traditional pretraining scaling. Today, much of the AI field’s momentum comes from advances in reasoning models.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-mean-for-an-ai-to-reason\"><strong>What does it mean for an AI to “reason</strong><strong>”</strong>?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, the goal of AI research is to re-create human intelligence with computers. Since the launch of o1, ChatGPT’s UX has been filled with more human-sounding features such as “thinking” and “reasoning.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked whether OpenAI’s models were truly reasoning, El-Kishky hedged, saying he thinks about the concept in terms of computer science.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re teaching the model how to efficiently expend compute to get an answer. So if you define it that way, yes, it is reasoning,” said El-Kishky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightman takes the approach of focusing on the model’s results and not as much on the means or their relation to human brains.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"The OpenAI logo on screen at their developer day stage.\" class=\"wp-image-2625161\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=1200,802 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=1280,855 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=900,601 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=561,375 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=924,617 924w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Devin Coldewey</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the model is doing hard things, then it is doing whatever necessary approximation of reasoning it needs in order to do that,” said Lightman. “We can call it reasoning, because it looks like these reasoning traces, but it’s all just a proxy for trying to make AI tools that are really powerful and useful to a lot of people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s researchers note people may disagree with their nomenclature or definitions of reasoning — and surely, <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/a-knockout-blow-for-llms?r=8tdk6&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">critics have emerged</a> — but they argue it’s less important than the capabilities of their models. Other AI researchers tend to agree.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nathan Lambert, an AI researcher with the non-profit AI2, compares AI reasoning modes to airplanes in a <a href=\"https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-rise-of-reasoning-machines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. Both, he says, are man-made systems inspired by nature — human reasoning and bird flight, respectively — but they operate through entirely different mechanisms. That doesn’t make them any less useful, or any less capable of achieving similar outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A group of AI researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind agreed in a recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/research-leaders-urge-tech-industry-to-monitor-ais-thoughts/\">position paper</a> that AI reasoning models are not well understood today, and more research is needed. It may be too early to confidently claim what exactly is going on inside them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-next-frontier-ai-agents-for-subjective-tasks\">The next frontier: AI agents for subjective tasks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI agents on the market today work best for well-defined, verifiable domains such as coding.

Meanwhile, Anthropic’s models have become particularly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">popular</a> in AI coding tools like Cursor and Claude Code — these are some of the first AI agents that people are willing to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">pay up for</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, general-purpose AI agents like OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt/\">ChatGPT agent</a> and Perplexity’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Comet</a> struggle with many of the complex, subjective tasks people want to automate. When trying to use these tools for online shopping or finding a long-term parking spot, I’ve found the agents take longer than I’d like and make <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/openais-operator-agent-helped-me-move-but-i-had-to-help-it-too/?_thumbnail_id=2593103\">silly mistakes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents are, of course, early systems that will undoubtedly improve. But researchers must first figure out how to better train the underlying models to complete tasks that are more subjective.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033358\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg 8256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like many problems in machine learning, it’s a data problem,” said Lightman when asked about the limitations of agents on subjective tasks. “Some of the research I’m really excited about right now is figuring out how to train on less verifiable tasks. We have some leads on how to do these things.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Noam Brown, an OpenAI researcher who helped create the IMO model and o1, told TechCrunch that OpenAI has new general-purpose RL techniques that allow them to teach AI models skills that aren’t easily verified. This was how the company built the model that achieved a gold medal at IMO, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s IMO model was a newer AI system that spawns multiple agents, which then simultaneously explore several ideas and then choose the best possible answer. These types of AI models are becoming more popular; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/google-rolls-out-gemini-deep-think-ai-a-reasoning-model-that-tests-multiple-ideas-in-parallel/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/\">xAI</a> have recently released state-of-the-art models using this technique.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think these models will become more capable at math, and I think they’ll get more capable in other reasoning areas as well,” said Brown. “The progress has been incredibly fast. I don’t see any reason to think it will slow down.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These techniques may help OpenAI’s models become more performant, gains that could show up in the company’s upcoming GPT-5 model. OpenAI hopes to assert its dominance over competitors with the launch of GPT-5, ideally offering the <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-openais-rocky-path-gpt-5?rc=dp0mql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">best AI model</a> to power agents for developers and consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the company also wants to make its products simpler to use. El-Kishky says OpenAI wants to develop AI agents that intuitively understand what users want, without requiring them to select specific settings. He says OpenAI aims to build AI systems that understand when to call up certain tools, and how long to reason for.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These ideas paint a picture of an ultimate version of ChatGPT: an agent that can do anything on the internet for you, and understand how you want it to be done. That’s a much different product than what ChatGPT is today, but the company’s research is squarely headed in this direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI undoubtedly led the AI industry a few years ago, the company now faces a tranche of worthy opponents. The question is no longer just whether OpenAI can deliver its agentic future, but can the company do so before Google, Anthropic, xAI, or Meta beat them to it?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
