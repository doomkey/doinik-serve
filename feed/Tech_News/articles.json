People feared that ads had arrived, even for paid customers. OpenAI, however, clarified that the app suggestion was not an advertisement, but instead a poor attempt to integrate an app discovery feature within conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Yuchenj_UW\">a post on X</a>, which has since been viewed nearly 462,000 times, AI startup Hyberbolic’s co-founder, Yuchen Jin, shared a screenshot where ChatGPT seemingly suggested connecting the Peloton app in an unrelated conversation. Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT’s $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The post, which was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/_dmca/status/1995572734617939973?s=20\">reshared</a> and saved hundreds of times across X, received quite a bit of attention, as it seemed to indicate OpenAI was testing the insertion of ads into its paid product. Users complained that paying customers, especially, shouldn’t have to see app suggestions like this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/dgrreen/status/1995594572488233020\">One person also pointed out</a> that they couldn’t get ChatGPT to stop recommending Spotify to them, even though they were an Apple Music subscriber. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s data lead for ChatGPT, Daniel McAuley, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/_dmca/status/1995572734617939973?s=20\">later jumped into the thread</a> to clarify that the Peloton placement was not an ad; it was “only a suggestion to install Peloton’s app.” He said there was “no financial component” to the appearance of the app suggestion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he admitted that “the lack of relevancy” to the conversation made it a bad and confusing experience, and OpenAI was iterating on the suggestions and the user experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A company spokesperson also confirmed to TechCrunch that what users had spotted was one of the ways OpenAI had been “testing surfacing apps in ChatGPT conversations.” They pointed to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\">OpenAI’s announcement in October</a> about its new app platform, where the company noted that apps would “fit naturally” into user conversations. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can discover [apps] when ChatGPT suggests one at the right time, or by calling them by name. Apps respond to natural language and include interactive interfaces you can use right in the chat,” the post explained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that didn’t appear to be the case here, as the user claims they weren’t discussing anything related to health and fitness. Instead, as the screenshot shows, they had been chatting with the AI about a podcast featuring Elon Musk, where xAI was the topic being discussed. Inserting Peloton into this experience was unhelpful and a distraction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet even if the app suggestion had been relevant, users may have still viewed it as an ad, given that it’s directing people to a product from a business that isn’t free. In addition, users can’t turn off these app suggestions, which may make them feel more intrusive.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This user sentiment could have potential ramifications for OpenAI’s desire to replace the App Store experience, and apps that run on your phone, with integrated apps that run within ChatGPT. If users don’t want to see app suggestions, they could choose to switch to a competitor’s chatbot to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, ChatGPT apps are available to logged-in users outside of the EU, Switzerland, and the U.K., and the integrations are still in pilot testing. OpenAI partners with a number of app makers, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Zillow, and others. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We asked Taylor if the company had received any communication from the hackers, such as a demand for money, along with other specific questions about the breach, including whether Mixpanel employee accounts were protected with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of its affected customers is OpenAI, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/mixpanel-incident/\">published its own blog post</a> two days later, confirming what Mixpanel had failed to explicitly say in its own post, that customer data had been taken from Mixpanel’s systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said it was affected by the breach because it relied on software provided by Mixpanel to help understand how OpenAI users interact with certain parts of its website, such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview\">its developer documentation</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI users affected by the Mixpanel breach are likely to be developers whose own apps or websites rely on OpenAI’s products to work. OpenAI said its stolen data included the user’s provided name, email addresses, their approximate location (such as city and state) based on their IP address, and some identifiable device data, such as the operating system and browser version. Some of this information is the same kind of data that Mixpanel collects from people’s devices as they use apps and browse websites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For its part, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix told TechCrunch that the breached data taken from Mixpanel “did not contain identifiers such as Android advertising ID or Apple’s IDFA,” which may have made it easier to personally identify specific OpenAI users or combine their OpenAI activity with usage from other apps and websites. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said in its blog post that the incident did not affect ChatGPT users directly and terminated its use of Mixpanel as a result of the breach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While details of the breach remain limited, this incident draws fresh scrutiny of the data analytics industry, which profits from collecting reams of information about how people use websites and apps. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-mixpanel-tracks-taps-clicks-and-watches-your-screen-nbsp\">How Mixpanel tracks taps, clicks, and watches your screen<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mixpanel is one of the largest web and mobile analytics companies that you might have never heard of, unless you work in the app development or marketing space. According to its website, Mixpanel has 8,000 corporate customers — one less now, following OpenAI’s early exit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With each Mixpanel customer having potentially millions of users of their own, the number of ordinary people whose data was taken in the breach could be significant. The type of breached data is likely to vary by each Mixpanel customer, depending on how each customer configured their data collection and how much user data they collected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like Mixpanel are part of a booming industry providing tracking technologies that allow companies to understand how their customers and users interact with their apps and websites. As such, analytics companies can collect and store vast amounts of information, including billions of data points, about regular consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, an app maker or website developer can embed a piece of code from an analytics company like Mixpanel inside their app or website to gain that visibility. For the app user or website visitor, it’s like having someone watch over your shoulder without your knowledge as you browse a website or use an app, while it constantly shares every click or tap, swipe, and link press with the company that develops the app or website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Mixpanel’s case, it’s easy to see the types of data that Mixpanel collects from the apps and websites that its code is embedded in. Using open source tools like Burp Suite, TechCrunch analyzed the network traffic flowing in and out of several apps with Mixpanel code inside — such as Imgur, Lingvano, Neon, and Park Mobile. In our various tests, we saw varying degrees of information about our device and in-app activity uploaded to Mixpanel while using the apps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This data can include the person’s activity, such as opening the app, tapping a link, swiping a page, or signing in with their username and password, for example. This event logging data is then attached to information about the user and their device, including the device type (such as iPhone or Android), the screen width and height, if the user is on the phone network or Wi-Fi, the user’s cell network carrier, the logged-in user’s unique identifier for that service (which can be tied to the app user), and the precise timestamp for that event. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The collected data can sometimes include information that should be off-limits. Mixpanel <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/mixpanel-passwords/\">admitted in 2018 that its analytics code</a> inadvertently collected users’ passwords.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data collected by analytics companies is meant to be pseudonymized — essentially scrambled in a way that it doesn’t include identifiable details, such as a person’s name. Instead, the collected information is attributed to a unique but seemingly random identifier that’s used in place of a person’s name; an ostensibly more privacy-preserving way of storing the data. But pseudonymized data <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/07/no-hashing-still-doesnt-make-your-data-anonymous\">can be reversed and used to identify people’s real-world identities</a>. And, data collected about a person’s device can be used to uniquely identify that device, known as “fingerprinting,” which can also be used to track that user’s activity across different apps and across the internet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By tracking what you do on your device across various apps, analytics companies make it easier for their customers to build up profiles of users and their activity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mixpanel also allows its customers to collect “session replays,” which visually reconstruct how the company’s users interact with an app or website so that the developer can identify bugs and problems. Session replays are meant to exclude personally identifiable or sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, from any collected user session, but this process isn’t perfect, either. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Mixpanel’s own admission, session replays can sometimes <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/session-replay\">include sensitive information</a> that should not have been logged, but are collected inadvertently. Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/apple-glassbox-apps/\">cracked down</a> on apps that use screen recording code after TechCrunch exposed the practice in 2019.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To say that Mixpanel has questions to answer about its breach is perhaps an understatement. Without knowing the specific types of data involved, it’s not clear how big a breach this is or how many people might be affected. It may be that Mixpanel doesn’t yet know. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What is clear is that companies like Mixpanel store huge banks of information about people and how they use their apps, and are clearly becoming a focus for malicious hackers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the Mixpanel data breach?

The new “ultra-fast” delivery option will allow Amazon to better compete with services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Instacart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customers will be able to order a range of different items, including milk, eggs, fresh produce, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet treats, diapers, paper products, electronics, seasonal items, over-the-counter medicines, chips, dips, and more, according to the company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prime members can choose the fast delivery option for a $3.99 fee per order, while non-Prime members will have to pay $13.99.

So it’s more capable of doing, repeating whatever human activities in the digital world,” co-founder CEO Ang Li told TechCrunch, offering the example of copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday it announced the release of its 1.0 version for Mac OS. But it’s also working with Microsoft to develop an agent for Windows. The startup is one of five agentic companies accepted into the Windows 365 for Agents program <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/windows-365-for-agents-unlocks-secured-scalable-ai-automation/4468107\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Microsoft announced in mid November.</a> (The others are Manus AI, Fellou, Genspark, and TinyFish.) As for the timeline for the Windows version, Li was vague except to say it promises to be as or more popular than the Mac version. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another reason to watch Simular is the bona fides of the founders: Li is a continuous learning scientist who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, where he met his co-founder, reinforcement learning specialist Jiachen Yang. While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn’t strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley’s dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\">hallucinate</a> some percentage of the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agentic tasks can require completing thousands to millions of discrete steps. Not only can a hallucination at any single step invalidate all of the agent’s work, but hallucinations become statistically more likely as the number of steps grows.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One way to solve this is to make the “non deterministic” LLM “deterministic,” meaning instead of allowing the LLM to be endlessly creative, its responses or actions are scripted the same each time. But that risks limiting the whole creative problem-solving aspect of an agent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Simular is marrying the two. Its agent will iterate freely on the task, with the human user in the middle course correcting, until the agent achieves success. Then the human locks in that task’s workflow, which makes it deterministic, repeatable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our solution is, let agents keep exploring the successful trajectory. Once you found a successful trajectory, that becomes deterministic code,” Li explains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reason the startup can do this is because its work — which Li admits is still early — is not just an LLM wrapper that sends and retrieves data to a model.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a new technology which is not used by any other agent company. We call it ‘neuro symbolic computer use agents.’ It’s not fully LLM-based,” he said. “Our approach to solve hallucinations is to let the LLM write code which becomes deterministic. So if you have a workflow that works, the next time we run the same workflow, it’ll be successful as well.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another benefit is that this deterministic code that performs a repeatable task is in the hands of the end user, not the LLM. “Once they have the code, they can trust it, because they can inspect it, they can audit it, they can see what’s going on,” Li says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Time will tell if this method is the magic that will bring agents into the hands of every worker. Li says his early beta customers include a car dealership automating VIN number searches, and HOAs extracting contract information from PDFs. And the company’s <a href=\"https://www.simular.ai/simular-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open source project</a> (available only for Mac OS at the moment) has led to automations ranging from content creation to sales and marketing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Simular previously raised a $5 million seed, bringing its total raised to about $27 million. Other investors in the company include Basis Set Ventures, Flying Fish Partners, Samsung NEXT, Xoogler Ventures, and podcaster and angel investor Lenny Rachitsky, the company says.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation. While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\">astronomical gigawatts of electricity,</a> data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), has become the de facto standard that all the majorAI apps are built to support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon did not announce a timeline for Trainium4. If Amazon follows previous rollout timelines, we’ll likely hear more about Trainium4 at next year’s conference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company announced new tools for managing AI agent boundaries, agent memory capabilities, and agent evaluation features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One upgrade is the introduction of Policy in AgentCore. This feature allows users to set boundaries for agent interactions using natural language. These boundaries integrate with AgentCore Gateway, which connects AI agents with outside tools, to automatically check each agent’s action and stop those that violate written controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Policy allows developers to set access controls to certain internal data or third-party applications like Salesforce or Slack. These boundaries can also include telling an AI agent they can automatically issue refunds up to $100 but must bring a human in the loop for anything larger, David Richardson, vice president of AgentCore, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced AgentCore Evaluations, which is a suite of 13 pre-built evaluation systems for AI agents that monitor factors including correctness, safety, and tool selection accuracy, among others. This also allows developers to have a head start in building their own evaluation features as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That one is really going to help address the biggest fears that people have [with] deploying agents,” Richardson said about the new evaluation capabilities. “[It’s] a thing that a lot of people want to have but is tedious to build.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that it’s building a memory capability into the agent platform, AgentCore Memory. This feature allows agents to develop a log of information on users over time, like their flight time or hotel preferences, and use that information to inform future decisions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Across these three things, we are continuing to iterate at the different layers at AgentCore,” Richardson said. “Talking to existing systems with Policy, [making agents] more powerful with [AgentCore Memory], helping the development team iterate with an agent.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While agents are the <em>soup du jour</em> of the AI industry right now, some people believe the technology won’t last. But Richardson thinks that the tools AgentCore is developing can withstand the fast-moving market even as trends change — which he expects they will.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Being able to take advantage of the reasoning capabilities of these models, which is coupled with being able to do real-world things through tools, feels like a sustainable pattern,” Richardson said. “The way that pattern works will definitely change. I think we feel ready for that.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\">annual enterprise tech event here</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Open-weight models release their model weights publicly so anyone can download and run them. Meanwhile, closed-source models, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, keep their weights proprietary and only provide access through APIs or controlled interfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two-year-old startup, founded by former DeepMind and Meta researchers, has raised about $2.7 billion to date at a<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/03/mistral-the-french-ai-giant-is-reportedly-on-the-cusp-of-securing-a-14-billion-valuation/\"> $13.7 billion valuation </a>— peanuts compared to the numbers that competitors like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/openai-reportedly-raises-8-3b-at-300b-valuation/\">OpenAI</a> ($57 billion raised at a $500 billion valuation) and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">Anthropic</a> ($45 billion raised at a $350 billion valuation) are pulling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Mistral is trying to prove that bigger isn’t always better — especially for enterprise use cases. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our customers are sometimes happy to start with a very large [closed] model that they don’t have to fine-tune … but when they deploy it, they realize it’s expensive, it’s slow,” Guillaume Lample, co-founder and chief scientist at Mistral, told TechCrunch. “Then they come to us to fine-tune small models to handle the use case [more efficiently].” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine tune them,” Lample continued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initial benchmark comparisons, which place Mistral’s smaller models well behind its closed-source competitors, can be misleading, Lample said. Large closed-source models may perform better out-of-the-box, but the real gains happen when you customize. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In many cases, you can actually match or even out-perform closed-source models,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mistral’s large frontier model, dubbed Mistral Large 3, catches up to some of the important capabilities that larger closed-source AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini 2 boast, while also trading blows with several open-weight competitors. Large 3 is among the first open frontier models with multimodal and multilingual capabilities all in one, putting it on par with Meta’s Llama 3 and Alibaba’s Qwen3-Omni. Many other companies currently pair impressive large language models with separate smaller multi-modal models, something Mistral has done previously with models like Pixtral and Mistral Small 3.1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large 3 also features a “granular Mixture of Experts” architecture with 41B active parameters and 675B total parameters, enabling efficient reasoning across a 256k context window. This design delivers both speed and capability, allowing it to process lengthy documents and function as an agentic assistant for complex enterprise tasks. Mistral positions Large 3 as suitable for document analysis, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/mistrals-new-devstral-model-was-designed-for-coding/\">coding</a>, content creation, AI assistants, and workflow automation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its new family of small models, dubbed Ministral 3, the company is making the bold claim that smaller models aren’t just sufficient – they’re superior. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lineup includes nine distinct, high-performance dense models across three sizes (14B, 8B, and 3B parameters) and three variants: Base (the pre-trained foundation model), Instruct (chat-optimized for conversation and assistant-style workflows), and Reasoning (optimized for complex logic and analytical tasks).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mistral says this range gives developers and businesses the flexibility to match models to their exact performance, whether they’re after raw performance, cost efficiency, or specialized capabilities. The company claims Ministral 3 scores on par or better than other open-weight leaders while being more efficient and generating fewer tokens for equivalent tasks. All variants support vision, handle 128K-256K context windows, and work across languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A major part of the pitch is practicality. Lample emphasizes that Ministral 3 can run on a single GPU, making it deployable on affordable hardware – from on-premise servers to laptops, robots, and other edge devices that may have limited connectivity. That matters not only for enterprises keeping data in-house, but also for students seeking feedback offline or robotics teams operating in remote environments. Greater efficiency, Lample argues, translates directly to broader accessibility. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s part of our mission to be sure that AI is accessible to everyone, especially people without internet access,” he said. “We don’t want AI to be controlled by only a couple of big labs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some other companies are pursuing similar efficiency trade-offs: Cohere’s latest enterprise model, Command A, also runs on just two GPUs, and its<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/coheres-new-ai-agent-platform-north-promises-to-keep-enterprise-data-secure/#:~:text=WAITLIST%20NOW,automating%20high%2Dlevel%20market%20research.\"> AI agent platform North</a> can run on just one GPU. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sort of accessibility is driving Mistral’s growing physical AI focus. Earlier this year, the company began working to integrate its smaller models into robots, drones, and vehicles. Mistral is collaborating with Singapore’s Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) on specialized models for robots, cybersecurity systems, and fire safety; with German defense tech startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/germanys-helsing-doubles-down-on-drones-for-ukraine-scales-up-manufacturing/\">Helsing</a> on <a href=\"https://helsing.ai/newsroom/helsing-and-mistral-announce-strategic-partnership-in-defence-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">vision-language-action models for drones</a>; and with automaker <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/customers/stellantis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Stellantis</a> on an in-car AI assistant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Mistral, reliability and independence are just as critical as performance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Using an API from our competitors that will go down for half an hour every two weeks — if you’re a big company, you cannot afford this,” Lample said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With more competition in the market, companies often need to sell TVs at a discounted price with lower margins.

Titan OS aims to use data insights from users and its vast content portfolio to reduce that time. Across the OS, users have access to a mix of broadcast TV, streaming apps that they subscribe to, along with FAST (free ad-supported television) channels from Titan OS’s partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the company, revenue opportunity lies in a few key areas. First, it partners with many FAST services to help them reach the local audience. Second, there are advertising opportunities on the home screen of the TV and during streams that reach millions of users. The company said its content partners are eager to reach new audiences through advertising, especially event-heavy content channels that show sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Titan OS also offers shoppable ads that have customers perform actions like scanning a QR code to buy an item. The startup said that through these areas, it has grown 10x in revenue in two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While TV makers like Sony might not shed their core operating system, they are keen to partner with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sony.eu/presscentre/titan-os-partners-with-sony-europe-to-bring-free-and-premium-fast-channels-to-selected-sonys-android-tvs\">companies like Titan OS to offer more FAST channels</a> to their customers. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/ctv-advertising-more-than-makes-up-dip-hardware-sales\">Multiple</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/televisions/wondering-why-your-smart-tv-has-so-many-ads-manufacturers-are-struggling-to-make-money-on-hardware?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reports</a> suggest that for TV makers, advertising is becoming a more lucrative revenue-earning option than hardware itself. Titan OS COO Edwards buys into this ethos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It used to be the case that hardware manufacturers made most of their profit from selling the device itself. But now, some hardware manufacturers that have their own operating system make more profit from ongoing content and advertising revenues than they do from actually selling the hardware. And this is a big change,” he told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we offer them [TV companies] is an ability to generate ongoing content and advertising revenues after the device is sold, which is not the status quo in the market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Edwards said that, to expand the company’s footprint in Europe, the company is bolstering its portfolio of local language ad-supported channels catered to each geography. With this strategy, the startup, which competes with the likes of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.whaletv.com\">Whale TV</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://xperi.com/solutions/tivo/\">Xperi’s TiVO</a>, offers over 100 channels in these markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently has 200 people across three offices in Barcelona, Amsterdam, and Taipei. The additional funding will help Titan OS bolster the staff across product and sales, work on new partnerships, and create new advertising projects. The company aims to maintain its growth curve and raise additional funding next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laurance Garrett, a partner at Highland Europe, equated Titan OS with WeTransfer, the VC firm’s investment that was acquired by Bending Spoons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Titan OS, there is the beauty of the advertising model on top of the actual core OS.  It was something we could identify with [from their experience with WeTransfer], and the partners loved it,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Garrett added that with Titan OS’s European roots, the company can better understand the nitty-gritty of the local market as compared to players coming in from abroad.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This comes in addition to a recent directive ordering smartphone manufacturers to preinstall the government’s Sanchar Saathi app on all new handsets and push it onto existing devices through a software update.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/india-orders-mobile-phones-preloaded-with-government-app-ensure-cyber-safety-2025-12-01/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported</a> the news on Monday, which was later <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2197140&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed</a> by the ministry in a public statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1924552\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Launched in 2023</a>, the Sanchar Saathi portal allows users to block or trace lost and stolen phones. The system has blocked more than 4.2 million devices and traced 2.6 million more devices, per government data. The system expanded earlier this year with the <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/dot-launches-sanchar-saathi-mobile-app-to-crack-down-on-fraud-communications-101737101357197.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">release</a> of a dedicated Sanchar Saathi app in January, which the government says helped recover more than 700,000 phones, including 50,000 in October alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Sanchar Saathi app has since gained broad adoption. The app has been downloaded nearly 15 million times and saw more than three million monthly active users in November — up more than 600% from its launch month, according to marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Web traffic to Sanchar Saathi has also surged, with monthly unique visitors rising by more than 49% year-over-year, per Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government’s order to pre-install Sanchar Saathi has already drawn significant backlash from privacy advocates, civil society groups, and opposition parties. Critics argue the move <a href=\"https://x.com/apar1984/status/1995801634501226731\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expands state visibility into personal devices</a> without adequate safeguards. The Indian government, however, says the mandate is intended to address rising cases of cybercrime, such as IMEI duplication, device cloning, fraud in the second-hand smartphone market, and identity theft scams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/JM_Scindia/status/1995772731455926362\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Responding to the controversy</a>, telecom minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia said on Tuesday that Sanchar Saathi is “a completely voluntary and democratic system” and that users can delete the app if they do not wish to use it. The directive reviewed by TechCrunch — and circulating on social media on Monday — instructs manufacturers to ensure the pre-installed app is “readily visible and accessible to end users at the time of first use or device setup” and that “its functionalities are not disabled or restricted,” raising questions about whether the app is truly optional in practice.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deputy telecom minister Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar <a href=\"https://x.com/aseemmanchanda/status/1995824109465600365\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> in media interviews that most major manufacturers were included in the government’s working group on the initiative, though Apple did not participate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside pushing the Sanchar Saathi app, the telecom ministry is piloting an application program interface — or API — that would allow recommerce and trade-in platforms to upload customer identities and device details directly to the government, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The move would mark a significant step toward creating a nationwide record of smartphones in circulation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s used-smartphone segment is expanding rapidly as rising prices of new devices and longer replacement cycles push more consumers toward cheaper alternatives. India <a href=\"https://www.ccsinsight.com/blog/the-rise-of-indias-second-hand-smartphone-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">became the world’s third-largest market</a> for second-hand smartphones in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as much as 85% of the second-hand phone sector remains unorganized, meaning most transactions occur through informal channels and through brick-and-mortar stores. The government’s move covers only formal recommerce and trade-in platforms, leaving much of the broader used-device market outside the scope of the current measures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While announcing the pre-installation of its app, the Indian government said the move would help enable “easy reporting of suspected misuse of telecom resources.” Privacy advocates say that the growing data flows could give authorities unprecedented visibility into device ownership — raising concerns over how the information could be used or misused.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a troubling move to begin with,” said Prateek Waghre, head of programs and partnerships of Toronto-based nonprofit policy lab, Tech Global Institute, told TechCrunch. “You’re essentially looking at the potential for every single device being ‘databased’ in some form. And then what uses their database can be put to it at a later date, we don’t know.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government has not yet detailed how the collected data will be stored, who will have access to it, or what safeguards will apply as the system expands. Digital rights groups say the sheer scale of India’s smartphone base — estimated at some 700 million devices — means even administrative changes can have outsized consequences, potentially setting precedents that other governments may study or replicate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While the intent behind a unified platform may be protection, mandating a single government-controlled application risks stifling innovation particularly from private players and startups who have historically driven secure, scalable digital solutions,” said Meghna Bal, director at New Delhi-based technology think tank, Esya Centre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the government intends to build such systems, they must be backed by independent audits, strong data governance safeguards, and transparent accountability measures. Otherwise, the model not only puts user privacy at stake, but also removes fair opportunity for the ecosystem to contribute and innovate,” said Bal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The planned API also raises concerns for recommerce firms, which could face liability if sensitive customer information is mishandled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian telecom ministry did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waghre noted that while the Sanchar Saathi app is visible on a user’s phone, the broader system it connects to operates largely out of sight. The permissions, data flows, and backend changes, including the planned API integration, may be buried in long-term-and-conditions documents that most people never read, he said. As a result, users may have little practical understanding of what information is being collected, how it is shared or the extent of the system’s reach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can’t go about restricting cybercrimes and device thefts in such a disproportionate and heavy-handed way,” said Waghre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The government is basically saying that, look, you need to put my app on every device that is sold, on every existing device, you have to install it, and in anything that’s being resold as well,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It was founded just a few months ago, in September, 2025, by Kyutai founding member Neil Zeghidour, who cut his teeth working with voice models as a researcher at Google DeepMind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s goal, it says, is to make voice models speedier and more accurate for developers. And, as a European startup, it launched with multilingual support out of the gate: English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, with additional languages coming. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, Gradium is entering a race with plenty of competition. For starters, the frontier LLM companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/openai-upgrades-its-transcription-and-voice-generating-ai-models/\">OpenAI,</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/anthropic-launches-a-voice-mode-for-claude/\">Anthropic</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/\">Meta Llma</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/voxtral\">Mistral</a> all have voice, speech recognition, and multimodal models. Then there are well-funded startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/elevenlabs-ceo-says-ai-audio-models-will-be-commoditized-over-time/\">ElevenLabs</a>, and hundreds of voice/speech models on Hugging Face. Right now, there’s no shortage of options for a developer needing AI voice capabilities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the need for what Gradium hopes to offer — ultra-realistic voice expression and accuracy — will only grow over time, as AI moves from typed chats to AI agents and expands into use cases from entertainment to work.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The deal uses funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act and represents the first Chips Act award in President Trump’s second term, though it remains preliminary and subject to change.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previous government equity investments under the Trump administration include publicly traded companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/u-s-government-plans-to-take-a-10-stake-in-intel/\">Intel</a>, MP Materials, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/u-s-government-takes-stake-in-canadian-lithium-miner-and-its-nevada-mining-project/\">Lithium Americas</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/10/07/trilogy-metals-shares-skyrocket-250-in-premhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/10/07/trilogy-metals-shares-skyrocket-250-in-premarket-as-trump-acquires-stake/arket-as-trump-acquires-stake/\">Trilogy Metals</a>.

At TechCrunch’s signature Disrupt event back in October, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/sequoias-roelof-botha-warns-founders-about-chasing-sky-high-valuations-as-the-firm-doubles-down-on-its-selective-approach/\">jokingly offered</a> what might be the understatement of the year when asked about the trend: “[Some] of the most dangerous words in the world are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other VCs have similarly expressed concerns, if quietly, about what it means when their portfolio companies are suddenly competing against startups backed by the U.S. Treasury, or even when they find themselves sitting across the table from government representatives at board meetings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The four-year-old, Palo Alto, California, company at the center of this particular experiment is trying to do something genuinely audacious in semiconductor manufacturing. XLight wants to build particle accelerator-powered lasers — machines the size of a football field, mind you — that would create more powerful and precise light sources for making chips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If it works, it could challenge the near-total dominance of ASML, the Dutch giant that has been publicly traded since 1995 and currently enjoys an absolute monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. (Its shares have surged 48.6% this year.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CEO of xLight is Nicholas Kelez, a quantum computing and government labs veteran who presumably knows his way around a particle accelerator. Helping this venture as executive chairman is Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who was shown the door late last year after his ambitious manufacturing revival plans failed to materialize.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I wasn’t done yet,” Gelsinger — who is also a general partner at Playground Global, which led the startup’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-startup-xlight-raises-40-million-race-against-china-key-chip-making-laser-2025-07-22/\">$40 million</a> funding round this summer — told the Journal, adding that the effort is “deeply personal” to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, xLight doesn’t just want to compete with ASML but to go much further. While ASML’s machines work at wavelengths around 13.5 nanometers, xLight is targeting 2 nanometers. Gelsinger claims the technology could boost wafer processing efficiency by 30% to 40% while using far less energy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it happens, both Kelez and Gelsinger will be holding forth at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event on Wednesday night in Palo Alto, where the government’s backing will no doubt come up. (You can still <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/strictlyvc-palo-alto/\">nab a seat here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, for his part, insists this is all in service of national security and technological leadership, saying the partnership could “fundamentally rewrite the limits of chipmaking.” Critics will continue to question whether taxpayer-funded equity stakes represent visionary industrial policy or state capitalism with a patriotic sheen, though even skeptics acknowledge the geopolitical reality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At least Botha, who described himself at Disrupt as a “sort of libertarian, free market thinker by nature,” conceded that industrial policy has its place when national interests demand it. “The only reason the U.S. is resorting to this is because we have other nation states with whom we compete who are using industrial policy to further their industries that are strategic and maybe adverse to the U.S. in long-term interests.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He’ll stick around through spring as an adviser.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His replacement is Amar Subramanya, a highly regarded Microsoft executive who spent 16 years at Google, most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant. It’s a savvy hire, given that Subramanya knows the competition intimately.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move is being characterized as a shake-up. It was seemingly inevitable in retrospect. Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to the ChatGPT moment, has been stumbling since its October 2024 launch. Reviews have ranged from “underwhelming” to outright alarmed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its first months were some of the roughest. A notification summary feature meant to condense multiple alerts into digestible snippets generated a series of embarrassing, untrue headlines in late 2024 and early 2025. Among other missteps, the BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v778x85yo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complained twice</a> after Apple Intelligence falsely reported that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself (he hadn’t) and that a darts player, Luke Littler, won a championship before the final <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27zwp7jpxo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">even began</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there was Siri’s promised overhaul, which became a black eye for Apple. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg investigation</a> published in May revealed the depths of Apple’s AI struggles. For instance, when Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, tested the new Siri on his own phone just weeks before its planned launch in April, he was dismayed to find that many of the features the company had been touting didn’t work. The launch was delayed indefinitely, triggering class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers who’d been promised an AI-powered assistant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By that point, Giannandrea had already been sidelined, according to Bloomberg. The news organization reported that Tim Cook had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/apple-puts-vision-pro-exec-in-charge-of-siri-in-exec-shakeup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stripped Siri</a> from Giannandrea’s oversight entirely back in March, handing it to Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. Apple removed its secretive robotics division from Giannandrea’s control, too.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg’s investigation painted a picture of organizational dysfunction, with weak communication between AI and marketing teams, budget misalignments, and a leadership crisis severe enough that some employees had taken to mockingly calling Giannandrea’s group “AI/MLess.” The report also documented an exodus of AI researchers to competitors, including OpenAI, Google, and Meta.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly now leaning</a> on Google’s Gemini to power the next version of Siri, an astonishing and, presumably, humbling twist considering the intense rivalry between the two companies that dates back more than 15 years, across mobile operating systems, app stores, browsers, maps, cloud services, smart home devices, and now AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Giannandrea came to Apple from Google, where he ran Machine Intelligence and Search. At Apple, he oversaw the AI strategy, machine learning infrastructure, and Siri development.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now Subramanya inherits those responsibilities, reporting to Federighi with a clear mandate to help Apple catch up in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an interesting moment for the company. While competitors have been pouring billions of dollars into massive AI data centers, Apple has focused on processing AI tasks directly on users’ devices using its custom Apple Silicon chips, a privacy-first approach that avoids collecting user data. (When more complex requests require cloud processing, Apple routes them through Private Cloud Compute, servers that promise to process data temporarily and delete it immediately.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether that philosophy pays off or whether it has permanently left Apple behind is an outstanding question. Apple’s approach comes with clear trade-offs. Among them, on-device models are smaller and less capable than the massive models running in competitors’ data centers, and Apple’s reluctance to collect user data has left its researchers training models on licensed and synthetic data rather than the giant troves of real-world information that fuel its rivals’ systems.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SwNPqsOXkk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">episode</a> of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/what-is-google-gemini-ai/\">Gemini</a> was still known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/googles-bard-chatbot-can-now-tap-into-your-google-apps-double-check-answers-and-more/\">Bard</a>. More recently, it <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/deep-research-workspace-app-integration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">began pulling personal data</a> into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/30/gemini-will-now-automatically-summarize-your-long-emails-unless-you-opt-out/\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/googles-gemini-can-now-help-you-schedule-google-calendar-meetings/\">Calendar</a> and Drive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as Google integrates more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/googles-bard-chatbot-can-now-tap-into-your-google-apps-double-check-answers-and-more/\">personal data</a> into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/google-maps-bakes-in-gemini-to-improve-navigation-and-hands-free-use/\">location history</a>, and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That, Stein said, would be “much more useful” than just showing users a more generic list of the best-selling products in a given category. “That is, I think, very much the vision — of building something that can be really knowledgeable for you, specifically.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This idea isn’t all that different from how the “Others” in the hit Apple TV show “Pluribus” have gobbled up the world’s knowledge, including intimate details about individuals. When the system interacts with the show’s protagonist, Carol, it uses that data to personalize everything: cooking her favorite meals, adopting a familiar face to handle its communications with her, and otherwise anticipating her needs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Carol doesn’t find the personalized responses kind; she finds them invasive. She never consented to sharing her data with the hivemind, yet it knows her better than she’d like.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, it seems that avoiding Google’s data-gobbling ways will get increasingly difficult in the AI era, and if Google doesn’t get the balance right, the results could feel more creepy than useful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(To be clear: Google <em>does</em> let you control the apps Gemini uses to make its AI more knowledgeable about you specifically — it’s under “Connected Apps” in Gemini’s <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">settings</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you do share app data with Gemini, Google <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?dark=1&amp;sjid=17783156566859743275-NA&amp;visit_id=639002230735023711-3962094755&amp;ref_topic=15294201&amp;rd=1#pn_connected_apps\">says</a> it will save and use that data according to the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?dark=1&amp;sjid=17783156566859743275-NA&amp;visit_id=639002230735023711-3962094755&amp;ref_topic=15294201&amp;rd=1#pn_connected_apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gemini privacy policy</a>. And that policy reminds users that human reviewers may read some of their data and not to “enter confidential information that you wouldn’t want a reviewer to see or Google to use to improve its services.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as more data gets ingested into Google’s own hivemind, it’s easy to see how AI could make data privacy more of a gray area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, however, believes it has a solution of sorts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stein says that Google will indicate when its AI responses are personalized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think people want to intuitively understand when they’re being personalized — when information is made for them, versus when [it’s] something that everyone would see if they were to ask this question,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stein noted, too, that Google could send a push notification to users when a product they had been considering after several days of online research becomes available or is on sale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are all these ways that Google now, across modes, across kind of different aspects of your life, [is] being incredibly helpful to you…” he said. “And I think that’s more of how I think of the future of search than any one specific feature or single form factor.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just over a year after adding climate risk scores, Zillow has removed them from more than 1 million listings after real estate agents complained that the information was causing them to lose sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zillow first added the data to the site in September 2024, <a href=\"https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-09-26-Zillow-introduces-First-Streets-comprehensive-climate-risk-data-on-for-sale-listings-across-the-US#:~:text=Zillow%20introduces%20First%20Street's%20comprehensive,the%20US%20-%20Sep%2026,%202024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">saying</a> that more than 80% of buyers consider climate risks when purchasing a new home. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But last month, following objections from the California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS), Zillow removed the listings’ climate scores. In their place is a subtle link to their records at First Street, the climate risk analytic startup that provides the data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When buyers lack access to clear climate-risk information, they make the biggest financial decision of their lives while flying blind,” First Street spokesperson Matthew Eby told TechCrunch via email. “The risk doesn’t go away; it just moves from a pre-purchase decision into a post-purchase liability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First Street’s climate risk scores first appeared on Realtor.com in 2020, where they remain. They  also still appear on Redfin and and Homes.com.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York-based startup has raised more than $50 million from investors including General Catalyst, Congruent Ventures, and Galvanize Climate Solutions, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Art Carter, the CRMLS CEO, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/climate/zillow-climate-risk-scores-homes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told</a> The New York Times that “displaying the probability of a specific home flooding this year or within the next five years can have a significant impact on the perceived desirability of that property.” He also questioned the accuracy of First Street’s data, saying he didn’t think that areas which haven’t flooded in the last 40 to 50 years were likely to flood in the next five.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t the first time real estate agents have complained about climate risk scores. Last year, when Zillow introduced the feature, one agent in Massachusetts told the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/10/17/science/zillow-climate-change-risk-scores-massachusetts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Boston Globe</a> that the risk scores were “putting thoughts in people’s minds about my listing that normally wouldn’t be there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First Street defended its data. “Our models are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science and are continuously validated against real-world outcomes,” Eby said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the CRMLS coverage area, during the Los Angeles wildfires, our maps identified over 90 percent of the homes that ultimately burned as being at severe or extreme risk — our highest risk rating — and 100 percent as having some level of risk, significantly outperforming CalFire’s official state hazard maps,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Official hazard maps have been criticized in recent years for either being out of date or underestimating a property’s level of risk. Nearly twice as many properties carry a 1% annual risk of flooding — a so-called 100-year flood — than are listed on Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood maps, which are used to designate which properties are required to carry flood insurance, according to a <a href=\"https://kinder.rice.edu/urbanedge/outdated-and-inaccurate-fema-flood-maps-fail-fully-capture-risk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Louisiana State University analysis</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The real estate and insurance industries have been racing to keep up with worsening weather wrought by climate change. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If buildings are on fire or underwater, they don’t have much value,” Peter Gajdoš, partner at proptech venture capital firm Fifth Wall, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/why-the-next-big-entrepreneur-must-come-from-climate-tech/\">wrote</a> for TechCrunch four years ago. “We are discussing these issues with large insurers and the interest is unprecedented.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors, insurers, and cities are likely to continue using data from companies like First Street to determine where climate risks lie. In offering homebuyers access to the same data, Zillow helped level the playing field. But thanks to the objections of real estate agents, consumers have one more hoop to jump through.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for millions of businesses to build and manage online stores. The company <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/online-shopping-trends-ecommerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> Shopify merchants handle over 10% of all e-commerce transactions in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issues began surfacing around 6:45 a.m. PT, when select merchants reported difficulties logging into their Shopify accounts. Additionally, many faced challenges accessing point-of-sale (POS) systems, preventing them from processing transactions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shopify’s status page recently confirmed that the company had identified and remedied the cause of the problem: its login authentication flow, which explains the POS login complications. Shopify stated that it’s now seeing signs of recovery and that it will continue monitoring the situation. It also advised merchants that its Help Center was experiencing longer-than-normal wait times for support as a result of today’s outage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exact number of affected merchants is unclear. However, <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/shopify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Downdetector</a>, a website that tracks user-submitted reports about website issues, noted there were about 4,000 outage incidents.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
