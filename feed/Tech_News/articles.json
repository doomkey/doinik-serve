He now makes over $100,000 annually. “I pinch myself going to work every day,” the 51-year-old tells the Journal. In Oregon, electrical safety specialist Marc Benner pulls in $225,000 a year, while electrician Andrew Mason makes over $200,000 managing workers at six Northern Virginia data centers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Journal reports this isn’t just about higher base pay. Companies are sweetening the pot with perks like heated break tents, free lunches, daily incentive bonuses, and even remote project management positions. One construction site offers workers $100 in daily incentive pay, which can add up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The surge comes as tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to build hundreds of new data centers, colliding with an industry-wide shortage of roughly 439,000 skilled workers, according to the Associated Builders and Contractors trade group. </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Much of that growth will occur in more rural areas as facilities grow in size and as sites near urban areas become scarce, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/ai-and-the-power-grid-where-the-rubber-meets-the-road/\">BloombergNEF said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Driving part of the growth is the sheer scale of planned data centers. Today, only 10% of data centers draw more than 50 megawatts of electricity, but over the next decade, the average new facility will draw well over 100 megawatts. The biggest sites help skew the data: Nearly a quarter will be larger than 500 megawatts, and a few will exceed 1 gigawatts. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?w=680\" alt=\"A chart illustrating data center electricity use through 2032.\" class=\"wp-image-3071402\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png 4555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=1200,762 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=1280,813 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=430,273 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=720,457 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=900,571 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=800,508 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=1536,975 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=2048,1300 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=668,424 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=591,375 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=972,617 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=708,450 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BloombergNEF-data-center-forecast-12-1-2025.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Planned data centers are significantly larger than those currently in operation.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>BloombergNEF</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, the utilization rate for all data centers is expected to grow from 59% to 69% as AI training and inference grows to nearly 40% of total data center compute.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some ways, the findings in the new report aren’t surprising. AI companies have been racing to build more powerful data centers, helping to drive global investment in the facilities up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/data-centers-now-attract-more-investment-than-finding-new-oil-supplies/\">$580 billion this year</a>. That’s more than the world spends finding new supplies of oil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the new report shows just how quickly the landscape is changing. It is a sharp revision upwards from a document the group published in April. The upswing was driven by a surge in new projects that have been announced since then. “With an average seven-year timeline for projects to come online, developments in earlier stages affect the tail end of our forecast the most,” the new report said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early stage projects have more than doubled between early 2024 and early 2025, though those are distinct from projects that have been committed or are currently under construction. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of that new capacity is being planned for Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey. They lie within a region known to industry experts at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJM_Interconnection\">PJM Interconnection</a>, a regional transmission organization that’s tasked with operating the electrical grid in those states and others, including Delaware, West Virginia, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. Texas’s Ercot grid will see a large number of additions, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The report arrives as the PJM Interconnection is under scrutiny from its independent monitor, Monitoring Analytics. The group filed a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20251125-5275&amp;optimized=false&amp;sid=53de8368-82a1-4e72-a2c3-b9a3fbc0073c\">complaint</a> with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) saying that PJM has the authority to authorize new data center connections only when its grid has adequate capacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As part of its obligation to maintain reliability, PJM has the authority to require large new data center loads to wait to be added to the system until the loads can be served reliably,” Monitoring Analytics wrote. “PJM has the authority to create a load queue.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, data centers are responsible for today’s high electricity prices within the region, the organization said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“PJM’s failure to clarify and enforce its existing rules and to protect reliable and affordable service in PJM is unjust and unreasonable,” it said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By design, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on public blockchains that allow law enforcement, as well as blockchain intelligence firms such as Chainalysis and Elliptic, to follow the money over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Authorities said they seized $25 million euros ($29 million) in bitcoin, along with three servers, 12 terabytes of data, and the official domain <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cryptomixer.io\">cryptomixer.io</a>, which now displays the customary law enforcement seizure splash page. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Europol, the site “facilitated the obfuscation of criminal funds for ransomware groups, underground economy forums and dark web markets,” and claimed its software “blocked the traceability of funds on the blockchain.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Deposited funds from various users were pooled for a long and randomised period before being redistributed to destination addresses, again at random times. As many digital currencies provide a public ledger of all transactions, mixing services make it difficult to trace specific coins, thus concealing the origin of cryptocurrency,” Europol said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cryptomixer offered customers anonymity, such as providing cover for cybercriminals who wanted to launder their crypto before taking the funds to legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges. Europol said the “cleaned” cryptocurrency could be swapped for other cryptocurrencies or fiat cash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, authorities have shut down or sanctioned several similar services, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/treasury-tornado-cash-laundering-stolen-crypto/\">Tornado</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/two-founders-behind-russian-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash-charged-by-u-s-federal-courts/\">Cash</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-seizure-over-28-million-cryptocurrency-cash-and-other-assets\">Chipmixer</a>, and others.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Originally designed to add holiday lights to your <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/holiday-app-festivitas-puts-xmas-lights-on-your-mac/\">Mac’s desktop,</a> this popular indie app has been updated this year with several new features, most notably a version of the app that brings its sparkling, colorful lights to iOS devices for the first time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new Festivitas app for iPhone and iPad, you can add and customize a string of holiday lights on your device’s Home Screen using iOS widgets. The lights can frame your favorite personal photo (or perhaps a holiday image you dig up on Pinterest), and you can opt to make the widget transparent so it blends in with your background.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071349\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=555,1200 555w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=592,1280 592w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=199,430 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=333,720 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=416,900 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=370,800 370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=309,668 309w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=285,617 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=245,531 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While seasonal apps can sometimes be low-quality cash grabs, developer Simon Støvring puts genuine effort and thoughtfulness into Festivitas’ design — and doesn’t charge an arm and a leg, either. Instead, the app is available for free to consumers, with premium features that can be unlocked for a fair price of between $3.99 and $9.99. (You get to choose the price that works best for you.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On both macOS and iOS, you can customize the holiday lights in multiple ways, beyond picking their colors and flashing pattern. You can adjust the cable’s thickness, its drop width and height, and choose from pre-made color palettes like Candy Cane, Winter Snow, Elf, and others, or you can design your own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also make finer adjustments to things like the colors’ hue or temperature, the speed of the flashes, and the spacing between the lights.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/light-settings.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071355\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another perk is that you’ll be able to use the lights again outside of the winter holidays, as you can now change the bulb shape to designs like a bat, clover, Easter egg, heart, ghost, star, “2026,” and more throughout the year. This lets you continue to enjoy the app for other holidays and special events — there’s even a “WWDC” bulb for celebrating Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another new feature this year is a snow effect for the Mac app, which adds floating snowflakes to your desktop. You can customize this experience, making the flakes gently drift down toward your dock, or increase the snow amount, fall speed, flake size, and wind, transforming it into what looks like a blizzard. You can also choose to have the snow fall on top of everything on the screen, or just on your desktop itself.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/snow-settings.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071352\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both the snow and lights can react to your mouse as you move it across the screen, either repelling the snow or lifting and dropping the lights, for a bit of interactive fun. Plus, moving the lights up makes it easier to see your browser tabs when you need to click them, though you can turn this feature off if you prefer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’re more technically inclined, you’ll appreciate the app’s Shortcuts integration that lets you automate when your lights and snow turn on. This lets you do things like trigger the snow based on the day’s forecast, or have the lights appear alongside your music, and more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071353\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp 1876w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=768,543 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=680,481 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=1200,848 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=1280,905 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=430,304 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=720,509 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=900,636 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=800,565 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=1536,1086 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=668,472 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=531,375 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=873,617 873w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=708,500 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Festivitas-shortcuts.webp?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are plenty of other apps that offer holiday <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/how-to-customize-your-iphone-home-screen-for-ios-26s-liquid-glass/\">themes, widgets, and icons</a> for your iPhone, but there’s a whimsy to Festivitas that makes it worth the download for anyone who’s into Home Screen or desktop personalization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By releasing early, Deezer beats other streaming music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, in providing an annual summary of listeners’ favorite songs, artists, albums, and genres for 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature, called “My Deezer Year,” offers users a detailed overview of their top tracks, top artists, favorite albums, and the amount of time spent listening to their most-played artist and their best track. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year’s edition introduces a new “romantic comedy” theme for the recap’s visual presentation. According to Deezer, as users explore their listening habits, they’ll feel as if they’re starring in a romantic comedy, complete with scenes like a “meet cute.” Deezer narrates the story as users navigate through it, teasing plot twists along the way.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071276\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=300,102 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=768,262 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=680,232 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=430,147 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=720,246 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=900,307 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=800,273 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=668,228 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=708,242 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=50,17 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Deezer</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The experience is divided into three episodes. The first episode, titled “Meet Cute,” highlights the new artists users discovered throughout the year. The second episode, “Love Triangle,” features users’ top three artists, while the final episode, “Happily Ever After,” showcases their favorite tracks, along with a personalized playlist for continued listening. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year’s experience differs last year’s “My Deezer Year 2024,” which offered a different interactive approach, inviting users to choose between being “roasted” or “hyped up” based on their music preferences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to previous years, this year’s recap also includes a personalized quiz where users can answer compatibility questions based on their musical tastes and share results with friends to find their musical matches. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071277\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=768,316 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=680,280 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=430,177 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=720,296 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=900,371 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=800,329 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=668,275 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=708,291 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Deezer</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, users can create their own quizzes to share with others by entering their favorite genre, three songs, and a top artist, then see which friends match their preferences. Notably, this is the first year non-Deezer users can create their own quizzes, a move likely intended to encourage more people to download the app and share their experiences on social media.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My Deezer Year 2025” is now available in the app on iOS and Android devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deezer also released some interesting statistics, highlighting that on average, Deezer users listened to 122.8 hours of music globally over the past year, streaming over 691 songs from 402 artists, and discovering 357 new tracks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In the U.S., Amazon sessions that resulted in a purchase surged 100% on Black Friday compared with the trailing 30 days, while sessions that resulted in a purchase and didn’t include Rufus increased by only 20%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Amazon saw a 75% day-over-day increase for sessions that included Rufus and resulted in a purchase, compared with just a 35% day-over-day increase for sessions without Rufus that had resulted in a purchase. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm also noted that Amazon sessions that involved the AI chatbot outpaced total website sessions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Black Friday, Amazon’s total website sessions increased by 20% day over day, while those that involved Rufus were up by 35%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s AI chat was first launched into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/amazon-debuts-rufus-an-ai-shopping-assistant-in-its-mobile-app/\">beta in early 2024</a> before rolling out to all U.S. customers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/amazon-ai-chatbot-rufus-is-now-live-for-all-u-s-customers/\">later that year</a>. Today, Rufus helps Amazon shoppers find products, get recommendations, and perform product comparisons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rufus’ adoption to drive Black Friday sales is part of a broader surge in consumers turning to AI to help them with holiday shopping, data shows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-05-at-5.18.22%E2%80%AFPM-e1709677222431.png?w=680\" alt=\"Amazon Rufus\" class=\"wp-image-2675035\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to e-commerce data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday. This indicates that consumers more heavily embraced generative AI chatbots to find deals and research products this year. The AI tools were mostly used for popular Black Friday deal categories like electronics, video games, appliances, toys, personal care items, and baby and toddler products. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe Analytics also noted that the use of AI increased conversions. It found U.S. shoppers who came to a retail site from an AI service were 38% more likely to buy, compared with non-AI traffic sources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether AI directly contributed to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/black-friday-sets-online-spending-record-of-11-8b-adobe-says/\">record Black Friday spending</a> of $11.8 billion is less clear. Instead, the sizable figure this year could be due to higher prices, not an increase in online shopping. As TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/black-friday-sets-online-spending-record-of-11-8b-adobe-says/\">reported</a> on Saturday, Salesforce data showed prices were up by an average of 7%, while order volumes were down by 1%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sensor Tower’s data similarly suggests that consumers were perhaps being more conservative in their spending this year, likely due to economic strains. Even though mobile app and website adoption spiked on Black Friday compared to the previous 30 days, gains in total visits and downloads decelerated from 2024, its data indicated. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Amazon and Walmart’s mobile app downloads grew by 24% and 20%, respectively on Black Friday, compared with the previous 30 days. But that growth paled when compared with 2024, when Amazon downloads surged by 50% and Walmart’s were up 75% during the same period, the firm pointed out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon and Walmart’s website visits on Black Friday were up by 90% and 100% this year, respectively, compared with the prior 30 days. However, those same numbers in 2024 were 95% and 130%, also respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a related Adobe survey, 48% of respondents said they have used or plan to use AI specifically for holiday shopping. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At that point, about a year ago, he felt he was ready to find investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I literally made a list of the top five media investors in the world,” Joseph recalled. His product uses AI to help companies track what the world says about them and their competitors in the press, across podcasts, and in social media. So he wanted investors who understood that scene. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Cuban, who has founded media networks, starred on “Shark Tank,” written books, produced movies, and is regularly interviewed on TV, was at the top of Joseph’s list. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So,<strong> </strong>one evening in late 2024, Joseph drank a beer for courage and sent a one-page investment pitch via cold email to everyone on the list. No warm intro.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cuban, alone, answered. It turns out, busy and inundated with pitches as he is, Cuban still scans his own emails. He’s always looking for his next deal. “I have literally invested tens of millions of dollars from emails, and a lot of them have paid off, turned into unicorns,” Cuban tells TechCrunch about why he answered Clipbook.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before Cuban cracked open his checkbook, he put Joseph through a series of tests. His first email response “was the most skeptical 20 questions that he could ever ask,” Joseph recalled. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cuban admits he’s fairly famous for that from “Shark Tank.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I start to pepper them, they wilt, right? They wilt or they get angry at a certain level,” Cuban explained. “It’s their baby. They don’t like to be questioned, yeah? But Adam was just like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After answering every question to Cuban’s satisfaction, the billionaire then asked Joseph to prove the product by producing a report for Cuban’s own baby: <a href=\"https://www.costplusdrugs.com/medications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CostPlus Drugs</a>. That’s an online pharmacy and public benefit corporation he co-founded in 2022 that prices drugs affordably at cost plus 15%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know what a pain in the ass it is to do the research for PR and for marketing, and to learn about [competitor] companies, and to find out what people are saying about your own company,” Cuban explained. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2774370\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not that Clipbook doesn’t have plenty of competitors that also do this work. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/sprinklr/\">Sprinklr</a> is among the best known, but others include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/26/tiktok-partners-hootsuite-sprinklr-emplifi/\">Sprout Social, Emplify,</a> Hootsuite, and more.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph contends that Clipbook is different because it was built from the ground up to be AI native. That means it doesn’t just scan for keywords, but it understands the context of how those words are used. It knows that media references to “cost” and “drugs” is not the same as looking for CostPlus Drugs. It knows the difference between any person named “Adam Joseph” and the one who is the founder of Clipbook. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being AI-native (not an AI bolt-on) also helps it search where other products struggle to go, such as audio and video references in podcasts, Joseph contends. He built this product after doing PR work for Boston Consulting Group and so experienced the pain of media sentiment research firsthand, he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph speedily produced the report for Cuban that really “nailed” relevant references, Cuban says. He was especially impressed when it unearthed a previously unknown podcast conversation about pharmacy benefit services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a few days of negotiating, Cuban agreed to send Joseph a term sheet. The first part of that seed round closed in early 2025 and other investors piled in over the next few months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph declined to share updated ARR figures with TechCrunch from since his seed round closed — except to say the company has grown since its first million. But the company now counts 200 companies as customers, including Weber Shandwick and his old employer, the Boston Consulting Group, he says.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The <a href=\"https://www.varda.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Varda Space Industries</a> CEO predicts that within 10 years, someone could stand at a landing site and watch multiple specialized spacecraft per night zooming toward Earth like shooting stars, each carrying pharmaceuticals manufactured in space. Within 15 to 20 years, he says, it will be cheaper to send a working-class employee to orbit for a month than to keep them on Earth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reason Bruey thinks these scenarios are realistic is because he has watched ambitious business projections unfold before, while working as an engineer at SpaceX.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I remember the first rocket I worked on at SpaceX was flight three of Falcon 9,” he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSqd1QxYAdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said at TechCrunch’s recent Disrupt event</a>. The partially reusable, two-stage, medium-lift launch vehicle has since completed nearly 600 successful missions. “If someone had told me ‘reusable rockets,’ and ‘[we’ll see as] many [of these] flights as daily flights out of LAX,’ I would have been like, ‘All right, [maybe in] 15 to 20 years,’ and this feels the same level of futuristic.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda has already proven the core concept. In February 2024, after a months-long regulatory odyssey, the company became only the third corporate entity ever to bring something back from orbit — crystals of ritonavir, an HIV medication — joining SpaceX and Boeing in that exclusive club. It has completed a handful of missions since.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company brings its pharmaceuticals back to Earth inside the W-1 capsule, a small, conical spacecraft about 90 centimeters across, 74 centimeters high, and weighing less than 90 kilograms (roughly the size of a large kitchen trash can). The company this week <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/varda-space-launches-its-fifth-mission-extends-run-of-afrl-test-flights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched its fifth capsule</a> ever aboard a SpaceX ride-share mission, hosted by a spacecraft bus that provides power, communications, propulsion, and control while in orbit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So why manufacture crystals in space? In microgravity, the usual forces that interfere with crystal formation on Earth — like sedimentation and gravity pulling on growing crystals — essentially disappear. Varda says that this gives it much more precise control over crystallization, allowing it to create crystals with uniform sizes or even novel polymorphs (different structural arrangements of the same molecule). These improvements can ostensibly translate into real benefits: better stability, greater purity, and longer shelf life for drugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The process isn’t quick. Pharmaceutical manufacturing can take weeks or months in orbit. But once it’s complete, the capsule detaches from the spacecraft bus and plunges back through Earth’s atmosphere at over 30,000 kilometers per hour, reaching speeds above Mach 25. A heat shield made of NASA-developed carbon ablator material protects the cargo inside, and a parachute brings it down for a soft landing.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The actual business is pretty prosaic, though, Bruey offered. “Forget about space for a second,” he said. “We just have this magic oven . . . where you can create formulations that you otherwise couldn’t.” Added Bruey of what people often get wrong about Varda, the company isn’t “in the space industry; we’re in-space industry,” he said. Space is “just another place to ship to.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Worth noting: Varda isn’t discovering new drugs or creating new molecules. It’s aiming to expand the menu of what can be done with existing, approved drugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t speculative science, either. Companies like Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck have been running pharmaceutical crystallization experiments on the International Space Station for years, proving the concept works. Varda says it’s just making it commercial by building the infrastructure to do it repeatedly, reliably, and at a scale that might actually matter to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for why now, two things have changed. First, space launches have become bookable and predictable. “Ten years ago, you would have to get a chartered flight. It was like hitchhiking to get to orbit if you were not a primary mission payload,” Bruey explained. “It’s still expensive today, but [it’s] dependable, you can book a slot, and we [have] booked launches years in advance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Second, end-to-end space service companies like Rocket Lab started producing satellite buses that could be purchased off the shelf. Buying <a href=\"https://rocketlabcorp.com/missions/upcoming-missions/varda-space-industries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spacecraft from Rocket Lab</a> and integrating its pharmaceutical manufacturing capsules with them is a major unlock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, only the highest-value products make economic sense. That’s why Varda started with pharmaceuticals; a drug that can command thousands of dollars per dose can absorb the transportation costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The “seven domino” theory</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Bruey talks to members of Congress, which he says he does frequently these days, he pitches what he calls the “seven domino theory.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Domino one: reusable rockets. Done. Domino two: manufacturing drugs in orbit and returning them. Domino three is the big one: getting a drug into clinical trials. “It’s a big deal because what it means is perpetual launch.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is where Varda’s business model diverges fundamentally from every other space company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Think about how satellite companies work. SiriusXM launches satellites to broadcast radio. DirecTV launches satellites to transmit television. Even Starlink, with its thousands of satellites, is fundamentally building out a constellation — a network that, once complete, doesn’t require constant launches to function. These companies treat launch as a capital investment. They spend money to place hardware in orbit, and then they’re done.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda is different. Each drug formulation requires manufacturing runs. Manufacturing runs require launches. More demand for the drugs means more launches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This matters because it changes the economics for launch providers. Instead of selling a fixed number of launches to build out a constellation, they have a customer with (theoretically) unlimited demand that grows with success. That kind of predictable, scalable demand helps justify the fixed costs of launch infrastructure and drives down per-launch prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Domino four triggers the feedback loop: As Varda scales, costs drop, making the next tier of drugs economically viable. More drugs mean more scale, lowering costs again — a cycle Bruey says will “shove launch costs into the ground.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda’s commercial viability remains unproven, and no space-manufactured drugs are currently on pharmacy shelves. But the virtuous cycle Bruey imagines won’t just benefit Varda. Lower launch costs make space accessible for other industries, including semiconductors, fiber optics, and exotic materials — everything that benefits from microgravity but can’t yet justify the expense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Bruey tells his team, launch costs will get so low that it will be cheaper to put an employee in orbit for a month because creating additional automation would cost more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I imagine ‘Jane’ goes to space for a month. It’ll be like [heading to] an oil rig. She works at the drug factory for a month, comes back down, and [becomes] the first person ever to go to space and back where she generate[s] more value than the cost to take her there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s at that moment, Bruey says, when “the invisible hand of the free market economy lifts us off our home planet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The near-death experience</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The path to those shooting star drug deliveries nearly ended before it began, Bruey told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda launched W-1 in June 2023 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 ride-share mission. The pharmaceutical manufacturing process inside the capsule worked as planned, producing crystals of Form III ritonavir, a specific crystalline structure of the drug that’s difficult to create on Earth. The experiments were completed within weeks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But then the capsule just . . . stayed in orbit. For six months. The problem wasn’t technical, Bruey said; Varda couldn’t get approval to bring its W-1 capsule home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Utah Test and Training Range, where Varda wanted to land, exists to “test weapons and train warriors,” as Bruey put it. Space drugs didn’t fall into that category, so Varda wasn’t a priority customer. When higher-priority military missions needed the range, they bumped Varda’s scheduled landing windows. Each bump invalidated the company’s reentry license with the FAA, requiring it to start the approval process over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There were 80 people in the office who had spent two and a half years of their lives on this thing, and it’s in orbit, but we’re not sure if it can come home,” Bruey recalled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The situation looked bad from the outside. To observers, it seemed like Varda had been reckless and launched without proper approvals. But he said in reality, the FAA had authorized Varda to launch without a finalized reentry license because the agency wanted to encourage the nascent commercial reentry industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They encouraged us to proceed with our launch, with the goal being that we would continue to coordinate that license, as well as the use of reentry timing with the range, while we were in orbit,” Bruey explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The real problem was that this was the first commercial land reentry ever attempted. There was no established process for the Utah range to coordinate with the FAA. Both entities felt like they were shouldering all the liability.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda explored every alternative it could think of. Water landing? The capsule doesn’t float; they’d lose it. Australia? Possible, and they started those conversations. But Bruey says he made a call: no half measures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Either you have to push the boundaries of regulation to create this future, or you don’t,” he said. “In order for Varda to be successful, we need to land on land regularly. So we just sucked it up and said, ‘Let’s figure this one out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While its first mission remained stranded in orbit, the company continued production on the next capsule. It kept hiring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February 2024, eight months after launch, W-1 finally came home. It landed as originally planned at the Utah Test and Training Range, the first commercial spacecraft to land on a military test range and the first to land on U.S. soil under the FAA’s Part 450 licensing framework, introduced by the agency in 2021 to make commercial space operations more flexible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now Varda has landing sites in both the U.S. and Australia, and it’s the first company to receive an FAA Part 450 operator license that lets it reenter the U.S. without resubmitting full safety documentation for each flight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Varda has a secondary business that emerged from necessity: hypersonic testing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Very few objects ever travel through the atmosphere at Mach 25. The environment at those speeds is extreme and unique: Temperatures reach thousands of degrees, creating a plasma sheath around a vehicle. The air itself undergoes chemical reactions as molecules are ripped apart and recombine. This environment can’t be replicated on Earth, even in the most advanced wind tunnels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Air Force and other defense agencies need to test materials, sensors, navigation systems, and communications equipment in real hypersonic conditions. Traditionally, that would require dedicated test flights that cost upwards of $100 million each and involve significant risk.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda offers an alternative. Its W-1 capsules are already reentering at Mach 25. The company can embed sensors, test new thermal protection materials, or validate equipment in the actual flight environment rather than in approximations. The capsule is akin to a wind tunnel, and the reentry is the test.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda has already flown experiments for the Air Force Research Laboratory, including an optical emission spectroscopy payload that took in-situ measurements of the shock layer during reentry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors are, big surprise, excited about Varda’s story. The company raised $329 million as of its Series C round this past July, most of it earmarked for building out the company’s pharmaceutical lab in El Segundo. It’s also hiring structural biologists and crystallization scientists to work on more complex molecules, eventually including biologics like monoclonal antibodies, which Bruey says is a $210 billion market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A whole lot has to go right between then and now for Varda to elbow its way into that business, as well as to make a dent in the business it’s currently targeting. But if Bruey is right, “then” is closer than most people might right now imagine.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts — <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/ahead-of-trump-crypto-fundraiser-warren-questions-government-ethics-agency-on-crypto-czar-david-sacks-conflicts-of-interest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said earlier this year</a> that Sacks “simultaneously leads a firm invested in crypto while guiding the nation’s crypto policy,” an “explicit conflict of interest” that would “normally” be prohibited under federal law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the NYT’s story (under the headline “Silicon Valley’s Man in the White House Is Benefiting Himself and His Friends,” and credited to five bylined reporters) seems to offer a more comprehensive view, with an analysis of his financial disclosures suggesting that among Sacks’ 708 tech investments, 449 are AI companies that could benefit from the policies he supports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sacks has received two White House ethics waivers declaring he would sell most of his crypto and AI assets. However, the NYT said his public ethics filings do not disclose the remaining value of his crypto and AI investments, nor do they say when he sold off the assets he divested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor specializing in government ethics, made similar points in July after reviewing Sacks’ crypto waiver, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/19/david-sacks-and-the-blurred-lines-of-government-service/\">telling TechCrunch</a>, “This is graft.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NYT also said that Sacks’ filings classify hundreds of investments as hardware or software, rather than AI, while the companies pitch themselves as AI businesses in their marketing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To illustrate Sacks’ “intertwined interests,” the NYT pointed to the White House summit in July where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trump-is-set-to-unveil-his-ai-roadmap-heres-what-to-know/\">Trump unveiled his AI roadmap</a> — White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reportedly stepped in to prevent the All-In podcast (which Sacks co-hosts) from being the only host of the event. And All-In asked potential sponsors to pay $1 million for access to a private reception and other events, the NYT claimed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NYT also reported that Sacks became close with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this spring and has played a role in removing restrictions on Nvidia chip sales around the world, including in China.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right-wing media personality and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/the-maga-verses-clash-of-titans?srsltid=AfmBOoomltlKj_VDs5eRRIVqGjfrG5SARtT68ccr-AuSAyEX1d45tah7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made no secret</a> of his animosity toward some of Trump’s Silicon Valley allies) said Sacks is emblematic of an administration where “the tech bros are out of control.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sacks’ spokesperson Jessica Hoffman told the NYT that “this conflict of interest narrative is false.” Hoffman said Sacks has complied with the rules for special government employees, that the Office of Government Ethics determined which investments he had to sell, and that his role in the government has cost him, rather than benefited him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Sacks has been “an invaluable asset for President Trump’s agenda of cementing American technology dominance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sacks’ post responding to the NYT includes a letter written to the newspaper from Clare Locke, a law firm that Sacks hired, claiming that the reporters had been given “clear marching orders: find and report on a conflict of interest between Mr. Sacks’ duties in the White House and his background in the private technology sector.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter also addresses some of the specifics of the NYT story, including the All-In podcast’s role in the White House AI event. Sacks’ lawyers said the AI summit was a not-for-profit event, and that the All-In podcast “lost money hosting the event.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Two sponsors were brought on to help partially defray the cost of the event, for which they received nothing but logo placements,” the letter said. “No access to President Trump was ever offered, and no VIP reception ever took place.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Charlie Warzel <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/chatgpt-third-anniversary/685084/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in The Atlantic</a> that we are now living in “the world ChatGPT built,” which is “defined by a particular type of precarity” and is “perpetually waiting for a shoe to drop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Young generations feel this instability acutely as they prepare to graduate into a workforce about which they are cautioned that there may be no predictable path to a career,” Warzel said. “Older generations, too, are told that the future might be unrecognizable, that the marketable skills they’ve honed may not be relevant.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, others feel more optimistic about an AI-centric future, and indeed are positioned to profit from it handsomely. But in Warzel’s telling, the AI boosters and investors are waiting along with everyone else — waiting to see if their bets pay off, but also waiting “because a defining feature of generative AI, according to its true believers, is that it is never in its final form.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Bloomberg took a more focused look at <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/three-years-of-ai-mania-how-chatgpt-reordered-the-stock-market?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM5MjMxMiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTk3MTEyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNjFBTEJUOTZPU1MwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwNEFGQkMxQkYyMTA0NUVEODg3MzQxQkQwQzIyNzRBMCJ9.ypePZpUZJoUcwg5_H5vuFwHDCIgYQSi_-fuuRO42B_k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">how ChatGPT has transformed the stock market</a>.

But AI fever has also buoyed other Big Tech companies, with the seven most valuable companies on the S&amp;P 500 — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Broadcom — all tied to tech, and with their collective growth accounting for nearly half of the benchmark’s 64% increase since ChatGPT was launched.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has made for a more top-heavy market. The S&amp;P 500 is weighted based on market capitalization, and those same seven companies now account for 35% of the weighting, compared to around 20% three years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How long will this growth last?

After a pilot phase from February, the drones have been fully operational for the last two months in Espoo, where they depart from a launchpad that’s shared with delivery-only grocery store Wolt Market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the end users, this means that they can order different food styles from Huuva’s partner brands, and add some groceries, too — each drone can carry around 4.4 pounds, and Manna can send two of them at once. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071200\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This adds another layer of convenience, but also speed. Unlike drivers, drones won’t get stuck in traffic at lunch time. According to Leppälä, this is key to making sure the food arrives fresh; and it doesn’t hurt if unit economics are more sustainable for Huuva, too. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huuva’s team estimates that regular deliveries currently cost €5-6 each (approximately $6-8), while drone deliveries could get down to €1 ($1.16). That’s not accounting for the extra costs that Manna may be incurring from setting up its Finnish operations, although the weather wasn’t as challenging as it might have been for a newcomer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coming from Ireland, Manna’s drones were already thoroughly tested for wind and rain, in such quantities that snow also falls under the same umbrella. Icing does present an extra challenge, but according to local operations and maintenance lead Makar Nalimov, in those cases they’ll just use other delivery methods, especially since using chemicals for de-icing is also out of the question when food is involved.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gif-Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-e1764517902262.gif?w=462\" alt=\"Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025\" class=\"wp-image-3071195\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These fallback options highlight that Manna’s drones are part of a fast-expanding range of last-mile delivery solutions. Wolt itself is already using sidewalk robots from <a href=\"https://www.ottomate.news/p/coco-robotics-heads-to-helsinki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Coco</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGBdWW7RCYT/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Starship</a> in Finland, and its parent company DoorDash even built its own, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/doordash-unveils-dot-its-autonomous-robot-built-to-deliver-your-food/\">Dot</a>, which started performing deliveries in Arizona earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid rumors that DoorDash may be <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nate-andorsky_doordash-is-building-their-own-drone-delivery-activity-7392234808875171840-SuzQ/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">building its own drone delivery program</a>, in addition to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/wing-and-doordash-launch-drone-deliveries-in-dallas-fort-worth/\">collaborating with Alphabet-owned Wing</a>, direct partnerships could be beneficial to companies like Manna and Huuva. The food startup is considering an expansion to another Espoo location where Wolt Market would be out of the equation, which would make it possible for the launchpad to be close enough to the kitchen for deliveries to be handed over through a window.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the current process, Manna’s launchpad sits within a short distance; delivery workers on e-scooters pick up the orders from the kitchen in a heat bag, then carry it over to Manna’s operators. Under maintenance lead Nalimov’s supervision, they put the orders on a scale and balance the weight if needed before placing them into special bags approved by regulators.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-14-rotated-e1764517329246.jpg?w=435\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071202\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resistant bags are only one of many safety measures that Manna follows to comply with regulations and its own procedures. For instance, batteries are systematically swapped so that drones always fly with a full charge. According to Nalimov, there’s also redundancy at all levels, plus preparedness for different incident scenarios — and a parachute as a last resort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Manna has staff on the ground, Mission Control sits in Ireland. There, operators assess the lidar maps, review the planned flight itinerary, and drop a pin for the drone to deliver within a short radius of the customer’s location. If conditions aren’t met, the order falls back to a courier. If approved, the drone captures an image of the landing spot for final human confirmation before lowering the package with biodegradable rope. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This process has now become routine for Manna’s local staff, which is getting busier. According to Nalimov, he and his team are now handling double-digit deliveries a day, and are confidently gearing up for their first operational winter in Finland. As for Huuva, it is now ready to double down on drone deliveries in Espoo, with one extra wish: being allowed to put its logo on those regulator-sanctioned bags.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Between 10am and 2pm, online shoppers were supposedly spending $12.5 million every minute. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2025/11/29/black-friday-data-shows-online-sales-strong-store-results-mixed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Forbes reports</a> that Adobe said in a statement that the numbers show Black Friday has become “a major e-commerce moment, as more shoppers opt to stay home and take advantage of deals.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company projects that Cyber Monday (coming in two days, on December 1) will be even bigger, with $14.2 billion spent online, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/us-consumers-spent-118-billion-black-friday-says-adobe-analytics-2025-11-29/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Black Friday data from companies like Adobe and Salesforce can provide an early indicator of broader holiday shopping trends. Adobe is projecting a total of $253.4 billion in holiday spending this year, compared to $241.1 billion in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce said it tracked $79 billion in global spending on Black Friday, with $18 billion of that in the United States, year-over-year increases of 6% and 3%, respectively. But this growth may have less to do with increased consumer demand and instead reflecting higher prices — Salesforce data also shows that prices were up an average of 7%, while order volumes were down 1%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And both Adobe and Salesforce claim to see a growing influence of AI on holiday shopping. For example, <a href=\"https://x.com/salesforce/status/1994825232008298633\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Salesforce said</a> that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales, though it’s not clear how broadly that’s defined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The data is less clear about how online trends compare to in-person shopping at brick-and-mortar stores, with RetailNext telling Forbes that in-store traffic appears to be down 3.4% nationwide, while Pass_by said foot traffic is up 1.17% overall, and up an even more impressive 7.9% in department stores.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
