And while robotaxis have become commonplace in the San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Los Angeles, autonomous trucks are absent because regulations ban any driverless vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds from testing on public roads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agency, which has considered lifting the ban for a couple of years now, released a draft of the proposed changes in 2024. The final proposed revisions were released Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revised regulations cover a few areas beyond self-driving trucks, including language that appears to give law enforcement the power to issue traffic tickets to driverless vehicles — an issue that has received more attention as Waymo has expanded its commercial robotaxi operation in the state. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The self-driving trucks component is by far the most contentious. The revisions reflect feedback received during the initial public comment period this spring, the agency said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proposal was met with enthusiasm by companies developing autonomous vehicle technology, many of which are based in California, but test on highways in other states like Texas. Companies like Aurora Innovation and Kodiak AI eventually want to use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/aurora-expands-self-driving-trucks-route-to-el-paso/\">self-driving trucks to carry freight</a> along commerce-heavy freeways across states. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The California DMV’s latest draft regulations show real progress toward creating a regulatory framework for driverless trucks in the state and unlocking coast-to-coast autonomous operations,” Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, said in an emailed statement. “These proposed regulations are a critical step towards bringing autonomous trucks to California freeways in 2026, a milestone that will enhance road safety and grow the economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Teamsters Union, which has fought to protect truck drivers, is unmoved. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our position remains the same, we are opposed to the deployment and testing of this technology on our roads,” Shane Gusman, the legislative director for Teamsters California, told TechCrunch. “The changes that are made don’t change our position.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gusman noted that the Teamsters will fight the proposed revisions. It’s also lobbying for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB33\">passage of AB 33</a>, a bill currently on the state Senate floor, which would require a human safety operator behind the wheel of any heavy duty autonomous truck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV’s revised rules would require self-driving trucks companies to go through a phased permitting process, mirroring current regulations applied to light-duty autonomous vehicles like robotaxis. Companies would first receive a permit to test with a human safety operator behind the wheel. The DMV issues separate permits for driverless testing and deployment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Manufacturers would be required to conduct testing for a minimum number of miles prior to applying for a driverless testing permit and a deployment permit, under the DMV rules. For instance, self-driving truck companies would need to complete a minimum of 500,000 autonomous test miles — 100,000 of which must occur in the intended operational design domain in California — before it will receive a driverless permit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV also proposed revising rules that would affect light-duty autonomous vehicles too. For instance, the regulations would expand the frequency and type of data reported to the department during testing and deployment and require companies to update plans on interacting with first responders on a more regular basis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before she was a VC, Masha Bucher worked in PR and marketing – an experience that has shaped the way she runs Day One Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After years of working in communications – including executive roles that gave her deep insight into how startups operate – Bucher realized she could either use her business acumen to become one of the most effective PR reps in the game, or evolve into something more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was seeing what was going on in business, and because I could understand the context, I understood business, and because I understood business, my PR pitches would be very business focused,” Bucher told TechCrunch on today’s episode of Equity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She founded Day One Ventures in 2018 after realizing she could create more impact – and make better returns – by investing in startups and providing them with integrated PR support. By combining these two functions, she could help portfolio companies more meaningfully while backing only the stories she truly believed in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The structure of PR services is very misaligned,” Bucher said, noting that PR firms working on a contract basis often lean toward working slower so they can stretch out client payments. “For startups, it’s really important to move fast.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond speed, there’s a cost barrier: “Early-stage companies shouldn’t be paying  $10-, $20- or $30-grand per month for six months to get one announcement in TechCrunch. I just don’t think that’s fair, and I don’t think it’s sustainable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Day One’s integrated model allows Bucher to work with startups at critical early stages when they need support most. Younger startups might pivot or experience founder shakeups, and “you need to be trusted to advise and help them make decisions.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backing a company financially gives her something many traditional PR firms can’t offer: she’s literally invested in the story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have an ambition to be, ideally, the first investor in the most important and ambitious ideas and companies of our time,” Bucher said. “I think that starts with you understanding the field, understanding the business, getting a conviction on the business. And once you have this conviction – which you’ve proved by investing in the company – you have the right to introduce it to reporters with much higher integrity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Someone in PR who gets access to everything from investor decks to a startup’s data room has serious advantages in positioning the company and understanding what’s at stake. And for Bucher, it makes the work more compelling. Doing PR for whatever companies are big enough to pay might be good business, “but that doesn’t mean it’s a good story.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with any VC, Bucher answers to her investors – in Day One’s case, more than 70 LPs including institutions, individuals, and more than 15 of the firm’s own portfolio founders. That means her bets need to be carefully considered. When Bucher chooses companies, she’s not only asking whether she wants to see their vision become reality, but whether the founder has the ethics and moral compass to maintain their values as the company scales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She points to Valar Atomics, a startup developing advance nuclear reactors, as an example. Day One <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/10/nuclear-startup-valar-atomics-raises-130-million.html\">co-led a $130 million round</a> into the startup last month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I can’t think of a better founder,” she said, referring to Valar’s CEO Isaiah Taylor, noting she trusts him with “literally life-and-death” decisions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That moral filter means there are companies she wouldn’t back, even if they’re getting hype. Bucher said she wasn’t swayed by AI startup Cluely’s rage-bait “cheat on everything” marketing strategy. Rather, she’s proud to have invested in some of the most innovative technologies in areas like reproductive tech (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.orchidhealth.com/\">Orchid’s</a> embryo selection technology), accessible healthcare (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://superpower.com/?srsltid=AfmBOook08N1SgXG4iVTDvxlWKNNMJcRxLx4dMEiu8WjpSoSWpDSEmim\">Superpower</a>), and law-enforcement software (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abelpolice.com/\">Abel’s</a> AI-optimized report-writing tools).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Day One’s portfolio includes early bets on companies like Sam Altman’s World, the email app Superhuman, and the remote work platform Remote.com, with at least 12 unicorns under its belt and $115 billion-plus in portfolio value. Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/vc-queen-masha-bucher-largest-fund-150m/\">Day One closed its Fund III with $150 million</a>, targeting early-stage founders “solving humanity’s most pressing issues,” and has grown over the last six years from $11 million in assets under management to well over $450 million today, says Bucher.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to use comms to solve companies’ business goals, unlock new opportunities, and to help them, ultimately, to grow shareholder value,” Bucher said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/snowflake-anthropic-expanded-partnership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$200 million multi-year AI deal</a> that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform and, consequently, to its sizable customer base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in the blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It’s a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic in October signed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/deloitte-goes-all-in-on-ai-despite-having-to-issue-a-hefty-refund-for-use-of-ai/\">deal with Deloitte</a> to bring its Claude chatbot to the consulting giant’s employee base of more than 500,000 staff. That same week, Anthropic struck a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-and-ibm-announce-strategic-partnership/\">partnership with IBM</a> to bring some of its LLMs into the latter’s software products.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s enterprise success isn’t surprising as the company’s models have garnered strong and growing traction among enterprises. A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">Menlo Ventures survey</a> in July found that enterprises preferred Anthropic’s AI products over models by other AI companies.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The European Commission on Thursday <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2896\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp in October <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">changed its business API policy</a> to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Meta is found guilty of breaching EU’s antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp, for its part, called the EU’s claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies’ chatbots. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins.

Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abhishek Sharma, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars or around $1 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus, which operates with an eight-member investment team, began with a $100 million fund and has kept its fund size at $700 million since <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/tech/funding/nexus-venture-partners-closes-its-largest-ever-fund-at-700-million/articleshow/98329133.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launching Fund VII in 2023</a>. It typically raises every 2.5 to 3 years. Bhattacharjee said the reason for keeping the eighth fund the same size was the firm believes $700 million is the right amount for its early-stage strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though India’s AI journey is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not as advanced as the U.S.’s</a> in many areas, Nexus believes India could leapfrog in several parts of the AI ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bhattacharjee underlined the country’s large talent pool, rising digital infrastructure, and demand for localized models that support India’s many languages and service needs. These dynamics, he said, are pushing Indian startups to build AI applications and agents faster, often atop open-source tools and emerging domestic AI infrastructure companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partners pointed to companies backed by Nexus, such as Zepto and Neysa, to illustrate how AI is taking shape in India. They said Zepto, the quick-commerce platform, uses AI extensively across its operations — from customer support to routing and fulfillment — demonstrating how consumer businesses are becoming deeply AI-native. Besides, infrastructure players like Neysa are emerging to address India-specific needs, including sovereign AI workloads, localized data handling and support for the country’s many languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus did not share fund metrics. The partners said its funds have been realizing significant enough returns over the years to largely fill this fund from returning limited partners. The firm’s LP base spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Japan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This year, people around the world were most curious about everything from <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/what-is-hot-honey-11716837\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hot honey</a> and AI chatbots to the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before we get into the specifics, it’s worth noting that Google’s report doesn’t reflect the overall most popular searches. If it did, the list would be filled with general terms like “weather” rather than trending topics. Instead, Google’s “Year in Search” highlights queries that saw a sustained spike in traffic in 2025 compared with 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That being said, the top trending search of the year was “Gemini,” which is Google’s AI chatbot, followed by “India vs England” and “Charlie Kirk.” Gemini wasn’t the only AI chatbot to make the list, as DeepSeek ranked seventh among the year’s trending searches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, Google says Charlie Kirk was the top trending news topic, with the query “Charlie Kirk assassination” leading the list. The second and third trending news queries were “Iran” and “US Government Shutdown,” respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for recipes and food, the top spot went to the sweet-and-spicy condiment hot honey, while Marry Me Chicken and chimichurri rounded out the top three.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For movies, the top trending search was “Anora” followed by “Superman” and the “Minecraft Movie.” The top trending search for actors went to “Anora” star Mikey Madison. Lewis Pullman, who starred in Marvel’s “Thunderbolts,” took the second spot, followed by Isabela Merced, who was featured in “Superman.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of sports, “FIFA Club World Cup” was the top trending search, followed by “Asia Cup” and “ICC Champions Trophy.” The top searched sports team was Paris Saint-Germain F.C., while the second and third were S.L. Benfica and the Toronto Blue Jays, respectively. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for podcasts, the top trending search was “The Charlie Kirk Show,” followed by Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” and “This is Gavin Newsom.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For books, the top trending search was for Colleen Hoover’s “Regretting You.” Rebecca Yarros’ “Onyx Storm” and Naveesa Allen’s “Lights Out” rounded out the top three. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can check out the full report <a href=\"https://trends.withgoogle.com/year-in-search/2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">here</a>. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as HubSpot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Formerly known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/frances-sendinblue-an-all-in-one-digital-marketing-platform-raises-160m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sendinblue</a>, Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a <a href=\"https://www.brevo.com/blog/becoming-brevo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new name</a> reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&amp;M.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After joining the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/the-age-of-the-centaur-100m-arr-is-the-new-cloud-valuation-milestone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">centaur club</a> in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting <a href=\"https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Delivers-Record-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results-Driven-by-Agentforce--Data-360/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$41.55 billion</a> in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured. (Brevo claims “double-digit EBITDA margin.”)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These coffers have already supported Brevo’s plans to <a href=\"https://www.maddyness.com/uk/2025/02/17/brevo-to-invest-e50m-in-ai-over-five-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invest €50 million in AI</a> over five years and to use <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/11/2793572/0/en/Brevo-Acquires-WonderPush-and-Octolis.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquisitions</a> (11 to date) as one of its growth levers. The 1,000-employee company now intends to use its new funding to support these two endeavors, alongside its push in the U.S., on which it plans to spend over €100 million, according to a press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brevo didn’t disclose the exact valuation resulting from its latest round. It did give more details on its updated cap table. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rumors had described the deal <a href=\"https://pe-insights.com/general-atlantic-and-oakley-capital-near-e1bn-acquisition-of-crm-software-firm-brevo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as Brevo getting acquired</a>, but Thiberge said Brevo’s management and employees still hold the largest share (26%) while new entrants General Atlantic and Oakley Capital each bought 25%; existing investors Bpifrance and Bridgepoint collectively retained 24%, while <a href=\"https://it.sendinblue.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/06/SendinBlue_Release_Funding-091217-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Series A lead Partech</a> completed its exit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This makes for a global cap table that mirrors Brevo’s stated ambition to “build a global European CRM leader capable of competing with U.S. players through product excellence.” In other words, not through playing the European sovereignty card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Thiberge, “whoever has the best product wins, and it’s a race to see who can make the product that is both the most complete and the easiest to use.” There’s an inherent tension to doing this, and to catering both to mid-market companies and very small businesses. “I’m not saying it’s easy every day … but for us, this combination has been incredibly successful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To serve this diverse audience, Brevo has significantly expanded beyond its email marketing roots. While it still competes with Mailchimp in that space, the company now offers an all-in-one platform with marketing automation, CRM, customer data management, and communication across email, SMS, WhatsApp, live chat, push notifications, and even integrated sales calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These functionalities are also increasingly boosted by AI, either through integrations or in-house. Expanding this feature set is one driver of Brevo’s M&amp;A strategy, but inorganic growth from buying competitors in key markets is the other. With acquisitions expected to contribute 45% of its €1 billion revenue target for 2030, the company’s shopping list should be extensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated to correct cap table details.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. <br><br>“We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent.

Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier. <br><br>For instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure.

The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.duckbillhq.com/blog/aws-database-savings-plans-six-years-of-complaining-finally-pays-off/\">in his blog post</a>, “Six years of complaining finally pays off.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-t-get-a-better-deal-than-free-amazon-hopes\">Can’t get a better deal than free, Amazon hopes  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Is there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year’s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/amazon-hopes-to-jump-start-its-ai-coding-tool-kiro-by-giving-it-away-to-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+</a> to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-training-chip-and-nvidia-compatibility\">An AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS introduced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new version of its AI training chip</a> called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expanded-agentcore-capabilities\">Expanded AgentCore capabilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-announces-new-capabilities-for-its-ai-agent-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform</a>. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-nonstop-ai-agent-worker-bee\">A nonstop AI agent worker bee</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-nova-models-and-services\">New Nova models and services</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-launches-new-nova-ai-models-and-a-service-that-gives-customers-more-control/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">four new AI models</a> within its Nova AI model family — three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS’s big pitch is flexibility and customization.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lyft-s-argument-for-ai-agents\">Lyft’s argument for AI agents</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/aws-and-lyft-bringing-agentic-ai-to-life-for-riders-and-drivers\">piped up during the event</a> to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-factory-for-the-private-data-center\">An AI Factory for the private data center</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced “AI Factories”</a> that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Dye will focus on improving AI features in these devices and report directly to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Apple, Dye will be replaced by Steve Lemay, who has had “a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,” according to a statement Apple CEO Tim Cook gave Bloomberg.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems that Meta is recruiting from its competitors to help the company compete in the AI race, as Meta also poached researchers from OpenAI this summer. (Allegedly, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hand-delivered homemade <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-soup-story-openaai-employee-recruiting-attempt-2025-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">soup</a> to an OpenAI employee in a recruitment push; OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen said that he has since delivered his own soup to promising Meta recruits.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after the news broke of Dye’s departure, Zuckerberg <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DR0Wsy0EhCP\">announced</a> a new creative studio within Reality Labs that would be led by Dye. There, he’ll be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another former Apple designer who led interface design across Reality Labs; Joshua To, who led interface design across Reality Labs; Meta’s industrial design team, led by Pete Bristol; and its metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg said the studio would “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered,” the Meta CEO wrote on Threads. “We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated after publication with additional information about Meta’s plans.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/25/mrbeast-1-5-billion-valuation-youtuber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.5 billion valuation</a> left some onlookers incredulous — but Beast Industries ended up <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mrbeast-revealed-ownership-stake-beast-industries-feastables-2025-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raising at a $5 billion valuation last year</a>. Now we’re asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s getting to the point where even if you don’t have a child under the age of 15, you should know who MrBeast is. The North Carolinian Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast channel has over 450 million YouTube subscribers — more than any other YouTube channel — making him arguably the most successful social media star ever. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So it made sense when at the DealBook Summit, reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin asked MrBeast and Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, about going public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You want to have an IPO at some point, I imagine,” said Sorkin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At some point, we want to be able to give the 1.4 billion unique people around the world who has watched Jimmy’s content the last 90 days a chance to be owners of the company,” Housebold replied. Sounds pretty much like a yes, as we can’t imagine another practical way to give ownership stakes to over a billion people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other major creators, the MrBeast business expands <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/youtubers-arent-relying-on-ad-revenue-anymore-heres-how-some-are-diversifying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">far beyond YouTube ad revenue</a> and into a company called Beast Industries. Its biggest moneymaker is Feastables chocolate, which is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/mrbeast-makes-more-money-from-feastables-chocolate-than-youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more profitable</a> than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Housenbold also mentioned that Beast Industries plans to build a two-sided marketplace for creators and marketers to work together (this idea has been explored by many creator economy startups already). Plus, the company is planning to launch a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/mrbeast-reportedly-plans-to-launch-a-phone-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">phone company</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mrbeast-moving-beyond-youtube-financial-services-2025-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">financial services platform</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/mr-beast-theme-park-beast-land-saudi-arabia-lsff6t2b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">theme park</a> in Saudi Arabia.

Beast Industries is in an ongoing lawsuit with the ghost kitchen Virtual Dining Concepts for damaging his brand by selling “inedible” food from MrBeast Burger. Virtual Dining Concepts <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/mr-beast-sued-burger-company-100-million-1235689127/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">countersued</a> him for allegedly breaching his contract.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, after filming the first season of “Beast Games,” five contestants <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mrbeast-amazon-sued-beast-games-contestants-class-action-1236148181/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sued</a> Donaldson and Amazon for alleged mistreatment and sexual harassment on set. The heavily redacted lawsuit states that the show filmed in an environment that “systematically fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In conversation at DealBook, Donaldson said, “The big thing is, obviously, I learned why people don’t have 2,000 people compete in a show, because you’re creating a scenario where 1,999 aren’t happy, because they didn’t win … I don’t know how openly I’m allowed to speak, but obviously, yes, some people sue you. I’m sure people in here have been sued before because they just want to try to make money.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Housenbold cut in, “Listen, we’re always learning and getting better.” He was interrupted by laughter from the crowd. “Mistakes are part of success, so Season 2 is a lot better.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not that Beast Industries’ missteps would prevent it from going public eventually, especially if it moves past them and can build the management discipline needed to bear the scrutiny of being public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Donaldson wouldn’t be the first creator-run business to go public — but he could pull off the first creator IPO that actually works. The esports team FaZe Clan went public in a $725 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SPAC</a> but got <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23925149/faze-clan-gamesquare-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquired</a> a year later in 2023 for just $17 million. In November, Pinkfong — the company that made the most-watched YouTube video, “Baby Shark” — went public in Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“From day one, we’re a global media company, and now we’re working on monetizing that viewership, that fandom, and that trust we built,” Housenbold said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The platform hosts various interest-based and affinity communities, including military roleplaying games and LGBTQ solidarity groups. But Russia has laws designating public LGBTQ advocacy as “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/06/30/russia-rising-toll-of-lgbt-extremism-designation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">extremist activity.</a>“</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a translation of an article in <a href=\"https://tass.ru/obschestvo/25806963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TASS</a>, a state-owned Russian news agency, Russia’s communications agency cited the presence of LGBTQ content on the platform as one of the reasons behind the ban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the ban this afternoon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ban comes as Roblox faces broader safety and moderation challenges. Recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> have highlighted how the platform exposed some of its underage users to child predators.

(However, facial verification technology comes with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/06/the-growing-debate-over-expanding-age-verification-laws/\">safety concerns</a> of its own.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox has also <a href=\"https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-to-our-maturity-compliance-questionnaire/3860056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asked</a> developers to flag experiences that “are primarily themed on a sensitive social, political, or religious issue” so that the parents of users under 13 years old can decide if their children can access that content.

Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium <a href=\"https://x.com/ajassy/status/1996066784252969450\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on X</a> that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said the Trainium2 business “has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bedrock is Amazon’s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jassy said Amazon’s AI chip is winning among the company’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those “other GPUs” out there on the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That is, of course, Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/amazons-growing-private-label-business-is-challenge-for-small-brands.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">classic MO</a>, offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight in an <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/aws-tranium3-ai-is-the-best-inference-platform-in-the-world-ceo-says?page=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">interview with CRN</a>, about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it’s Anthropic.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,” Garman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Project Rainier is Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. It came <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-project-rainier-ai-trainium-chips-compute-cluster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">online in October</a>. Amazon is, of course, a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-invests-additional-4-billion-anthropic-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">major investor in Anthropic</a>. In exchange, Anthropic made AWS its primary model training partner, even though Anthropic is now also offered on Microsoft’s cloud <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-nvidia-and-anthropic-announce-strategic-partnerships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">via Nvidia’s chips. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is now also using AWS in addition to Microsoft’s cloud. But the OpenAI partnership couldn’t have contributed much to Trainium’s revenue because AWS is running it on Nvidia chips and systems, <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-open-ai-workloads-compute-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the cloud giant said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, only a few U.S. companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have all the engineering pieces — silicon chip design expertise, homegrown high-speed interconnect. and networking technology — to even attempt true competition with Nvidia. (Remember, Nvidia cornered the market on one major high-performance networking tech in 2019 when CEO Jensen Huang outbid <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/nvidia-to-buy-supercomputer-chipmaker-mellanox-for-6-9b-beating-intel-in-a-bidding-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Intel and Microsoft to buy InfiniBand hardware maker Mellanox</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, AI models and software built to be served up by Nvidia’s chips also rely on Nvidia’s proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software. CUDA allows the apps to use the GPUs for parallel processing compute, among other tasks. Just like the Intel versus SPARC chip war of yesterday, it’s no small thing to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/behind-plot-break-nvidias-grip-ai-by-targeting-software-2024-03-25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rewrite an AI app for a non-CUDA chip.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Amazon may have a plan for that. As we previously reported, the next generation of its AI chip, Trainium4, will be built to interoperate with Nvidia’s GPUs in the same system. Whether that helps peel more business away from Nvidia or simply reinforces its dominance, but on AWS’s cloud, remains to be seen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It may not matter to Amazon. If it is already on track to make multibillion dollars from the Trainium2 chip, and the next generation will be that much better, it may be winner enough.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. </em><strong><em>This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.</em></strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
