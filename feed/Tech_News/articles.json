The winner was a Brazilian prompt engineer named Eduardo Rocha de Andrade, who will receive $50,000 for the prize. But more surprising than the win was his final score: He won with correct answers to just 7.5% of the questions on the test.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re glad we built a benchmark that is actually hard,” said Konwinski. “Benchmarks should be hard if they’re going to matter,” he continued, adding: “Scores would be different if the big labs had entered with their biggest models. But that’s kind of the point. K Prize runs offline with limited compute, so it favors smaller and open models. I love that. It levels the playing field.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Konwinski has pledged $1 million to the first open source model that can score higher than 90% on the test.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to the well-known SWE-Bench system, the K Prize tests models against flagged issues from GitHub as a test of how well models can deal with real-world programming problems. But while SWE-Bench is based on a fixed set of problems that models can train against, the K Prize is designed as a “contamination-free version of SWE-Bench,” using a timed entry system to guard against any benchmark-specific training. For round one, models were due by March 12. The K Prize organizers then built the test using only GitHub issues flagged after that date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 7.5% top score stands in marked contrast to SWE-Bench itself, which currently shows a 75% top score on its easier “Verified” test and 34% on its harder “Full” test. Konwinski still isn’t sure whether the disparity is due to contamination on SWE-Bench or just the challenge of collecting new issues from GitHub, but he expects the K Prize project to answer the question soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we get more runs of the thing, we’ll have a better sense,” he told TechCrunch, “because we expect people to adapt to the dynamics of competing on this every few months.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It might seem like an odd place to fall short, given the wide range of AI coding tools already publicly available — but with benchmarks becoming too easy, many critics see projects like the K Prize as a necessary step toward solving <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/08/1116192/how-to-build-a-better-ai-benchmark/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI’s growing evaluation problem</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m quite bullish about building new tests for existing benchmarks,” says Princeton researcher Sayash Kapoor, who put forward a similar idea <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01502\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a recent paper</a>. “Without such experiments, we can’t actually tell if the issue is contamination, or even just targeting the SWE-Bench leaderboard with a human in the loop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Konwinski, it’s not just a better benchmark, but an open challenge to the rest of the industry. “If you listen to the hype, it’s like we should be seeing AI doctors and AI lawyers and AI software engineers, and that’s just not true,” he says. “If we can’t even get more than 10% on a contamination-free SWE-Bench, that’s the reality check for me.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

U.S. officials later <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-scrutinizes-chinese-ai-ideological-bias-memo-shows-2025-07-09/\">confirmed</a> that these tools are engineered to reflect Beijing’s talking points, raising concerns about censorship and bias.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">American AI leaders like OpenAI have pointed to this as justification for advancing their tech quickly, without too much regulation or oversight. As OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7342879984203591680/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn post</a> last month, there is a contest between “US-led democratic AI and Communist-led China’s autocratic AI.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/preventing-woke-ai-in-the-federal-government/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">An executive order</a> signed Wednesday by President Donald Trump that bans “woke AI” and AI models that aren’t “ideologically neutral” from government contracts could disrupt that balance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order calls out diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), calling it a “pervasive and destructive” ideology that can “distort the quality and accuracy of the output.” Specifically, the order refers to information about race or sex, manipulation of racial or sexual representation, critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Experts warn it could create a chilling effect on developers who may feel pressure to align model outputs and datasets with White House rhetoric to secure federal dollars for their cash-burning businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order comes the same day the White House published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">Trump’s “AI Action Plan</a>,” which shifts national priorities away from societal risk and focuses instead on building out AI infrastructure, cutting red tape for tech companies, shoring up national security, and competing with China. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order instructs the director of the Office of Management and Budget along with the administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the administrator of General Services, and the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to issue guidance to other agencies on how to comply. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Once and for all, we are getting rid of woke,” Trump said Wednesday during an AI event hosted by the All-In Podcast and Hill &amp; Valley Forum. “I will be signing an order banning the federal government from procuring AI technology that has been infused with partisan bias or ideological agendas, such as critical race theory, which is ridiculous. And from now on the U.S. government will deal only with AI that pursues truth, fairness, and strict impartiality.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Determining what is impartial or objective is one of many challenges to the order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Philip Seargeant, senior lecturer in applied linguistics at the Open University, told TechCrunch that nothing can ever be objective. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the fundamental tenets of sociolinguistics is that language is never neutral,” Seargeant said. “So the idea that you can ever get pure objectivity is a fantasy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, the Trump administration’s ideology doesn’t reflect the beliefs and values of all Americans. Trump has repeatedly sought to eliminate funding for climate initiatives, education, public broadcasting, research, social service grants, community and agricultural support programs, and gender-affirming care, often framing these initiatives as examples of “woke” or politically biased government spending. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, put it, “Anything [the Trump administration doesn’t] like is immediately tossed into this pejorative pile of woke.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The definitions of “truth-seeking” and “ideological neutrality” in the order published Wednesday are vague in some ways and specific in others. While “truth-seeking” is defined as LLMs that “prioritize historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity,” “ideological neutrality” is defined as LLMs that are “neutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those definitions leave room for broad interpretation, as well as potential pressure. AI companies have pushed for fewer constraints on how they operate. And while an executive order doesn’t carry the force of legislation, frontier AI firms could still find themselves subject to the shifting priorities of the administration’s political agenda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI <a href=\"https://www.ai.mil/Latest/News-Press/PR-View/Article/4242822/cdao-announces-partnerships-with-frontier-ai-companies-to-address-national-secu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed contracts</a> with the Department of Defense to receive up to $200 million each to develop agentic AI workflows that address critical national security challenges. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear which of these companies is best positioned to gain from the woke AI ban, or if they will comply. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to each of them and will update this article if we hear back. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite displaying biases of its own, xAI may be the most aligned with the order — at least at this early stage. Elon Musk has positioned Grok, xAI’s chatbot, as the ultimate anti-woke, “less biased,” truthseeker. Grok’s system prompts have directed it to avoid deferring to mainstream authorities and media, to seek contrarian information even if it’s politically incorrect, and to even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-4-seems-to-consult-elon-musk-to-answer-controversial-questions/\">reference Musk’s own views</a> on controversial topics. In recent months, Grok has even spouted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/06/improved-grok-criticizes-democrats-and-hollywoods-jewish-executives/\">antisemitic comments</a> and praised Hitler on X, among other hateful, racist, and misogynistic posts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University, told TechCrunch the executive order is “clearly intended as viewpoint discrimination, since [the government] just signed a contract with Grok, aka ‘MechaHitler.’” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside xAI’s DOD funding, the company announced that “<a href=\"https://x.ai/news/government\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Grok for Government</a>” had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products are now available for purchase across every government office and agency. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The right question is this: would they ban Grok, the AI they just signed a large contract with, because it has been deliberately engineered to give politically charged answers?” Lemley said in an email interview. “If not, it is clearly designed to discriminate against a particular viewpoint.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Grok’s own system prompts have shown, model outputs can be a reflection of both the people building the technology and the data the AI is trained on. In some cases, an overabundance of caution among developers and AI trained on internet content that promotes values like inclusivity have led to distorted model outputs. Google, for example, last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/23/embarrassing-and-wrong-google-admits-it-lost-control-of-image-generating-ai/\">came under fire</a> after its Gemini chatbot showed a black George Washington and racially diverse Nazis — which Trump’s order calls out as an example of DEI-infected AI models.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chowdhury says her biggest fear with this executive order is that AI companies will actively rework training data to tow the party line. She pointed to <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1936333964693885089\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statements</a> from Musk a few weeks prior to launching Grok 4, saying that xAI would use the new model and its advanced reasoning capabilities to “rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors. Then retrain on that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This would ostensibly put Musk into the position of judging what is true, which could have huge downstream implications for how information is accessed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, companies have been making judgment calls about what information is seen and not seen since the dawn of the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conservative David Sacks — the entrepreneur and investor who Trump appointed as AI czar — has been outspoken about his concerns around “woke AI” on the All-In Podcast, which <a href=\"https://x.com/jacobhelberg/status/1945177489539580003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">co-hosted</a> Trump’s day of AI announcements. Sacks has accused the creators of prominent AI products of infusing them with left-wing values, framing his arguments as a defense of free speech, and a warning against a trend toward centralized ideological control in digital platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem, experts say, is that there is no one truth. Achieving unbiased or neutral results is impossible, especially in today’s world where even facts are politicized. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the results that an AI produces say that climate science is correct, is that left wing bias?” Seargeant said. “Some people say you need to give both sides of the argument to be objective, even if one side of the argument has no status to it.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google CEO Sundar Pichai says he is “very excited” to supply OpenAI, the search giant’s largest competitor in AI, with cloud computing resources to train and serve the company’s AI models as part of a recently struck partnership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With respect to OpenAI, look, we are very excited to be partnering with them on Google Cloud,” said Pichai on Google’s second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. “Google Cloud is an open platform, and we have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups, AI labs, etc. So super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side, and we look forward to investing more in that relationship and growing that.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The comment came shortly after analysts peppered Pichai and other Google executives with questions about how AI would affect its core search business and why Google is spending an extra $10 billion on capital expenditures this year to catch up in the AI race. Roughly two and a half years since the launch of ChatGPT, Google has now shifted its focus squarely on developing leading AI models and products to compete with OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is a major threat to Google Search, but the OpenAI deal marks a massive new customer for Google Cloud. It’s a treacherous relationship for Google to navigate; OpenAI may ultimately use Google’s cloud infrastructure and chips to upend the company’s core Search product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">quietly added Google Cloud to a public list of suppliers</a> that it uses for cloud computing services, alongside Microsoft and Oracle. Reuters previously reported in June that OpenAI was considering tapping Google Cloud for <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">extra computational power</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Google Cloud revenue soared in the second quarter of 2025 to $13.6 billion, up from $10.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Google attributes a significant chunk of that growth to the Google Cloud Platform and other products it offers to AI companies. Google Cloud is still a small business relative to Google Search, but it seems to be growing in the AI era.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several large AI labs have tapped Google Cloud as a cloud computing partner, including Anthropic, Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence, Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, and now OpenAI. Pichai noted on the earnings call that the company has been successful at winning deals with large AI labs thanks to its large supply of Nvidia GPU chips and in-house TPU chips.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google Cloud seems like a smart partner for OpenAI. The startup is extremely constrained when it comes to Nvidia GPUs, which it uses to train new AI models and serve them to hundreds of millions of users. Those constraints have been a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiW6CAHf4C2kJ5ZYMKIFG6wDWajUDBxDpYq9PosVsrRdWwe8aMqzwyyxnoolw%3D%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68816068&amp;gaa_sig=8ngTmAJf4cJ4_oNOBbNI_pYVIOwWKZR1mqwbL0IQ5M-Quv5pdCQzwPUvI3Ktxtpdt4A2o1rMUSn9zdrxjz5NhA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">major tension point with OpenAI’s biggest backer and largest cloud computing partner, Microsoft</a>, forcing the ChatGPT maker to turn to its competitors in the cloud market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the AI products front, Google seems to be doing better than initially expected. The company said its AI chatbot, Gemini, now reaches 450 million monthly active users, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\">AI Overviews reaches 2 billion monthly active users</a>. However, the business around these products remains unclear, as does the share of queries they’re taking from Google Search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to imagine that Pichai is truly that excited about working with OpenAI, a company that represents the biggest threat Google Search has ever faced. The partnership is reminiscent of Google’s deal with Yahoo from decades ago, when it was just a startup, and used Yahoo’s homepage as an accelerant to overtake it as the front door to the internet. How lasting OpenAI’s relationship with Google is remains to be seen.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841610/000114036124040642/ny20034661x2_def14a.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">September 2024 filing</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SPAC had returned much of its money to shareholders when it failed to find an acquisition target by September 2024 and held $30.5 million in trust. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, just 16 days later, the company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001841610/000114036124042068/ef20036368_8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported in an 8-K</a> that another $28.8 million had been redeemed — leaving the trust as of that date with just 0.5% of its original amount, or $1.6 million. The remaining shareholders (primarily the SPAC’s sponsors) agreed at that time to extend the date to find an acquisition target to March 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, iRocket, was at one time buzzy because it was backed by venture capital firm Village Global, which counts billionaires like Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt, and Reid Hoffman among its limited partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even still, iRocket is a surprising target for a take-public deal. The company has raised only a few million in venture funding, according to PitchBook, in an industry that is known for being extremely capital intensive. Since its founding in 2018, it has yet to conduct a single test flight of its Shockwave launch vehicle. In that time, it has been overtaken by other firms, like Stoke Space and Firefly, that are better capitalized and farther along in their hardware development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market has changed, too: As of 2023, iRocket described Shockwave as being able to carry 300 kg to 1,500 kg payloads, and that space has become crowded with vehicles like Firefly’s Alpha and Rocket Lab’s Electron, both of which have flown customer payloads. If iRocket can prove out the rest of its value proposition — full reusability, rapid refurbishment, and 24-hour responsiveness — it could prove very competitive, but that’s a tough series of goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York-based startup lists just four employees, excluding board members, on LinkedIn. Its contracts include an $18 million deal with the Air Force Research Lab and a $1.8 million contract with the Space Force. A PR firm representing iRocket and the SPAC declined to respond to TechCrunch’s questions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The special purpose acquisition vehicle has a checkered past. Operating under the name Ross Acquisition Corp II, it tried to take public biopharma company Aprinoia Therapeutics in January 2023 but terminated the deal eight months later. After failing to consummate a transaction, the NYSE subsequently commenced delisting proceedings against the SPAC last March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RAC II changed its name to BPGC Acquisition Corp. and now has until March 2026 to close a deal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But given the SPAC’s current cash reserves, if iRocket’s existing shareholders expect to be paid much cash for their equity, the two parties will need to pull in a big chunk of money from private equity investors in a PIPE (private investment in public equity) round.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This growth brings YouTube’s total ad revenue to $9.8 billion, up from $8.7 billion in the same period last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company slightly exceeded analyst expectations, which had forecast YouTube’s Q2 ad revenue to be around $9.6 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, YouTube has been striving to capture a larger share of television ad dollars, especially as its popularity in TV has grown, accounting for a significant portion of its viewership. A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">recent report from Nielsen</a> indicated that YouTube held the largest share of TV viewing for three consecutive months, representing 12.4% of the total audience time spent watching television.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to YouTube’s success, rival streaming services, such as <a href=\"https://thestreamable.com/max-increases-ads-per-hour-to-6-minutes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">HBO Max</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-doubles-prime-video-ad-load/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon Prime Video</a>, have ramped up their advertising strategies, increasing ad placements to stimulate growth. Additionally, Netflix is emerging as a key competitor to YouTube, particularly after it announced its intentions to double its advertising revenue within the year during the company’s earnings call last week. Although Netflix has not publicly disclosed its ad revenue figures, an analyst from Madison &amp; Wall <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/netflix--fox-highlight-ad-revenue-surges-upfronts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">estimates</a> that it’s around $3 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Alphabet reported strong results, with total revenue of $96.4 billion in the second quarter, representing a 13% year-over-year increase.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On the company’s Q2 2025 call with investors, Pichai shared that AI Overviews — a Google Search feature offering an AI summary of search results available in 200 countries and territories — now has 2 billion monthly users, up from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-ai-mode-rolls-out-to-us-will-add-support-for-deeper-research-comparison-shopping-and-more/\">1.5 billion in May 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Google’s Gemini app has grown to 450 million monthly active users. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We continue to see strong growth and engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1,” Pichai said of the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AI Mode — a way to use Google Search via an AI chat experience to get more in-depth answers — has over 100 million monthly active users, Pichai said. The service is available in the U.S. and, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/google-introduces-ai-mode-to-users-in-india/\">more recently, India</a>, but is still rolling out. The CEO also said the experience will be upgraded in the near future with the addition of the advanced research tool, Deep Search, and more personalized responses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the developer front, Google said more than 9 million have built with Gemini and over 70 million videos have been produced with the Veo 3 AI model since May. Google Vids, a Veo-powered feature for text-to-video AI generation in Google Workspace, now has nearly 1 million monthly active users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Google Meet, over 50 million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet, the company also said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stats are meant to illustrate consumer demand for AI features. For instance, Google shared that AI Overviews were driving over 10% more Google Search queries, for the types of searches that show them. However, it’s arguably difficult to determine how many people have truly and willingly turned to AI in Search, when the features have been thrust upon them as aggressively as they have been.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across Google’s platform and products, Google quantified its growth by monthly tokens processed, saying that it had announced at its developer conference in May that it had processed 480 trillion monthly tokens, and that figure has now doubled to 980 trillion monthly tokens. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio,” Pichai told investors. “Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated, full-stack approach to AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors, however, reacted negatively to Google’s plans to increase its capital expenditure spending to keep up with the AI race, which sent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/alphabet-slips-after-boosting-guidance-for-capital-expenditures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the stock slipping</a> shortly after earnings were announced.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn’t enough to close the gap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company reported Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/TSLA-Q2-2025-Update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revenue of $22.5 billion</a>, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company’s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year.  Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meanwhile, Tesla’s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Tesla noted pressure from an “uncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs” and “unclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,” the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Q2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla’s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,” the company said in its shareholder letter.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla’s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Tesla’s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales — although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company’s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla’s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Earlier this month, Tesla said it <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-second-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delivered</a> 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year, a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivered 337,000 vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But it also doesn’t want the U.S.’s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s quite the balance to strike.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If President Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Action Plan</a>, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“​​America currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,” the plan stated. “It is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through “creative approaches” followed by a pair of policy recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn’t a focus on many of the component subsystems — a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“America must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,” the plan states. “We should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there’s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months — including just last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/nvidias-resumption-of-h20-chip-sales-related-to-rare-earth-element-trade-talks/\">the green light to start selling AI chips</a> they had developed for China, just months after rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/\">licensing restrictions on the same AI chips</a> that effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/\">AI diffusion rule</a> (which put a cap on how much AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it’s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The organization on Wednesday announced it’s launching a campaign that introduces banners inside its Android and iOS apps, prompting users to make a monetary donation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, the feature will be shown only to those on the Mastodon servers the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/mastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure/\">nonprofit</a> itself operates, Mastodon.social and Mastodon.online. These banners will be easy to dismiss, Mastodon says, and will only be shown to people who have accounts that have existed for at least four weeks. The organization promises that it won’t continually prompt users to donate, either.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such campaigns can work well for nonprofit organizations at scale. Wikimedia Foundation, for example, brings in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising/2024_banners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">majority</a> of its funding from individual donors, including those who donate through the pop-up banners that occasionally appear on Wikipedia. However, Mastodon has a much smaller user base: 8.1 million <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fedidb.com/\">r</a><a href=\"https://fedidb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">e</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fedidb.com/\">gistered</a> accounts, and fewer than 1 million monthly active users. Still, the banners could encourage people who haven’t actively sought out ways to contribute to now do so, as it makes the process more seamless as an in-app feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon says it will later expand the campaign to the web and, if successful, make it available to all other Mastodon instances. The latter would allow individual server admins to receive direct support from their own users, which could help keep them operational. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an open, decentralized social media platform, Mastodon faces challenges when it comes to financial support. Unlike Meta and X, which are supported by ads, Mastodon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/amid-twitter-chaos-mastodon-grew-donations-488-in-2022-reached-1-8m-monthly-active-users/\">so far has relied largely on</a> user donations from Patreon. It has also accepted a handful of donations from open source-focused funds and foundations over the years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/reports/Mastodon%20Annual%20Report%202023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2023</a>, Mastodon raised €545,000 in total donations, up 65% year-over-year, but its Patreon donor base dropped nearly 23% to 7,400.

For instance, the AI Action Plan downplays efforts to mitigate possible harms of AI and instead prioritizes <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/openai-agreed-to-pay-oracle-30b-a-year-for-data-center-services/\">building out data centers</a> to power the AI industry, even if it means using federal lands or keeping them powered during critical energy grid periods. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of its effects, however, will depend on how the AI Action Plan is executed, and many of those details have yet to be sorted. The AI Action Plan is more blueprint for action than a step-by-step instruction book. But the direction is clear: Progress is king.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration positions this as the only way to “usher in a new golden age of human flourishing.” Its goal is to convince the American public that spending billions of taxpayer dollars on building data centers is in their best interest. Parts of the plan also include policy suggestions around upskilling workers and partnering with local governments to create jobs related to working in data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation,” Trump said in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a>. “To do that, we will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape, as the Administration has done since Inauguration Day. Simply put, we need to ‘Build, Baby, Build!’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Action Plan is authored by the Trump administration’s team of technology and AI specialists, many of whom come from Silicon Valley companies. This includes Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios; AI and crypto czar David Sacks; and assistant to the president for national security affairs Marco Rubio. More than 10,000 interest groups submitted public comments that were considered for the plan.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-deregulation-and-bringing-back-the-ai-moratorium\">Deregulation and bringing back the AI moratorium</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the start of this month, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/us-senate-removes-controversial-ai-moratorium-from-budget-bill/\">Senate removed a controversial provision</a> in the budget bill that would bar states from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/\">regulating AI for 10 years</a>. That provision, if it had been included in the bill, would tie states’ federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It appears that matter hasn’t been put to rest yet, as the AI Action Plan explores a new way to hinder states from regulating AI. As part of a broader mission to “unleash prosperity through deregulation,” the administration threatens to limit states’ federal funding based on their AI regulations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan also directs the Federal Communications Commission to “evaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with the agency’s ability to carry out its obligations and authorities.” In other words, if state AI regulations touch on radio, TV, and internet — which many do — then the FCC can get involved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the federal level, the action plan directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that hinder AI innovation and adoption so that federal agencies can take appropriate action.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cutting-red-tape-around-data-centers\">Cutting red tape around data centers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s call for deregulation extends to how the administration hopes to accelerate the buildout of AI-related infrastructure, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">data centers</a>, semiconductor fabs, and power sources. The administration argues that existing environmental regulations — like NEPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act — are hindering America’s need to meet the rapid demands of the AI arms race. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Trump’s AI Action Plan places an emphasis on stabilizing America’s energy grid. At the same time, the plan asks the federal government to find new ways to ensure large power consumers — such as AI companies — can manage their power consumption during critical grid periods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Certain companies, like xAI and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Meta</a>, have been criticized for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/memphis-xai-elon-musk-pollution-naacp-571c16950259b382f9eae61bd59260ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Critics have accused xAI</a> of bypassing environmental safeguards and exposing residents to harmful emissions from gas-powered turbines with its Memphis data center. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The action plan calls for creating categorical exclusions, streamlining permitting processes, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41 to make it easier for companies to build critical AI infrastructure, especially on federal lands, which includes national parks, federally protected wilderness areas, and military bases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tying back to other Trump themes of beating China, the strategy focuses on locking out foreign tech and emphasizing security protections to keep “adversarial technology” — like Chinese-made chips and hardware — out of the U.S. supply chain. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-trump-s-war-on-biased-ai\">Trump’s war on “biased AI”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the main standouts in Trump’s AI Action plan is a focus on protecting free speech and “American values,” in part by eliminating references to misinformation, DEI, and climate change from federal risk-assessment frameworks.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is essential that these systems be built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind, and that U.S. government policy does not interfere with that objective,” the plan reads. “We must ensure that free speech flourishes in the era of AI and that AI procured by the Federal government objectively reflects truth rather than social engineering agendas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the intention to ensure that government policy doesn’t interfere with freedom of speech, the AI Action Plan has the potential to do just that. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the recommended policy actions is to update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who “ensure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That language is similar to what <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> would be in Trump’s executive order, which is expected to be released later today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem is that achieving objectivity is hard, and the government has not yet defined how it plans to evaluate models on the basis of neutrality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only way to be neutral would be literal non-engagement,” Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic, xAI, Google, and OpenAI have all secured government contracts <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/anthropic-google-openai-xai-granted-up-to-200-million-from-dod.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">worth up to $200 million</a> each to help integrate AI applications into the Department of Defense. The implications of Trump’s policy suggestion and his impending executive order, could be far-reaching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For instance, an order that says, ‘We won’t do any business, as to AI models or otherwise, with any company that produces a non-neutral AI model’ would likely violate the First Amendment,” Eugene Volokh, an American legal scholar who specializes in First Amendment and Second Amendment issues, said in an email. “An order that says, ‘We will only enter into contracts to buy models that are sufficiently neutral’ would be more constitutionally defensible, though of course implementing it effectively may be very difficult (partly because it’s so hard to know what’s ‘neutral’ in these situations).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added: “If the order instructs agencies to select AIs based on a combination of accuracy and neutrality, leaving each agency with some latitude to decide what that means, that might be more viable.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-encouraging-an-open-approach-to-ai\">Encouraging an open approach to AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI Action Plan aims to encourage the development and adoption of open AI models, which are free to download online and are created with American values in mind. This largely seems to be a reaction to the rise of open AI models from Chinese AI labs, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot-app/\">DeepSeek</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/alibaba-unveils-qwen-3-a-family-of-hybrid-ai-reasoning-models/\">Alibaba’s Qwen</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of his plan, Trump wants to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large computing clusters. These resources are expensive and typically were only possible for tech companies that could strike million- or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump also says he wants to partner with leading AI model developers to increase the research community’s access to private AI models and data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">American AI companies and organizations that have taken an open approach — including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face — could benefit from Trump’s embrace of open AI.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-safety-and-security\">AI safety and security</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s AI Action Plan includes some provisions to satisfy the AI safety community. One of those efforts includes launching a federal technological development program to research AI interpretability, AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s plan also instructs federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to host hackathons to test its AI systems for security vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s plan also acknowledges the risks of AI systems to contribute to cyberattacks, as well as the development of chemical and biological weapons. The plan asks frontier AI model developers to work with federal agencies to evaluate these risks and asks how they could jeopardize America’s national security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compared to Biden’s AI executive order, Trump’s plan puts less of a focus on requiring leading AI model developers to report safety and security standards. Many tech companies claim safety and security reporting is an “onerous” task, which Trump seems to want to limit.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-limiting-china\">Limiting China</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump is bringing his war on China into the AI race with his action plan. A large part of Trump’s AI Action Plan focuses on preventing “national security” threats from accessing advanced AI technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under Trump’s plan, federal agencies will work together to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one of those efforts, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These groups will also conduct assessments on the level of AI adoption among America’s adversaries.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-national-security\">National security</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/trump-fires-head-of-national-security-agency-and-cyber-command/\">National security</a>” was mentioned 23 times in the AI Action Plan — more than “data centers,” “jobs,” “science,” and other key terms. The plan’s national security strategy is centered on integrating AI into the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, and even building out AI data centers for the DoD, while guarding against foreign threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among other things, the plan calls for the DoD and intelligence community to regularly assess how AI adoption in the U.S. compares to rivals like China and adapt accordingly, and to evaluate risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the DoD itself, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As the density and speed of the ions rises, they begin to collide and fuse, releasing energy in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Getting to really high voltages is the key thing,” Langtry, Avalanche’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. And given that the company is building small reactors — targeting anywhere from 5 kilowatts to several hundred kilowatts — the density of that voltage, 6 million volts per meter, is important. “That’s the real unlock for us,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that sort of force, Avalanche expects it will be able to generate a large number of neutrons at low cost, which can be used to make radioisotopes and to evaluate materials for use in fusion reactors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company was recently awarded $10 million from Washington State to build FusionWERX, a testing facility where other fusion companies and researchers can book time to study their own fusion technologies. Money for the grant comes from proceeds from the state’s carbon marketplace. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can test your hardware, and then you get to leave with full ownership of your IP at the end of the day,” Langtry said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sales of radioisotopes and rentals of the FusionWERX facility should make Avalanche profitable in 2028, he said. Langtry is forecasting that the company will generate $30 million to $50 million in revenue in 2029.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a path to revenue, and having hit the 300,000-volt milestone, Avalanche is rumored to be raising a Series A round. Langtry wouldn’t comment specifically on the company’s fundraising activities, though he did say that it’s lining up the money needed to fulfill the 50% cost-match requirement of the Washington State grant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve already got a pretty good chunk of it lined up,” he said. Raising money to launch FusionWERX is “goal number one right now,” he added. “Then all the other stuff is going to fall in place as those pieces start getting built.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They’re also some of the most pesticide-reliant fruits and consistently top the Environmental Working Group’s <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/strawberries.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“Dirty Dozen” list</a> of the most contaminated produce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">San Luis Obispo, California-based <a href=\"https://www.tricrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TRIC Robotics</a> thinks it can help strawberry farmers reduce chemical use with the help of UV light and robots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built a fleet of robots that use UV-C light, a form of ultraviolet light that is largely blocked by the earth’s atmosphere, to kill bacteria and damage pest populations. The tractor-sized autonomous robots can treat up to 100 acres and also use vacuums designed to suck up bug residue without hurting crops.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company runs its robots at farms overnight as a service, as opposed to selling them directly to farmers, because, while harder to scale, this model seemed like the right one to start getting traction quickly, Adam Stager, the co-founder and CEO of TRIC, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We worked a lot with the farmers to understand the right way to launch the technology and what was the right business model,” Stager said. “We found out that a lot of the farmers pay for pest disease control as a service, so they have a company come in and do the sprays. And what we’ve been doing is just replacing that as a service model.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Stager said the company has been very focused on what farmers want, it wasn’t always that way. In fact, TRIC wasn’t even focused on agriculture to begin with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stager launched the company in 2017 after completing his PhD in robotics. The company was initially focused on 3D-printed robots for SWAT teams. In 2020, Stager decided to pivot into an area he thought would have more impact and started focusing on agriculture.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really just wanted to answer the question, if you were to die tomorrow, would you be happy with what you accomplished in your life?” Stager said. “I was like, okay, I really need to do something impactful that can help a lot of people to feel value for myself. I kind of stumbled into agriculture on that journey, [and realized] that’s a place where we can impact so many people, just about everybody.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stager reached out to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to see if there was any technology they were working on that he could help commercialize, knowing from his PhD program that a lot of great technology never leaves the lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He got connected to a USDA program that brings folks like Stager and scientists, who haven’t yet commercialized their work, together. This outreach connected him to the UV light technology that became the basis for TRIC’s robotics.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We loaded two robots that we built in my garage on top of the SUV,” Stager said about him and co-founder Vishnu Somasundaram. “We had two connections that the USDA helped us build with farmers that were willing to give us just a tiny little piece of land in 2021 and that’s really the beginning of when this company started. It was a cross-country journey of Airbnb surfing for eight months where we were deploying two robots and getting this amazing data with these farmers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the company, which also counts Ryan Berard as its third co-founder, works with four large strawberry producers, has deployed nine robots, and has three more robots on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TRIC Robotics recently raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Version One Ventures with participation from Garage Capital, Todd and Rahul Capital, and Lucas Venture Group, among other investment firms and individual angels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to put the money toward continuing to build out its fleet of autonomous robots, and TRIC eventually wants to move into other types of crops as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there is going to be a really, really bright future for [agriculture] tech,” Stager said. “I just think people should know that things are really headed in a great direction, and there’s really a lot of exciting things to come.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
