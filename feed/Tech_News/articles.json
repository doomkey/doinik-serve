These tools are coming to the Spotify for Creators app, and Megaphone, the company’s podcast hosting and monetization suite, in April.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Doubling down on its video strategy in a bid to compete better with YouTube, Spotify is now launching a new API that would let creators use their existing platforms to publish and monetize video podcasts on Spotify. At launch, tools like Acast, Audioboom, Libsyn, Omny, and Podigee have adopted this API, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new moves come as Spotify’s been looking to new avenues to attract users and build on its streaming subscription revenue. The company said since the launch of the partner program, the consumption of video podcasts on the app has nearly doubled, and that the average Spotify podcast user streams twice as many video shows per month as they did before the program was launched. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that could simply be a result of the streaming service surfacing more video content. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also opening a studio for recording podcasts and videos in West Hollywood. Spotify said the studio would serve as a base for the Ringer podcast network, and it would open up the studio to select creators from the partner program. The company already has studios across the art district in LA, New York, Stockholm, and London.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is now rolling out the requirement globally after first testing it in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/roblox-will-require-all-users-to-perform-age-checks-to-access-chat-starting-in-january/\">few markets</a> last month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age check is processed, Roblox says it will delete any images or videos of users. The verification is being processed by a third-party vendor, Persona, which also deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says users who are 13 and older can also choose to verify their age through ID verification instead of facial verification. Roblox notes that while age checks are optional, they’re required if users want to access communication features. In other words, you don’t have to verify your age to use Roblox, but you do need verification to use chat features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080463\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Leveraging multiple signals, Roblox is constantly evaluating user behavior to determine if someone is significantly older or younger than expected,” the company wrote in a blog post. “In these situations, Roblox will soon ask users to repeat the age-check process.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chat, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with users in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox says chat is disabled by default for children under 9 unless a parent provides consent following an age check. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The introduction of mandatory age checks comes amid multiple lawsuits, including from the attorneys general of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/07/texas-ag-sues-roblox-accusing-it-of-prioritizing-pixel-pedophiles-over-child-safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Texas</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Louisiana</a>, against Roblox over child safety concerns.

Subramaniyan (pictured above, center) said in an interview. He declined to disclose the size of the initial installment, but said the company expects to close the round in the first quarter of this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Articul8’s valuation for its current funding round marks a roughly fivefold increase from the company’s $100 million post-money Series A valuation in January 2024. Since then, the Santa Clara-based company said it has surpassed $90 million in total contract value — the cumulative value of all signed customer contracts — from 29 paying customers, including Hitachi Energy, AWS, Franklin Templeton, and Intel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subramaniyan told TechCrunch that Articul8 was not under pressure to raise capital, describing the company as revenue-positive following a series of large enterprise contracts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are not cash-strapped,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company expects to finish the year with annual recurring revenue of just over $57 million, Subramaniyan said, with roughly 45% to 50% of that already recognized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Articul8 develops specialized AI systems that operate within customers’ own IT environments, rather than relying on shared, general-purpose models. Instead of selling standalone models, the company packages its technology as software applications and AI agents tailored to specific business functions, targeting regulated industries such as energy, manufacturing, aerospace, financial services, and semiconductors, where accuracy, auditability, and data control are critical.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg\" alt=\"Articul8 knowledge graph\" class=\"wp-image-3080549\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=1200,766 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=1280,817 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=430,275 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=720,460 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=900,575 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=800,511 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=1536,981 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=668,427 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=587,375 587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=966,617 966w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=708,452 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Articul8’s knowledge graph view</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Articul8</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our competition is pretty much everybody,” said Subramaniyan. “But today, the major competitors are the cloud service providers, because they have realized that their model, as the general-purpose [offerings], are all commodities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Articul8’s focus on specialized systems appeals to customers who need predictable results and clear audit trails, something that is harder to achieve with general-purpose models run on shared cloud platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Articul8 plans to use the Series B proceeds primarily to expand research and product development and to scale its operations internationally, with a focus on Europe and parts of Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adara Ventures’ participation will help speed-up the European expansion plan, as the European Investment Fund backs the Madrid-based VC firm’s energy fund, Subramaniyan said. The company is also looking to scale in markets including Japan and South Korea, where it has begun working with large enterprise customers, he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s Aditya Birla Ventures also participated in the ongoing round, Subramaniyan stated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Articul8 works with large tech groups including Nvidia and Google Cloud, Subramaniyan said, adding that Amazon Web Services is both a customer and a partner for the company on some deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company employs 75 people, with about 80% focused on R&amp;D, and teams spread across the U.S., Brazil, and India.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sternfels said that while AI models can handle many tasks, sound judgment and creativity remain the essential skills humans must bring to succeed in an AI-infused world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Taneja argued that people must recognize that “skilling and re-skilling” will be a lifelong endeavor. “This idea that we spend 22 years learning and then 40 years working is broken,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calacanis agreed that in a world where it may take less time to build an AI agent than to train a new worker, people must find ways to stay relevant. “To stand out, you’re going to have to show chutzpah, drive, passion,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sternfels provided a glimpse into that future. While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They appear assured that the deal is legitimate despite earlier misgivings about Benchmark’s investment in Manus. China’s regulators, however, are reportedly <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62f8f2c5-95c7-4437-b0f1-b8ecd507c330\">not quite as sanguine</a>, according to the Financial Times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Benchmark led a financing round for Manus earlier this year, the investment sparked immediate controversy. U.S. Senator John Cornyn complained about the deal on X, and the investment prompted inquiries from the U.S. Treasury Department around new rules restricting American investment in Chinese AI companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concerns were significant enough to spur Manus’s eventual relocation from Beijing to Singapore — part of what drove the company’s “step-by-step disentanglement from China,” as one Chinese professor described it on WeChat this past weekend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the tables have turned. Chinese officials are reportedly reviewing whether the Meta deal violates technology export controls, potentially giving Beijing leverage it wasn’t initially perceived as having. Specifically, they’re examining whether Manus needed an export license when it relocated its core team from China to Singapore — a move that’s apparently now so common it has earned the nickname “Singapore washing.” A recent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-metas-newest-acquisition-target-got-around-worries-over-its-ties-to-china-de2d24b6?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcrTVX1MUYvUWg8ksZ6tM64edcFnQ6aptjg9-avIhw-plXkBacZivyunqIHfgQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=695dc8d6&amp;gaa_sig=33qIhEwK25wz9_w0B5cn-vB20eqMQhs4zlBYykjunKrv_MPtk_knnOvje6VLh8yrQYaRDKwEbNwE5FywcuDteg%3D%3D\">Wall Street Journal article</a> speculated that China has “few tools to influence the deal given Manus’s foothold in Singapore,” but that assessment may have been premature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concern in Beijing is that this deal could encourage more Chinese startups to physically relocate to dodge domestic oversight. Winston Ma, a professor at New York University School of Law and partner at Dragon Capital, told the Journal that if the deal closes smoothly, “It creates a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-metas-newest-acquisition-target-got-around-worries-over-its-ties-to-china-de2d24b6?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcrTVX1MUYvUWg8ksZ6tM64edcFnQ6aptjg9-avIhw-plXkBacZivyunqIHfgQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=695dc8d6&amp;gaa_sig=33qIhEwK25wz9_w0B5cn-vB20eqMQhs4zlBYykjunKrv_MPtk_knnOvje6VLh8yrQYaRDKwEbNwE5FywcuDteg%3D%3D\">new path</a> for the young AI startups in China.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">History suggests Beijing could act. China previously used similar export control mechanisms to intervene in Trump’s attempted TikTok ban during his first term. The Chinese professor on WeChat even warned that Manus’ founders could face criminal liability if they exported restricted technology without authorization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, some U.S. analysts are calling the acquisition a win for Washington’s investment restrictions, arguing it shows Chinese AI talent is defecting to the American ecosystem. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cfr.org/expert/chris-mcguire\">One expert</a> told the FT that the deal demonstrates “the US AI ecosystem is currently more attractive.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s too early to know if this impacts Meta’s plans to integrate Manus’s AI agent software into its products, but this $2 billion deal may have gotten more complicated than anyone anticipated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But in this case, the poster had made up his story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People lie on the internet all the time. But it’s not so common for such posts to hit the front page of Reddit, garner over 87,000 upvotes, and get crossposted to other platforms like X, where it got <a href=\"https://x.com/d0wnsideofme/status/2006970570769101234?ref=platformer.news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">another 208,000 likes</a> and 36.8 million impressions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Casey Newton, the journalist behind <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Platformer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/fake-uber-eats-whisleblower-hoax-debunked/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> that he contacted the Reddit poster, who then contacted him on Signal.

But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter?

In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SynthID</a> watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Max Spero — founder of <a href=\"https://www.pangram.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pangram Labs</a>, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Spero told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Case in point: When I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/04/doordash-says-it-banned-driver-who-seemingly-faked-a-delivery-using-ai/\">something else</a>.

And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics — a startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/a-humanoid-robot-is-on-its-way-from-mobileye-founder/\">co-founded by Shashua</a> in 2022 — for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder, and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board’s consideration and approval, according to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye’s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,” Shashua said Tuesday. “By combining Mentee’s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye’s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits for Mobileye aren’t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition “broadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.” Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline — driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech — is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye’s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure — aka compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a “top 10 automaker” struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bill, dubbed SB 867, comes in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/trumps-ai-executive-order-promises-one-rulebook-startups-may-get-legal-limbo-instead/\">President Trump’s recent executive order</a> directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past year, lawsuits filed by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/lawsuit-blames-character-ai-in-death-of-14-year-old-boy/\">families</a> whose children <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\">died by suicide</a> after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots/\">passed SB 243</a>, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/folotoy-ai-bear-suspended-explicit-advice.html#:~:text=A.I.,of%20unexpected%20and%20unsafe%20chatter.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PIRG Education Fund warned </a>that toys like Kumma — a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot — could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-toys-gift-present-safe-kids-robot-child-miko-grok-alilo-miiloo-rcna246956\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NBC News found</a> that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/openai-and-barbie-maker-mattel-team-up-to-bring-generative-ai-to-toy-making-and-content-creation/\">“AI-powered product” in 2025</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/15/mattel-openai-toys-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delayed</a> their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-musical-lollipop-that-plays-ice-spice-in-your-head\">A musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080428\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=768,344 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=668,299 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=708,317 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LollipopStar.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Lollipop Star</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? <a href=\"https://www.lollipopstar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lollipop Star</a> showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth.

It will be built off of the company’s Intel Core Series 3 processors, known as Panther Lake, which was announced last year and is now being rolled out in a variety of PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This future platform includes a chip specifically for handheld gaming devices, according to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-intel-is-making-its-own-handheld-gaming-pc-chips-at-ces-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting from IGN</a>, which was confirmed by TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These Panther Lake chips are the company’s first built on its <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/intel-unveils-panther-lake-architecture-first-ai-pc-platform-built-on-18a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">18A </a>manufacturing process, which started production in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intel is no stranger to the gaming industry and has been building chips for gaming PCs since the 1990s. The company leaned more heavily into gaming in 2022 with the release of its <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Intel Arc GPUs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Entering the handheld gaming space would be an interesting development, though, as the market is currently dominated by AMD. AMD just announced a new processor designed for gaming PCs, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/amd-unveils-new-ai-pc-processors-for-general-use-and-gaming-at-ces/\">AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D</a>, in its CES keynote on Monday, in addition to new ray tracing and graphics technologies for gaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rogers said Intel will share more details about its new products for handheld gaming devices later this year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-for-the-first-official-day-with-ring-mobileye-siemens-robots-ai-and-more/\">annual CES conference</a> here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The round was led by Felicis and the university’s fund, UC Investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/lm-arena-the-organization-behind-popular-ai-leaderboards-lands-100m/\">$100 million seed round in May</a> at a $600 million valuation. This new round means it raised $250 million in about seven months.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LMArena is best known for its crowdsourced AI model performance leaderboards. Its consumer website lets a user type a prompt that it sends to two models, with the user then choosing which model did a better job. Those results, which now span more than 5 million monthly users across 150 countries and 60 million conversations a month, the company says, fuel the leaderboards. It ranks various models on a variety of tasks including text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other criteria.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The models it tests include various flavors of OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Grok, as well as ones that are geared toward specialties like image generation, text to image, or reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company began as Chatbot Arena, an open research project built by UC Berkeley researchers Anastasios Angelopoulos and Wei-Lin Chiang, and was originally funded through grants and donations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LMArena’s leaderboards became something of an obsession among model makers. When LMArena started pursuing revenue, it partnered with select model companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make their flagship models available for its community to evaluate. In April, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/study-accuses-lm-arena-of-helping-top-ai-labs-game-its-benchmark/\">a group of competitors published a paper</a> alleging that this helped those model makers game the startup’s benchmarks, an allegation LMArena has vehemently denied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, it publicly launched a commercial service, <a href=\"https://news.lmarena.ai/ai-evaluations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Evaluations</a>, in which enterprises, model labs, and developers can hire the company to perform model evaluations through its community. This gave LMArena an annualized “consumption rate” — as the company describes its annual recurring revenue (ARR) — of $30 million as of December, less than four months after launch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That trajectory, and the startup’s popularity, were enough for VCs to pile in for the Series A, which included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, The House Fund, LDVP, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Laude Ventures.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

HSI began investigating pcTattletale in mid-2021 as part of a wider probe into the industry of consumer-grade surveillance software, also known as “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#stalkerware\">stalkerware</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the first successful U.S. federal prosecution of a stalkerware operator in more than a decade, following the 2014 indictment and subsequent guilty plea of the creator of a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/seller-stealthgenie-cellphone-spyware-fined-500-000-n256311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">phone surveillance app called StealthGenie</a>. Fleming’s conviction could pave the way for further federal investigations and prosecutions against those operating spyware, but also those who simply advertise and sell covert surveillance software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HSI said that pcTattletale is one of several stalkerware websites under investigation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Kelly Thornton, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, which brought the charges against Fleming, declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming’s lawyer Marcus Bourassa did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">pcTattletale was a remote surveillance app that had been under Fleming’s control since at least 2016. Stalkerware apps like pcTattletale allow ordinary consumers to buy software capable of tracking people and their data without their knowledge, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\">including romantic partners and spouses</a>, which is illegal in the United States and many other countries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once physically planted on a person’s phone or computer (usually with knowledge of the victim’s passcode or login), the app would continuously upload a copy of the victim’s information, including messages, photos, and location data, to pcTattletale’s servers and make the data accessible to whoever planted the spyware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/pctattletale-spyware-shutters-data-breach/\">shut down pcTattletale</a> in 2024 following a data breach, which saw a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/25/spyware-app-pctattletale-was-hacked-and-its-website-defaced/\">hacker deface the company’s website and steal reams of data</a> from its servers, including identifiable information belonging to its customers and their victims. More than 138,000 customers who had signed up to use pcTattletale had their breached information shared with <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/pcTattletale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, Fleming told TechCrunch that his company was “out of business and completely done,” after deleting the contents of pcTattletale’s servers.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the shutdown, federal agents were already far into their investigation of Fleming’s illegal spyware business.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-feds-search-founder-s-1-2m-home\"><strong>Feds search founder’s $1.2M home</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HSI began investigating pcTattletale in June 2021 after finding over 100 stalkerware websites offering surveillance products, many of which advertised lawful uses of the software, such as monitoring children or employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">pcTattletale stood out because it was specifically advertising its spyware for “surreptitiously spying on spouses and partners,” wrote HSI special agent Nick Jones in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26458012-bryan-fleming-search-warrant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the 2022 affidavit</a> in support of a search warrant for Fleming’s home. The affidavit was unsealed in early December 2025 ahead of Fleming’s anticipated plea hearing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially for investigators, Fleming was believed to be operating pcTattletale from his home in Bruce Township, Michigan, well within reach of U.S. law enforcement — unlike many overseas stalkerware operators who are not.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike some stalkerware operators who shield their identities to avoid legal and reputational risks from working with spyware, Fleming was brazen in how he advertised pcTattletale. In <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260105175022/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL5uCPlUg2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">videos posted</a> on YouTube, Fleming could be seen at his home promoting pcTattletale as its creator and founder. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg\" alt=\"A surveillance photo taken by HSI agents showing Bryan Fleming's home in Michigan.\" class=\"wp-image-3080226\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg 1183w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=430,307 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=720,514 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=900,642 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=800,571 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=668,477 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=526,375 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=865,617 865w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=708,505 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bryan-fleming-pctattletale-surveillance-house.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1183px) 100vw, 1183px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A surveillance photo taken by HSI agents outside of Bryan Fleming’s home in Michigan</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Justice Department (affidavit)</span></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the affidavit, HSI obtained a warrant in 2022 allowing the search of Fleming’s email accounts. HSI said the emails showed that Fleming “knowingly assisted customers seeking to spy on nonconsenting, non-employee adults.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Federal agents later surveilled Fleming’s home to confirm it was in fact him. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jones also went undercover to collect evidence, posing as an affiliate marketer under the guise of promoting the spyware in exchange for a cut of the proceeds. As a result of this operation, Jones exchanged emails with Fleming, in which the pcTattletale founder provided images intended for banner ads that promoted the spyware as a way to “catch a cheater,” which made it clear Fleming wanted to market his product for illegal purposes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By November 2022, HSI had obtained permission from a U.S. judge to search Fleming’s home, which agents raided soon after, seizing an unknown number of items. Agents also obtained records associated with Fleming’s bank and his PayPal account, which had transactions totaling more than $600,000 as of the end of 2021. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The search warrant was filed under seal amid concerns that Fleming could destroy or tamper with evidence. Fleming has since sold the house for $1.2 million, <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/69951-Wildflower-Ln-18_Bruce-Twp_MI_48065_M99434-29527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per public records</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming’s conviction is a win for privacy advocates and campaigners who work to counter the proliferation of stalkerware and raise awareness to its dangers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the co-founder of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, who has investigated and fought stalkerware for years, commented on Fleming’s guilty plea when reached by TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the most striking aspects of this case is the extent to which stalkware companies like pcTattletale operate out in the open,” said Galperin. “This is because the people behind these companies so rarely face consequences for selling tools that they themselves say are explicitly for monitoring other people’s devices without their knowledge or consent.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I hope that this case changes the risk calculus for makers of stalkerware,” said Galperin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fleming is expected to be sentenced later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center wp-block-paragraph\">——</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence.

While that’s not sports tech per se, health and biotech are a natural niche for an athlete interested in human performance and wellness — and who has the freedom to pursue unconventional opportunities in those fields.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2020, Götze made headlines for <a href=\"https://cannareporter.eu/en/2021/01/13/gotze-and-schurrle-invest-in-german-medical-cannabis-start-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investing in German cannabis startup Sanity Group</a> when most European institutional investors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/13/8-cannabis-investors-share-their-outlook-on-the-european-market-in-h1-2022/\">wouldn’t touch cannabis with a 10-foot pole</a>. Since then, Germany has <a href=\"https://fortune.com/europe/2024/12/24/german-medical-cannabis-companies-predicted-to-bring-1-billion-2028/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">liberalized some aspects of its cannabis laws</a>, creating tailwinds for the startup that claimed <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240624359101/en/Organigram-Invests-in-Sanity-Group-a-Leading-German-Cannabis-Company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a 10% share</a> of the German medical cannabis market in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With cannabis still forbidden for athletes in competition, Götze will have to wait to try the stuff himself: The 33-year-old is still playing professionally at the top league level with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. But rather than waiting for retirement, he is taking cues from American athlete-investors such as NBA champion <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/how-living-in-silicon-valley-has-made-kevin-durant-a-better-investor/\">Kevin Durant</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Götze is not the only active European soccer player who also invests in startups — for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé <a href=\"https://athleticoventures.substack.com/p/insights-about-athlete-investors-53e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also do</a>. But as the father of two young daughters, he has to balance his various commitments. “I have to schedule calls before or after practices and align meetings with weeks when I don’t have away games or play Champions League,” Götze <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mario-goetze_how-to-combine-soccer-and-venture-in-one-activity-7406288512964243458-0lQD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Götze isn’t doing it all himself, but he is not simply entrusting others with his money either. Instead, he created Companion M as a small team that supports him with angel investing, partnerships, and other tasks. “These are important for myself as a brand, particularly in the long term, after [my] active career,” he <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mario-goetze_the-swiss-army-knife-or-an-army-of-experts-activity-7399817939773968385--sWV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">explained</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is an undeniable branding aspect to these efforts. When Götze became Revolut’s first-ever brand ambassador for Germany, the fintech company <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/revolut_were-pleased-to-announce-mario-g%C3%B6tze-as-activity-7237093412569575424-Igiv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cited</a> his track record as an angel investor as an incentive. But while preparing for his post-soccer career, Götze has found what he <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mario-goetze_being-a-professional-athlete-its-not-apparent-activity-7401614544554401793-KuNv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">describes</a> as “another passion apart from sport.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This passion may be less unexpected than it seems. While Götze and his brothers all became soccer players, their father Jürgen is a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of TU Dortmund University, and the family spent time in Houston, Texas, when Jürgen was visiting Rice University as a postdoctoral researcher.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not coincidentally, Götze mostly invests in Europe and in the U.S., with past investments including Miami-based <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/arcee-is-a-secure-enterprise-focused-platform-for-building-genai/\">Arcee AI</a> and Frankfurt-based <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/10/qualifyze-swallows-54m-to-improve-pharmaceutical-supply-chains/\">Qualifyze</a>. Several portfolio companies went on to raise significant amounts of follow-on funding, and he has already exited some, such as Berlin-based <a href=\"https://www.eu-startups.com/2024/11/berlin-based-koro-secures-e35-million-in-series-c-funding-to-drive-european-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">KoRo</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Exits give Götze capital to reinvest, but he’s also focused on long-term wealth consolidation. As a limited partner, Companion <a href=\"https://www.companion-m.com/funds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">backed more than 20 venture capital firms</a> on both sides of the Atlantic, including 20VC, Cherry Ventures, EQT Ventures, Planet A, Merantix, Visionaries Club, and World Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Götze is still under contract with his club and is reportedly <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/eintracht-frankfurt-mario-g-tze-203400931.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">discussing an extension</a>. But whenever he finally retires, these venture firms could count him as a peer. “After my career ends, I plan to focus on my investment activities,” he told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-29/german-football-star-mario-goetze-chases-gains-off-the-field\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>. But even then, don’t expect him to publish his anti-portfolio of startups he passed on and that later became huge successes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are plenty of new startups every year, and there will be some that you miss out on. But regretting past decisions leads to making uneducated or impulsive decisions in the future,” he told TechCrunch. Spoken like a true sportsman: Dwelling on what you missed won’t help you score the next goal.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A spokesperson for Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is internally prototyping the game and that it’s not available to the public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The game was first spotted by reverse engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2007873391865339907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development. Paluzzi shared a screenshot of the basketball game, which appears to let users virtually shoot hoops by swiping their finger. The idea behind the game is likely to allow friends to compete to see who can score the most baskets, similar to other mobile basketball games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launching in-message games would give Threads an edge over competitors like X and Bluesky, which don’t offer built-in games. It could also even help Threads compete with Apple’s Messages, which supports games via third-party apps like GamePigeon.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with any internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Meta plans to officially roll out games in Threads messages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time Meta has explored in-message gaming, as Instagram launched a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/bored-go-play-this-hidden-game-in-your-instagram-dms/\">hidden emoji game in DMs last year</a>. The goal of the game is to use your finger to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep an emoji of your choice afloat and continuously bouncing. If you let the emoji fall, you lose. The idea is to compete with the other person in the chat to achieve the highest score.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The internal prototype comes as Meta continues to build out Threads with new features to take on its competitors. For example, the platform recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/threads-adds-new-communities-tests-badges-for-highly-engaged-members/\">expanded its Communities feature</a> with more topics, likely aiming to draw users away from Reddit and X. Plus, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/threads-adds-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours-and-responses-go-to-dms/\">added a “disappearing posts”</a> feature that lets users share their thoughts and engage in conversations that are automatically archived after 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Threads boasts 400 million monthly users, it still has quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/11/20/americans-social-media-use-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pew Research Center’s report released a few weeks ago</a>. The report says 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">CFS and its competitors</a> are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Key components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"An engineer stands inside a superconducting magnet.\" class=\"wp-image-3080253\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-magnet-assembly.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Each magnet weighs 24 tons and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Commonwealth Fusion Systems</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/bill-gates-backed-commonwealth-fusion-systems-hits-key-reactor-construction-milestone/\">set in place last March</a>. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"An illustration shows a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor\" class=\"wp-image-3080254\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=2048,1154 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=1095,617 1095w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cfs-sparc-digital-twin.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">CFS is working with Nvidia and Siemens to produce a digital twin of the Sparc fusion reactor</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Commonwealth Fusion Systems</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">$863 million Series B2</a> round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since launching last fall, we’ve seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we’ve decided to pause our planned international expansion.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\">Unveiled</a> in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City. </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/watch-duty-surpasses-chatgpt-as-top-free-app-on-app-store-as-california-fires-spread/\">the fire monitoring app Watch Duty</a> to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates to this section using their Ring cameras.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the new devices being launched support Amazon’s Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company’s Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren’t in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions, and clothing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For people who subscribe to Amazon’s Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/amazons-new-alexa-feature-adds-conversational-ai-to-ring-doorbells/\">trigger Alexa responses</a> and send you <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
