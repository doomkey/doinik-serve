I’m not sure I would categorize it as such, but how about I let the journalist on the ground give his assessment? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Via Sean (and a few of my thoughts sprinkled in) after the event …</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was easy to get lost in the buzz words at times during Rivian’s “Autonomy &amp; AI Day” this week. But there was a clear underlying message being shared: Rivian is trying to build a company that is about more than just selling cars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not going as far as Tesla. For instance, there were no humanoid robots wandering around the company’s Palo Alto campus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it is clearly building out other revenue-generating products — and advanced driver assistance is at the starting gates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s hands-free version of its driver-assistance software — which today can be used on about 135,000 miles of road — will expand to 3.5 million miles and include surface streets. This expanded capability, which will launch in early 2026 and eventually include point-to-point hands-free (but eyes on) automated driving comes with a cost of $2,500 or $49.99 per month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there is its future hands-off, eyes-off system. Rivian revealed it has developed its own custom 5nm processor, which it says will be built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC. That chip will power Rivian’s “autonomy computer” — the backbone of an upgraded automated-driving system —that will debut in the R2 SUV in late 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That will probably be an upcharge, although Rivian didn’t say if it would be more than the $2,500 fee. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there’s another scenario we should also consider: licensing its tech to others. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After all, Rivian already has a joint venture with Volkswagen Group to share its electrical architecture and base-level software. And Rivian spun out two startups this year with Also (mobility) and Mind Robotics (industrial AI and robotics). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Barclays’ Dan Levy wrote Friday that “subsequent discussions reiterated hopes/potential” for Rivian to license its whole AV platform, or just components like the customs processor. And when I asked <strong>CEO RJ Scaringe</strong> if Rivian will sell the processor to Mind Robotics, he responded wryly: “It doesn’t take a lot of imagination.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the most abstracted level, bolting new revenue lines to the existing car business (especially if those new projects play nice with the cars) makes sense. Who doesn’t love more money?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Here’s our coverage of the event:</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/rivian-is-building-its-own-ai-assistant/\">Rivian is building its own AI assistant</a> (deeper dive into the tech). <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivians-ai-assistant-is-coming-to-its-evs-in-early-2026/\">And it is coming to its EVs in early 2026</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\">Rivian goes big on autonomy with custom silicon, lidar, and a hint at robotaxis</a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nothing this week — or should I say, thanks for the tips, everyone, but there is nothing I can share yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, here’s a tiny tidbit to hold you over. As you read above, senior reporter Sean O’Kane was at <strong>Rivian</strong>’s<strong> AI &amp; Autonomy Day</strong> and one of the whispers he heard was about the company’s public demo of its AI assistant and concerns it might not work. Apparently, the testing the morning of the event was a bit touch and go.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alas, the public demo went just fine after one tense moment at the start. The risks are high for public demos, which is why many companies avoid them. Kudos to Rivian for going for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

But here we are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aircraft startup <strong>Boom Supersonic</strong> kicked off 2025 by breaking the sound barrier with its XB-1 demonstrator civil aircraft. And it’s ending the year with a plan to sell a version of its turbine engine as a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/boom-supersonic-raises-300m-to-build-natural-gas-turbines-for-crusoe-data-centers/\">stationary power plant</a>. Its first customer will be data center startup <strong>Crusoe</strong>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the deal, Crusoe will buy 29 of Boom’s 42-megawatt turbines for $1.25 billion to generate 1.21 gigawatts for its data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boom has raised $300 million to help commercialize this new business. The round was led by Darsana Capital Partners with participation from Altimeter Capital, Ark Invest, Bessemer Venture Partners, Robinhood Ventures, and Y Combinator. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan is to use money from its Superpower stationary turbine business to fund the development of its supersonic aircraft. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention …</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Self-driving trucks company <strong>Aurora Innovation</strong> made a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://ir.aurora.tech/news-events/press-releases/detail/129/detmar-selects-aurora-to-deploy-expanded-fleet-of-autonomous-trucks-for-major-energy-producer\">commercial agreement</a> with Detmar Logistics to autonomously transport frac sand in the Permian Basin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some deals don’t always work out, or they change. Take <strong>SK On</strong> and <strong>Ford</strong>, for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Four years ago,<strong> </strong>Ford and South Korean battery maker SK On struck a deal to form a joint venture and spend $11.4 billion to build factories in Tennessee and Kentucky that would produce batteries for the next generation of electric F-Series trucks.

A new investor is participating in the remaining portion of the primary, but TechCrunch could not confirm its specifics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WestBridge Capital is doubling down in the new round with a check of a similar size to its previous investment, the people said. The firm invested about $35 million to $40 million in Spinny’s Series F round earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the secondary portion of the transaction is being sold by Indian VC firm Fundamentum, according to the people, while Blume Ventures is also expected to pare part of its stake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accel, Fundamentum, and Blume Ventures did not respond to requests for comments. WestBridge Capital declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March, Spinny raised <a href=\"https://www.thearcweb.com/article/spinny-raises-seriesf-accel-flat-valuation-niraj-singh-LUH52tUbb3ZXgddn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$131 million</a> in the first part of its Series F round led by Accel, with participation from Fundamentum, before expanding the raise to <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/spinny-raises-40-million-from-westbridge-in-extended-funding-round-13119962.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about $170 million</a> in June to include WestBridge Capital. Those funds were earmarked to scale Spinny’s core used-car business. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the new round is being raised specifically to finance the acquisition of GoMechanic and invest in its platform, without drawing on the startup’s existing cash reserves, the people said. Earlier reports suggested Spinny could buy GoMechanic for <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/spinny-to-acquire-gomechanic-in-rs-450-crore-cash-plus-stock-deal-13665938.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">around ₹4.5 billion</a> (approximately $49.70 million) in a cash-and-stock deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A consortium led by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/distressed-indian-startup-gomechanic-acquired-by-lifelong-group-led-consortium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lifelong Group acquired GoMechanic</a> in 2023 after the startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/sequoia-india-backed-gomechanic-faces-severe-trouble/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">admitted to “grave errors” in its financial reporting</a>. The startup had previously been backed by high-profile investors, including Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, and SoftBank.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Spinny, acquiring GoMechanic would deepen its control across the used-car value chain. The Gurugram-based startup has built a large consumer-facing business, selling about 13,000 used cars a month, primarily directly to buyers and, to a lesser extent, to dealers through its auction platform. Spinny operates its own large reconditioning centers to refurbish vehicles before sale and relies on third-party service shops for after-sales servicing of customer cars — a gap GoMechanic could bring in-house.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GoMechanic would also act as a “two-way” funnel for Spinny, a person familiar with the matter said. The platform would service vehicles bought or sold through Spinny, and help attract car owners who may not yet be customers. That could help expand Spinny’s vehicle supply without significantly increasing customer acquisition costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition comes as India’s used-car market is projected to grow at a <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/indias-used-car-market-set-to-double-and-hit-10-million-mark-by-2030-indian-blue-book/article70276235.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">compound annual growth rate of about 10%</a> to roughly 9.5 million units by 2030, from nearly 6 million units today, per a recent report by Mahindra First Choice and Volkswagen Pre-owned Certified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The GoMechanic deal would mark Spinny’s latest move to broaden its footprint in India’s automotive market. In recent months, the startup has expanded beyond used-car sales by <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/used-car-marketplace-spinny-acquires-autocar-operator-haymarket-s-automotive-titles-in-india-12970812.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquiring auto publications</a> Autocar India, Autocar Professional and What Car?

According to the sheriff’s department, the footage shows that after dropping off the food and taking a photo, the woman appeared to spray a substance towards the food from a small aerosol can attached to her keychain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sheriff’s department said that using DoorDash records, detectives identified the woman as Kourtney Stevenson of Kentucky, who told local police in a phone call that she had been working for DoorDash while visiting her father, and that she’d used pepper spray to spray a spider. But the department also said that with an overnight low of 35 degrees Fahrenheit, “outdoor spiders in Indiana are not active and would not be capable of crawling on exposed surfaces.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Stevenson allegedly declined to come in for an interview, detectives obtained a warrant to arrest her for battery resulting in a moderate injury and consumer product tampering. She is now awaiting extradition to Indiana.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A DoorDash spokesperson said in a statement that Stevenson has been banned from the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have absolutely zero tolerance for this type of appalling behavior,” the spokesperson said. “The Dasher’s access to the platform has been permanently removed, and our team is supporting law enforcement with their investigation.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/us/kentucky-delivery-driver-pepper-spray-food.html\">The New York Times</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doordash-driver-told-authorities-was-trying-spray-spider-rcna248953\">NBC News</a> both report that it’s not clear if Stevenson has a lawyer who can comment on her behalf.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Five minutes later, a man carefully pushed it out of everyone’s way, the words “I’m stuck” flashing yellow on the poor droid’s screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was an inauspicious start to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\">Rivian’s “Autonomy &amp; AI Day,”</a> a showcase for the company’s plans to make its vehicles capable of driving themselves. Rivian doesn’t make the cafeteria robot and isn’t responsible for its abilities, but there was a familiar message in its foibles: this stuff is hard.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hours later, as I rode in a 2025 R1S SUV during my 15-minute demo of Rivian’s new self-described “Large Driving Model,” I was reminded of that message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EV equipped with the automated-driving software drove myself and two Rivian employees on a switchback route near the company’s campus. As we glided past Tesla’s engineering office, I noticed a Model S in front of us slow to turn into the rival company’s lot. The R1S eventually noticed this, too, braking hard just before the Rivian employee nearly intervened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During my demo drive, there was one actual disengagement. The employee in the driver’s seat took over as we passed through a one-lane section of road due to some tree-trimming. Minor stuff overall. But it wasn’t exactly rare either; I spotted multiple <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0VXkDTt8dQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other demo rides</a> that had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0VXkDTt8dQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disengagements</a>, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rest of the drive went well enough for software that is not ready to be shipped, especially when you consider that Rivian threw out its old rules-based driver assistance system and adopted an end-to-end approach — which is how Tesla developed Full Self-Driving (Supervised). It stopped at stoplights, it handled turns, it slowed for speed bumps, all without programmed rules telling it to do these things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-quiet-pivot-in-2021\">A quiet pivot in 2021</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075742\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/r2-lidar.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Rivian</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian’s old system “was all very deterministic, and it was all very structured,” CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview Thursday. “Everything that the vehicle did was the result of a prescribed control strategy written by humans.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scaringe said that when Rivian saw transformer-based artificial intelligence taking off in 2021, he quietly “reconstituted the team and started with a clean sheet and said, let’s design our self-driving platform for an AI-centric world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After spending “a lot of time in the basement,” Rivian launched the new ground-up driving software in 2024 on its second-generation R1 vehicles, which use Nvidia’s Orin processors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scaringe said it was only recently that his company started to see dramatic progress “once the data started really pouring in.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is betting it can train its Large Driving Model (LDM) on fleet data so quickly that it will allow the company to roll out what it calls “Universal Hands-Free” later this month. That means Rivian owners will be able to take their hands off the wheel on 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada (so long as there are visible painted lines). In the back half of 2026, Rivian will allow “point-to-point” driving, or the consumer version of the demo we received Thursday.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-eyes-off-to-hands-off-challenge\">The ‘eyes off’ to ‘hands off’ challenge</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the end of 2026, after Rivian has started shipping its smaller, more affordable R2 SUVs, it will ditch the Nvidia chips and outfit those vehicles with a new custom autonomy computer unveiled Thursday. That computer, plus a lidar sensor, will eventually allow drivers to take their hands and eyes off the road. True autonomy — where a driver doesn’t have to worry about re-taking control of the vehicle — lies well beyond that and will largely depend on how fast Rivian can train its LDM.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This rollout introduces a near-term challenge for Rivian. The new autonomy computer and lidar won’t be ready until months after the R2 goes on sale. If customers want a vehicle that can handle eyes-off driving (or more), they’ll have to wait. But the R2 is a crucial product for Rivian, and the company needs it to sell well — especially in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/rivians-best-case-guess-for-2025-sales-is-a-16-drop-from-last-year/\">declining sales of its first-generation vehicles</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When tech is moving as fast as it is, there’s always going to be some level of obsolescence, and so what we want to do here is to be really direct” about what’s coming, Scaringe said. The early R2s will still get Rivian’s promised “point-to-point” driving, which will be based on the new software and will be hands-off but not eyes-off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So [if] you’re buying an R2 and you buy it in the first nine months, it’s just going to be more constrained,” he said. “I think what will happen is some customers will say ‘that matters a lot to me, and I’m going to wait.’ And some will say ‘I want the newest, best things now, and I’m going to get the R2 now, and maybe I’ll trade it in a year or two, and I’ll get the next version later. Fortunately, there’s so much demand backlog for R2 that we think, by being upfront with this, customers can make the decision themselves.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a perfect world, everything times at the same time, but the timeline of the vehicle and the timeline of the autonomy platform are just not perfectly aligned,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first interviewed</a> Scaringe in 2018, before Rivian even showed what its vehicles looked like, he shared a goal that still rattles around my head. He wanted to make Rivian’s vehicles so capable of driving themselves that: “if you go for a hike, and you start at one point and you finish at another point, you have the vehicle meet you at the end of the trail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was the kind of pie-in-the-sky promise about self-driving cars that was all the rage seven years ago, but it stuck with me at least because it was something that felt true to Rivian’s whole brand of aspirational adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scaringe told me Thursday he still thinks it’s possible for Rivian to enable a use case like that in the next few years. It certainly won’t happen until the company tests and builds its more-capable R2 vehicles, which is at least a year away in a best-case scenario.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We could [do that]. It’s not been a huge focus,” he said. That could change as the company gets closer to level 4 autonomy, though, since by then the company will have its LDM trained on trickier roads without guiding features like lane lines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Then, it becomes a bit of a like, what’s the ODD [operational design domain]? Dirt roads, off road? Easy,” he said. Just don’t expect a Rivian driving itself up <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/537057/rivian-r1t-hells-gate-moab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hell’s Gate</a> in Moab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not putting any resources into rock crawling autonomously,” he said. “But in terms of getting to the trail head? For sure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to reflect that Rivian’s Universal Hands-Free update is coming later this month.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With the update, users will be able to control the transparency of the Lock Screen’s clock. The release follows an update that introduced a slider for controlling the opacity of Liquid Glass elements through the operating system, following user complaints that the changes made their iPhone or other Apple device too hard to read.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched with iOS 26, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/love-it-or-hate-it-apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-getting-mixed-reviews/\">new design language</a> for Apple devices turns various interface elements like buttons, sliders, and notifications semi-transparent. The elements also refract light, giving them the optical qualities of glass.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meant to modernize Apple’s operating systems and potentially prepare for a world where the operating system moves to AI smart glasses, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/love-it-or-hate-it-apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-getting-mixed-reviews/\">Liquid Glass received mixed reviews</a>. Some found that the transparency made their device difficult to use, as it became tricky to read key items, like notifications or the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">name of an artist in Apple Music</a>. In response to user complaints, Apple released a Liquid Glass tool in iOS 26.1 that allowed users to return their interface to a more “frosted” look, if desired.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the slider for the Clock’s “glassiness,” Apple is again rolling back the transparency of the Liquid Glass update, but in the form of another user-controlled customization feature, instead of a global change.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png\" alt=\"a lock screen featuring a new setting allowing users to change the Liquid Glass setting from glass to solid.\" class=\"wp-image-3075699\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=244,531 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0284.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1320px) 100vw, 1320px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>iPhone screenshot by TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These tweaks are notable as they telegraph that perhaps Apple isn’t standing 100% behind the design overhaul as being perfect as is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of the change is worth noting, too. Earlier this month, Apple confirmed the design executive behind the Liquid Glass makeover, Alan Dye, was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/meta-poaches-apple-design-exec-alan-dye-to-lead-new-creative-studio-in-reality-labs/\">leaving the company for Meta</a>. While it didn’t appear that Dye was pushed out, Apple replaced him with longtime Apple designer Stephen Lemay. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike Dye, Lemay’s career was spent in interface and interaction design — a skill set called for when it comes to fixing Liquid Glass, it can be argued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">iOS 26.2 brought other new features beyond the latest Liquid Glass tweak.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As in the betas, users can now create AirDrop codes to share with people not in their contacts, allowing them to become a “known” AirDrop contact for a 30-day period. The feature might make sense at work or in other scenarios where you need to share files or photos with someone not stored in your Contacts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also in iOS 26.2, the Reminders supports alarms; Apple News gains a Following tab at the bottom nav bar along with other navigation changes; Apple Music adds offline lyrics; and the Podcasts app adds AI-generated chapters for podcast episodes, a Podcast Mention feature for linking to other shows, and other changes. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple Watch owners will also now get a Sleep Score based on how well they slept and if they met their sleep goals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple also released several important security updates across its flagship products on Friday, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches, to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/google-and-apple-roll-out-emergency-security-updates-after-zero-day-attacks/\">patch vulnerabilities used in an active hacking campaign</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

She also changed her name to Michael, she told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She was partaking in an experiment called #WearthePants where <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decoding-algorithmic-suppression-why-platforms-need-you-awomosu--5dvse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">women tested</a> the hypothesis that LinkedIn’s new algorithm was biased against women. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For months, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decoding-algorithmic-suppression-why-platforms-need-you-awomosu--5dvse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some heavy LinkedIn</a> users complained about seeing drops in engagement and impressions on the career-oriented social network. This came after the company’s vice president of engineering, Tim Jurka, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-does-linkedin-feed-work-tim-jurka-oxraf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in August that the platform</a> had “more recently” implemented LLMs to help surface content useful to users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Michelle (whose identity is known to TechCrunch) was suspicious about the changes because she has more than 10,000 followers and ghostwrites posts for her husband, who has only around 2,000. Yet she and her husband tend to get around the same number of post impressions, she said, despite her larger following. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only significant variable was gender,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marilynn Joyner, a founder, also changed her profile gender. She’s been posting on LinkedIn consistently for two years and noticed in the last few months that her posts’ visibility declined. “I changed my gender on my profile from female to male, and my impressions jumped 238% within a day,” she told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Megan Cornish reported similar results, as did Rosie Taylor, Jessica Doyle Mekkes, Abby Nydam, Felicity Menzies, Lucy Ferguson, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-gender-switch-experiments-reveal-linkedin-bias-geri-stengel-ztfye/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">so on</a>.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/feed/putting-members-first-testing-and-measuring-how-content-appears-in-your-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said that</a> its “algorithm and AI systems do not use demographic information such as age, race, or gender as a signal to determine the visibility of content, profile, or posts in the Feed” and that “a side-by-side snapshot of your own feed updates that are not perfectly representative, or equal in reach, do not automatically imply unfair treatment or bias” within the Feed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Social algorithm experts agree that explicit sexism may not have been a cause, although implicit bias may be at work.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Platforms are “an intricate symphony of algorithms that pull specific mathematical and social levers, simultaneously and constantly,” <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandeis-marshall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Brandeis Marshall</a>, a data ethics consultant, told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The changing of one’s profile photo and name is just one such lever,” she said, adding that the algorithm is also influenced by, for example, how a user has and currently interacts with other content.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we don’t know of is all the other levers that make this algorithm prioritize one person’s content over another. This is a more complicated problem than people assume,” Marshall said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bro-coded\">Bro-coded</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7395827337994375168/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">#WearthePants</a> experiment began with two entrepreneurs — Cindy Gallop and Jane Evans.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They asked two men to make and post the same content as them, curious to know if gender was the reason so many women were feeling a dip in engagement. Gallop and Evans both <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/life-style/linkedin-algorithm-women-sexism-claims-b2872973.html\">have sizable followings</a> — more than 150,000 combined compared to the two men who had around 9,400 at the time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gallop reported that her post reached only 801 people, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decoding-algorithmic-suppression-why-platforms-need-you-awomosu--5dvse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">while the man who posted</a> the exact same content reached 10,408 people, more than 100% of his followers. Other women then took part. Some, like Joyner, who uses LinkedIn to market her business, became concerned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’d really love to see LinkedIn take accountability for any bias that may exist within its algorithm,” Joyner said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But LinkedIn, like other LLM-dependent search and social media platforms, offers scant details on how content-picking models were trained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marshall said that most of these platforms “innately have embedded a white, male, Western-centric viewpoint” due to who trained the models. Researchers find <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/50/3/1097/121961/Bias-and-Fairness-in-Large-Language-Models-A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">evidence of human biases like sexism and racism</a> in popular LLM models because the models are trained on human-generated content, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/mercor-an-ai-recruiting-startup-founded-by-21-year-olds-raises-100m-at-2b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">humans are often directly involved in post-training</a> or reinforcement learning. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, how any individual company implements its AI systems is shrouded in the secrecy of the algorithmic black box. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn says that the #WearthePants experiment could not have demonstrated gender bias against women. Jurka’s August statement said — and LinkedIn’s Head of Responsible AI and Governance, Sakshi Jain, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/feed/putting-members-first-testing-and-measuring-how-content-appears-in-your-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reiterated in another post</a> in November — that its systems are not using demographic information as a signal for visibility. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, LinkedIn told TechCrunch that it tests millions of posts to connect users to opportunities. It said demographic data is used only for such testing, like seeing if posts “from different creators compete on equal footing and that the scrolling experience, what you see in the feed, is consistent across audiences,” the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn has been noted for <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3594075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">researching and adjusting</a> its algorithm <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/23/1026825/linkedin-ai-bias-ziprecruiter-monster-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to try to provide a less biased</a> experience for users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s the unknown variables, Marshall said, that probably explain why some women saw increased impressions after changing their profile gender to male. Partaking in a viral trend, for example, can lead to an engagement boost; some accounts were posting for the first time in a long time, and the algorithm could have possibly rewarded them for doing so. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tone and writing style might also play a part. Michelle, for example, said the week she posted as “Michael,” she adjusted her tone slightly, writing in a more simplistic, direct style, as she does for her husband. That’s when she said impressions jumped 200% and engagements rose 27%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She concluded the system was not “explicitly sexist,” but seemed to deem communication styles commonly associated with women “a proxy for lower value.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stereotypical male <a href=\"https://online.utpb.edu/about-us/articles/communication/how-men-and-women-communicate-differently/#:~:text=While%20effective%20in%20fostering%20positive,reconvene%20tomorrow%20to%20check%20progress.%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">writing styles are believed to be more concise</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nilukakavanagh_i-studied-gender-and-language-as-part-of-share-7399077151548821504-OKwP/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAABR8GIBH2uMtvMDH5bwjrwfOvr0BaP4WD8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">writing style stereotypes for women</a> are imagined to be softer and more emotional. If an LLM is trained to boost writing that complies with male stereotypes, that’s a subtle, implicit bias. And <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/no-you-cant-get-your-ai-to-admit-to-being-sexist-but-it-probably-is/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as we previously reported</a>, researchers have determined that most LLMs are riddled with them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarah Dean, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell, said that platforms like LinkedIn often use entire profiles, in addition to user behavior, when determining content to boost. That includes jobs on a user’s profile and the type of content they usually engage with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Someone’s demographics can affect ‘both sides’ of the algorithm — what they see and who sees what they post,” Dean said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn told TechCrunch that its AI systems look at hundreds of signals to determine what is pushed to a user, including insights from a person’s profile, network, and activity. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We run ongoing tests to understand what helps people find the most relevant, timely content for their careers,” the spokesperson said. “Member behavior also shapes the feed, what people click, save, and engage with changes daily, and what formats they like or don’t like. This behavior also naturally shapes what shows up in feeds alongside any updates from us.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chad Johnson, a sales expert active on LinkedIn, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/grab-cup-360-brew-linkedins-new-algorithm-chad-johnson-rckjc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described</a> the changes as deprioritizing likes, comments, and reposts. The LLM system “no longer cares how often you post or at what time of day,” Johnson wrote in a post. “It cares whether your writing shows understanding, clarity, and value.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this makes it hard to determine the true cause of any #WearthePants results.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-people-just-dislike-the-algo\">People just dislike the algo</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevertheless, it seems like many people, across genders, either don’t like or don’t understand LinkedIn’s new algorithm — whatever it is. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shailvi Wakhlu, a data science consultant, told TechCrunch that she’s averaged at least one post a day for five years and used to see thousands of impressions. Now she and her husband are lucky to see a few hundred. “It’s demotivating for content creators with a large loyal following,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One man told TechCrunch he saw about a 50% drop in engagement over the past few months. Still, another man said he’s seen post impressions and reach increase more than 100% in a similar time span. “This is largely because I write on specific topics for specific audiences, which is what the new algorithm is rewarding,” he told TechCrunch, adding that his clients are seeing a similar increase. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in Marshall’s experience, she, who is Black, believes posts about her experiences perform more poorly than posts related to her race. “If Black women only get interactions when they talk about black women but not when they talk about their particular expertise, then that’s a bias,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researcher, Dean, believes the algorithm may simply be amplifying “whatever signals there already are.” It could be rewarding certain posts, not because of the demographics of the writer, but because there’s been more of a history of response to them across the platform. While Marshall may have stumbled into another area of implicit bias, her anecdotal evidence isn’t enough to determine that with certainty.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn offered some insights into what works well now. The company said the user base has grown, and as a result, posting is up 15% year-over-year while comments are up 24% YOY. “This means more competition in the feed,” the company said. Posts about professional insights and career lessons, industry news and analysis, and education or informative content around work, business, and the economy are all doing well, it said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If anything, people are just confused. “I want transparency,” Michelle said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, as content-picking algorithms have always been closely guarding secrets by their companies, and transparency can lead to gaming them, that’s a big ask. It’s one that’s unlikely ever to be satisfied. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to correct the spelling of Wakhlu’s name. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Legal experts and startups meanwhile say the order could prolong uncertainty, sparking court battles that leave young companies navigating shifting state requirements while waiting to see if Congress can agree on a single national framework. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/one-rule-trump-says-hell-sign-an-executive-order-blocking-state-ai-laws-despite-bipartisan-pushback/?_thumbnail_id=2812319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">order</a>, titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” directs the Department of Justice to set up a task force within 30 days to challenge certain state laws on the grounds that AI is interstate commerce and should be regulated federally. It gives the Commerce Department 90 days to compile a list of “onerous” state AI laws, an assessment that could affect states’ eligibility for federal funds, including broadband grants.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order also asks the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to explore federal standards that could preempt state rules and instructs the administration to work with Congress on a uniform AI law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order lands amid a broader push to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/the-race-to-regulate-ai-has-sparked-a-federal-vs-state-showdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rein in state-by-state AI rules</a> after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/us-senate-removes-controversial-ai-moratorium-from-budget-bill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">efforts</a> in Congress to pause state regulation stalled. Lawmakers in both parties have argued that without a federal standard, blocking states from acting could leave consumers exposed and companies largely unchecked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This David Sacks-led executive order is a gift for Silicon Valley oligarchs who are using their influence in Washington to shield themselves and their companies from accountability,” said Michael Kleinman, head of U.S. Policy at the Future of Life Institute, which focuses on reducing extreme risks from transformative technologies, in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto policy czar, has been a leading voice behind the administration’s AI preemption push.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even supporters of a national framework concede the order doesn’t create one. With state laws still enforceable unless courts block them or states pause enforcement, startups could face an extended transition period.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sean Fitzpatrick, CEO of LexisNexis North America, U.K., and Ireland, tells TechCrunch that states will defend their consumer protection authority in court, with cases likely escalating to the Supreme Court. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While supporters argue the order could reduce uncertainty by centralizing the fight over AI regulation in Washington, critics say the legal battles will create immediate headwinds for startups navigating conflicting state and federal demands. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Because startups are prioritizing innovation, they typically do not have … robust regulatory governance programs until they reach a scale that requires a program,” Hart Brown, principal author of Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt’s Task Force on AI and Emerging Technology recommendations, told TechCrunch. “These programs can be expensive and time-consuming to meet a very dynamic regulatory environment.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arul Nigam, co-founder at Circuit Breaker Labs, a startup that performs red-teaming for conversational and mental health AI chatbots, echoed those concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s uncertainty in terms of, do [AI companion and chatbot companies] have to self-regulate?” Nigam told TechCrunch, noting that the patchwork of state AI laws does hurt smaller startups in his field. “Are there open source standards they should adhere to? Should they continue building?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that he is hopeful Congress can move more quickly now to pass a stronger federal framework. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Gamino-Cheong, CTO and co-founder of AI governance company <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/9tH2CYVJMJcNlvgOh0f1Fx_PZt?domain=trustible.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trustible</a>, told TechCrunch the EO will backfire on AI innovation and pro-AI goals: “Big Tech and the big AI startups have the funds to hire lawyers to help them figure out what to do, or they can simply hedge their bets. The uncertainty does hurt startups the most, especially those that can’t get billions of funding almost at will,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that legal ambiguity makes it harder to sell to risk-sensitive customers like legal teams, financial firms, and healthcare organizations, increasing sales cycles, systems work, and insurance costs. “Even the perception that AI is unregulated will reduce trust in AI,” which is already low and threatens adoption, Gamino-Cheong said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gary Kibel, a partner at Davis + Gilbert, said businesses would welcome a single national standard, but “an executive order is not necessarily the right vehicle to override laws that states have duly enacted.” He warned that the current uncertainty leaves open two extremes: highly restrictive rules or no action at all, either of which could create a “Wild West” that favors Big Tech’s ability to absorb risk and wait things out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Morgan Reed, president of The App Association, urged Congress to quickly enact a “comprehensive, targeted, and risk-based national AI framework. We can’t have a patchwork of state AI laws, and a lengthy court fight over the constitutionality of an Executive Order isn’t any better.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

So it’s almost as if those photos go into the ether,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The addition, to some extent, is pushback against the growing trend of AI-generated content and “for you” feed-style algorithms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As people engage with those platforms more and more, something that has to be true and will be true is that people will still want to see more of their friends,” Sharp says. “The photos and videos you take will need to find a place where they can reach the intended audience.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?w=313\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075597\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg 1260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=768,1668 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=553,1200 553w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=332,720 332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=308,668 308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=245,531 245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_2607.jpg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Retro</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although nearly half (45.7%) of Retro’s users participate in the app on a daily basis, the Rewind feature could boost that engagement even higher.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To try Rewind, you can either launch it from the end of the row of shared photos, just past the “this week in” card, or from its more prominent position as the middle tab in the bottom navigation bar. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When launched, there’s a haptic response as the screen starts cycling through the older photos pulled from your camera roll. These memories aren’t being shared, but you can tap on the share icon if you feel inspired to send them to a friend or post them. In addition, you can opt to hide photos you’d rather not see (like those of an ex), or tap a “dice” icon to be taken to a random memory instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the iPod-inspired dial clicks back into your past, you’ll feel a subtle vibration as each new memory loads. You can also spin the dial to move forward or backward in time, watching the photos from months and years past flip by on the screen, pausing at those you want to view longer or share.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?w=313\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3075601\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=244,531 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0283.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Retro screenshot/TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can press and hold on any photo to see it uncropped, and when you share a photo, a timestamp is added at the bottom so friends will understand it’s not a new pic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While screenshots won’t appear in this photo archive, other photos — like those of receipts or whiteboards at work will show up, as they could still be interesting memories to you. (And if you come across a photo you don’t need to keep, deleting it from the app will also delete it from your camera roll.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea to look back at older photo memories is hardly new, of course.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/22/timehop-series-b-10-million-shasta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a startup called Timehop popularized the idea</a> of doing something more with our growing digital photo archives by allowing users to revisit old photos through its simple mobile app. Later, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/24/facehop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook copied the idea for its “On This Day” feature</a>, and photo-hosting services like Google Photos and Apple Photos added memories features of their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Sharp doesn’t believe these will be direct competitors for Retro. Facebook, over the years, has downranked friends’ content as its feed became filled with links, news, and ads. Meanwhile, people tend to think of Apple’s and Google’s photo apps more as utilities for managing and storing photos, not as social apps like Retro.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The researcher found the exposed token and tried to privately alert Home Depot to its security lapse but was ignored for several weeks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposure is now fixed after TechCrunch contacted company representatives last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Security researcher <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://benzimmermann.dev/\">Ben Zimmermann</a> told TechCrunch that, in early November, he found a published GitHub access token belonging to a Home Depot employee, which was exposed sometime in early 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he tested the token, Zimmermann said that it granted access to hundreds of private Home Depot source code repositories hosted on GitHub and allowed the ability to modify their contents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researcher said the keys allowed access to Home Depot’s cloud infrastructure, including its order fulfillment and inventory management systems, and code development pipelines, among other systems. Home Depot has hosted much of its developer and engineering infrastructure on GitHub since 2015, according to a <a href=\"https://github.com/customer-stories/homedepot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">customer profile on GitHub’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zimmermann said he sent several emails to Home Depot but didn’t hear back. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nor did he get a response from Home Depot’s chief information security officer, Chris Lanzilotta, after sending a message over LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zimmermann told TechCrunch that he has disclosed several similar exposures in recent months to companies, which have thanked him for his findings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Home Depot is the only company that ignored me,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that Home Depot does not have a way to report security flaws, such as a vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program, Zimmermann contacted TechCrunch in an effort to get the exposure fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch on December 5, Home Depot spokesperson George Lane acknowledged receipt of our email but did not respond to follow-up emails asking for comment. The exposed token is no longer online, and the researcher said the token’s access was revoked soon after our outreach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We also asked Lane if Home Depot has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if anyone else used the token during the months it was left online to access any of Home Depot’s internal systems. We did not hear back.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses.

For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT write essays?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT commit libel?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/the-great-pretender/\">Due to the nature of how these models work</a>, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We will see how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT</a> will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an app?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/chatgpts-mobile-app-revenue-saw-biggest-spike-yet-following-gpt-4o-launch/\">there is a free ChatGPT mobile app</a> for iOS and Android users.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the ChatGPT character limit?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an API?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/openai-launches-an-api-for-chatgpt-plus-dedicated-capacity-for-enterprise-customers/\">released</a> March 1, 2023.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How good is ChatGPT at writing code?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you save a ChatGPT chat?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. There are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/17/developers-are-looking-for-creative-ways-to-build-ai-powered-chatbot-assistants/\">multiple AI-powered chatbot</a> competitors such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.together.xyz/\">Together</a>, Google’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/what-is-google-gemini-ai/\">Gemini</a> and Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/anthropic-launches-claude-a-chatbot-to-rival-openais-chatgpt/\">Claude</a>, and developers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/theres-now-an-open-source-alternative-to-chatgpt-but-good-luck-running-it/\">creating open source</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meet-the-team-developing-an-open-source-chatgpt-alternative/\">alternatives</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out <a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this form</a>. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “<a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request</a>”.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">here</a> for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/jailbreak-tricks-discords-new-chatbot-into-sharing-napalm-and-meth-instructions/\">two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine</a> (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Australian mayor has publicly announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/06/australian-mayor-prepares-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">he may sue OpenAI for defamation</a> due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Futurism reported</a> the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">accused</a> of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several major school systems and colleges, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/as-nyc-public-schools-block-chatgpt-openai-says-its-working-on-mitigations-to-help-spot-chatgpt-generated-text/\">including New York City Public Schools</a>, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">not every educator agrees with</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have also been cases of ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">accusing individuals of false crimes</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is <a href=\"https://promptbase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PromptBase</a>. Another is <a href=\"https://chatx.ai/marketplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatX</a>. More launch every day.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT be detected?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/openai-releases-tool-to-detect-ai-generated-text-including-from-chatgpt/\">tests</a>, they’re inconsistent at best.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are ChatGPT chats public?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. But OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649806/chatgpt-chat-histories-bug-exposed-disabled-outage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">recently</a> disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/28/23575919/microsoft-openai-github-dismiss-copilot-ai-copyright-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">involved</a> in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is continually updated with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Hama Film’s booths not only print out the photos like a typical photo booth, but booths also upload the customers’ photos to the company’s servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vibecast, which owns Hama Film, has yet to respond to his messages alerting the company of the issues. Vibecast also hasn’t responded to several requests for comment from TechCrunch, nor did Vibecast’s co-founder Joel Park respond to a message we sent via LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of Friday, the researcher said the company has still not fully resolved the security flaw and continues to expose customers’ data. As such, TechCrunch is withholding specific details of the vulnerability from publication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Zeacer first found this flaw, he noted that it appeared that photos were deleted from the photo booth maker’s servers every two to three weeks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, he said, the pictures stored on the servers appear to get deleted after 24 hours, which limits the number of pictures exposed at any given time. But a hacker could still exploit the vulnerability he discovered each day and download the contents of every photo and video on the server. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before this week, Zeacer said at one point he saw more than 1,000 pictures online for the Hama Film booths in Melbourne. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This incident is the latest example of a company that, at least for a time, was not implementing certain basic and widely accepted security practices, such as rate-limiting. Last month, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/bug-in-jury-systems-used-by-several-us-states-exposed-sensitive-personal-data/\">TechCrunch reported that government contractor giant Tyler Technologies</a> was not rate-limiting its websites used for allowing courts to manage their jurors’ personal information. This meant anyone could break into any juror’s profile by running a computer script capable of mass-guessing their date of birth and their easy-to-guess numerical identifier. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Driverless cars are no longer restricted to the realm of sci-fi thanks to companies like Waymo deploying commercial robotaxi services in multiple cities. And a number of automakers, big and small, are trying to bring that same level of autonomy to personally owned vehicles over the next few years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that happens, what kinds of things could you do with a personal AV? Maybe you’ll be able to send it to pick up food or run errands — the hope of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/autolane-is-building-air-traffic-control-for-autonomous-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">company called Autolane</a>. Or, if you’re Tesla CEO Elon Musk, you think owners will want to deploy their cars into the world to offer rides to other people, creating a tidy, nearly effortless side-hustle.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hebron Sher, co-founder of Dallas-based Zevo, is eager to capitalize on all of the above. The company has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/zevos-ev-only-car-share-fleet-is-helping-tesla-owners-make-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">operating an EV-only car-share fleet</a> for a little over a year, and it’s now adding robotaxis, starting with a new company called Tensor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tensor is kind of an odd duck. The startup <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/758605/tensor-autox-autonomous-vehicle-robocar-personal-own-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sort of emerged earlier this year</a> from a previous Silicon Valley startup called AutoX that also had operations in China, and boldly claims that it will be the first to sell a fully autonomous car to regular consumers — in 2026, no less. Zevo says it will purchase up to 100 of Tensor’s cars and add them to its network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There aren’t a lot of details on timing, and Tensor still needs to show that it can build cars at any kind of scale and reliability, which are massive hurdles that have tripped up many other newcomers in recent years. (The company said in a statement that its “path to shipping is driven by the pacing of global regulatory approvals, not product limitations.) If it works, Zevo customers would essentially be able to borrow the Tensor AVs in what amounts to a sort of decentralized robotaxi service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement resembles the many heady-yet-ultimately-unmet promises that were made a decade ago, when the self-driving car hype first peaked. But with real robotaxis on the roads now, the idea seems a <em>little</em> more tangible this time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Tensor’s vision is to build a future where everyone owns their own Artificial General Intelligence — a personal AGI that enables more time, freedom and autonomy,” Hugo Fozzati, Tensor’s chief business officer, said in a statement. “For us, this partnership with Zevo is not only just a batch sale of our vehicles, but also enables individuals and micro-entrepreneurs to participate and profit from AV business in this AI era.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It won’t be Sher’s first bet on an unproven company. In October, Zevo announced a non-binding order of 1,000 vans from <a href=\"https://investors.ff.com/news-releases/news-release-details/faraday-future-founder-and-co-ceo-yt-jia-shares-weekly-14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">perpetually imperiled EV startup, Faraday Future</a>. Faraday, which has struggled for a decade to make and sell its flagship FF91 luxury SUV, recently resorted to importing more affordable electric vans from China and assembling them in the U.S. The company is supposed to assemble the first of those later this month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sher’s willingness to bet on these companies stems from two reasons. One is cost: Tensor and Faraday Future have nonexistent and bad track records, respectively, and so they’re willing to cut an attractive deal. More importantly, Sher said, these companies are more willing than a major OEM to allow Zevo to tightly integrate with their vehicles’ software — a crucial factor if you’re going to allow peer-to-peer sharing, especially of robotaxis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not only is it tougher to get legacy automakers to be similarly flexible, but Sher said their “tech freaking sucks.” With newcomers, he said, “the synergy of startup and startup, sort of mingling, commingling together, and saying, ‘Let’s build a solution side by side…’ I think I’ve really enjoyed that experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sher paints the Tensor deal as a win-win for both companies: Tensor gets an early customer and a shot to prove that its robocars are real and can do what it promises; Zevo gets a good deal and that deep software integration. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, he admits it’s a “calculated risk.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that’s what makes America great, you know, the fact that we do encourage startups to take risk,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to reflect that AutoX was headquartered in Silicon Valley.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It facilitates knowledge sharing from one user to other users. It is not a significant purpose of the site to enable interactions engaged in because of a particular user’s relationship with or interest in another user as a person […] Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become ‘friends’ with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events,” the filing reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/1pkbpw1/a_more_effective_approach_to_protecting_youth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> accompanying the filing, Reddit admin LastBluejay said the law carries “some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren’t,” the post reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit also points out that a significant portion of content on social media platforms is accessible without an account, and kids under 16 years old would be more easily protected if they were allowed to have accounts that could then be restricted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
