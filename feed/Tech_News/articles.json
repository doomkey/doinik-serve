The decision is in response to a recent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/\">change</a> Billboard made to its ranking formula, which continues to add more weight to paid, on-demand streaming compared with ad-supported, free streaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Billboard justified its decision to adjust its age-old formula by saying that the change will “better reflect an increase in streaming revenue and changing consumer behaviors.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, streaming now matters more than buying albums or songs, so it wants its charts to reflect that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, YouTube doesn’t like the new formula because it doesn’t want there to be much — if any — differentiation between free and paid streams, especially if the changes are meant to reflect how consumers today are enjoying music. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Billboard uses an outdated formula that weights subscription-supported streams higher than ad-supported. This doesn’t reflect how fans engage with music today and ignores the massive engagement from fans who don’t have a subscription,” a YouTube blog post published on Wednesday <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-billboard-chart-update/\">explains</a>. “Streaming is the primary way people experience music, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.riaa.com/growth-in-paid-subscription-streaming-drives-mid-year-2025-us-recorded-music-revenues-to-new-high-reports-riaa/\">making up 84%</a> of U.S. recorded music revenue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re simply asking that every stream is counted fairly and equally, whether it is subscription-based or ad-supported—because every fan matters and every play should count,” the post notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ranking changes will be reflected starting with the charts published on January 17, which will include data from January 2-8, 2026. This will impact the Billboard 200 lists and genre-based album charts. In addition, the ratio between paid/subscription and ad-supported on-demand streaming tiers will be adjusted to 2.5:1 for the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To protest the new formula, YouTube said it will no longer provide data to Billboard after January 16, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s what that change means in practice: Under the revised calculation, Billboard said it will take 33.3% fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20% fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit. In short, it will take fewer streams than before for an album to climb the charts. This is a win for streaming in general but not necessarily for YouTube.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s why. At present, the formula Billboard uses defines an album unit (the standard measurement for chart rankings) as one album sale. It counts 10 individual songs from an album as one album consumption unit, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the streaming side, it currently says an album unit equals 3,750 ad-supported streams — like YouTube’s  — or 1,250 paid/subscription official audio and video streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the changes, those figures will be adjusted, so it will take 2,500 ad-supported streams or 1,000 paid/subscription streams to count as one album unit. This means paid streams count 2.5x as much as ad-supported streams. While that’s less of a gap than the current 3:1 ratio, it’s still not what YouTube would prefer seeing here. The company is essentially doing what companies do in failed negotiations like this: it’s taking its ball and going home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, by not cooperating with Billboard, YouTube’s music data won’t be considered in chart rankings, which could lead labels and artists to deprioritize publishing their music on YouTube. That’s not a good long-term strategy for YouTube as an important player in the streaming music era. That’s why this move should be viewed as the negotiation tactic it is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are committed to achieving equitable representation across the charts and hopefully can work with Billboard to return to theirs,” YouTube’s announcement concludes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Google-owned platform outbid other contenders, including the Oscars’ longtime home ABC, ending the network’s streak of hosting the awards show since 1976 (with the exception of a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/oscars-youtube-2029-abc-deal-ends/6432302/\">brief period</a> in the early 1970s).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube’s first show will be the 101st Oscars in 2029, and its deal will run through 2033. ABC will continue to broadcast the ceremony until 2028.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news, which marks a landmark shift for one of television’s marquee events, highlights YouTube’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">growing dominance in the television space</a> and a major shift as streaming takes on more live events. The ceremony will be available live and for free to more than 2 billion viewers globally on YouTube, as well as to YouTube TV subscribers in the United States. The move comes as Oscar ratings have steadily fallen from a peak of 55 million viewers in 1998 to closer to 20 million in recent years, prompting the Academy to explore new ways to reach audiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,” said Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor in a joint statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible — which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, YouTube will not only broadcast the ceremony, but also red carpet coverage, behind-the-scenes content, the Oscar nominations announcement, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, Governors Ball access, film education programs, podcasts, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,” YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. “Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars’ storied legacy.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although this isn’t the first time a streamer has acquired the rights to an awards show — Netflix <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/netflix-gets-live-streaming-rights-to-sag-awards-in-2024/\">has secured</a> rights to the SAG Awards — it’s the first time one of the big four awards shows (Emmys, Grammys, Oscars, and Tonys) will leave broadcast TV entirely in favor of streaming.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The program was part of the company’s metaverse push — the idea behind the program was to create a “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/\">new generation of hardware</a>” that would give VR users their pick of devices when it came to engaging with Meta’s digital worlds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have paused the program to focus on building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for third-party device partnerships as the category evolves.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news was<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-third-party-headset-cancelled-asus-lenovo/#google_vignette\"> originally reported</a> by <em>Road to VR</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last April, the tech giant<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/\"> announced that</a> it would be opening up Meta Horizon OS to third-party headset makers. At the time, the company said that Asus, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Lenovo, were all working on creating new hardware that would run the company’s software. “As we’ve seen with the PC and smartphone industries, consumers are best served by a broad hardware ecosystem producing both general-purpose computing devices and more specialized products, all running on a common platform,” the company said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Between the announcement of the partner program and now, there haven’t been a whole lot of updates about it. In September, at the company’s Connect event, a Meta spokesperson<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-asus-lenovo-quest-connect-2025/\"> said that</a> Meta was still working with its business partners to push Horizon OS into more devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Horizon OS was designed to deliver “mixed reality experiences,” and to communicate “social presence” through technologies like hand, body, eye, and face tracking. It launched in the days when Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-lays-out-the-future-of-meta-140009379.html\">still maintained that</a> the metaverse was the “future” of his company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately for Horizon and the coders who work on it, Meta and its top executive have seemed less and less interested in the metaverse in recent times, as AI becomes a larger focus for the company. Earlier this month, Bloomberg<a href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-zuckerberg-plans-deep-cuts-063541372.html\"> reported that</a> the metaverse group within Reality Labs, Meta’s unit focused on VR and AR hardware, was facing potential budgetary cuts as high as 30%. The company subsequently<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/technology/meta-cuts-metaverse-unit.html\"> confirmed that</a> it was planning on “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables given the momentum there.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Worse, there are no patches available at this time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-attack-N9bf4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In a security advisory</a>, Cisco said it discovered a hacking campaign on December 10 targeting Cisco AsyncOS software, and in particular the physical and virtual appliances Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager. The advisory said affected devices have a feature called “Spam Quarantine” enabled and are reachable from the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cisco noted that this feature is not enabled by default and does not need to be exposed to the internet, which may be good news. <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@mttaggart/115735885528149384\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Michael Taggart</a>, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health Sciences, told TechCrunch that “the requirement of an internet-facing management interface and certain features being enabled will limit the attack surface for this vulnerability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, <a href=\"https://elk.zone/infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/115736098425798888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kevin Beaumont</a>, a security researcher who tracks hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that this appears to be a particularly problematic hacking campaign since a lot of big organizations use the affected products, there are no patches available, and it’s unclear how long the hackers had backdoors in the affected systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this point Cisco is not saying how many customers are affected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, Cisco spokesperson Meredith Corley did not answer a series of questions, and instead said that the company “is actively investigating the issue and developing a permanent remediation.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this hacking campaign?

It is not clear if this signal pushed the company to experiment with limits on link sharing, however. The company said that the majority of the 1.9% of views of posts with links came from a page they followed. Linked posts shared by friends and groups were minimal.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076972\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg 738w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=668,352 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=708,373 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same report noted that YouTube and TikTok, along with GoFundMe, were the top domains amid the links posted.

At AWS’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/all-the-biggest-news-from-aws-big-tech-show-reinvent-2025/\">re:Invent</a> event, Amazon hammered home its commitment to AI for enterprise use, so it makes sense that the company is spinning out a new team from AWS leadership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s increasing emphasis on AI comes at a time when the company is eager to strengthen its foothold in the AI race, perhaps more through investments than its own innovations. Last month, AWS <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/aws-is-spending-50b-build-ai-infrastructure-for-the-us-government/\">announced</a> a $50 billion investment in the U.S. government’s AI infrastructure. Amazon is also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, and has already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/22/anthropic-raises-an-additional-4b-from-amazon-makes-aws-its-primary-cloud-partner/\">invested</a> $8 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Some of those companies have re-emerged, though, with VanMoof and Cake finding new owners during their respective court-led restructuring processes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad itself had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/rad-power-bikes-faces-shutdown-in-january-without-new-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told employees</a> in November that there had been a “very promising” option to keep the company afloat that was “likely to close,” but the deal fell apart. The company has not shared more details about that potential deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weeks later, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/rad-power-bikes-batteries-receive-major-fire-risk-warning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">warning</a> that older Rad Power batteries posed “a risk of serious injury and death” after receiving 31 reports of fires. Rad Power said it “strongly disagrees” with the CPSC’s characterizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad’s tough November came at the end of a fairly tumultuous few years for the company. It has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/rad-power-bikes-ceo-steps-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">swapped CEOs</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/rad-power-bikes-already-has-a-new-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earlier this year</a>, bringing in an executive with decades of experience turning around underperforming companies. That new CEO, Kathi Lentzsch, said Rad was shifting away from the direct-to-consumer model that had helped fuel its rise and toward a retail-focused approach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This shift creates new opportunities to reach more riders, strengthen customer relationships, and evolve the brand in meaningful ways,” she said in a statement at the time. “[I]t’s an incredible time to come on board.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it entered the bankruptcy process with $32 million in assets and $73 million in liabilities. More than $8 million of its debt was owed to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency for unpaid tariffs. (The company has listed this claim as “disputed” in the bankruptcy paperwork.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how much that contributed to Rad’s slide into bankruptcy. But it wouldn’t be the first time that Donald Trump’s tariffs helped push a micromobility company over the edge. During his first term, Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22575594/boosted-electric-skateboard-khosla-lime-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">helped take the remaining wind out of</a> electric skateboard company Boosted’s sails.

Heck, Radiant itself raised $165 million <a href=\"https://www.radiantnuclear.com/blog/series-c-close/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">just six months ago</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the string of investments, it seems reasonable to ask whether the nuclear world is in a bubble. Investment in the technology has tracked closely with the data center boom. AI requires tremendous amounts of electricity, and tech companies and data center developers have been rushing to secure supplies from sources ranging from nuclear fission to supersonic jet engines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As long as tech companies’ power demands continue to grow, interest in nuclear is likely to remain strong. But there might be a winnowing of the field in the next year or two if startups don’t deliver on their promises, many of which revolve around starting their first reactor next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some startups might be able to buy some time after that. First-of-a-kind reactors can be built by hand, but many nuclear startups are predicated on the idea that mass manufacturing will make fission cost-competitive. They might succeed at reaching criticality but stumble when they try to replicate their designs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of this is to say that Radiant will fall into that category; it may very well succeed. Rather, the company just happens to be the latest in a long list of nuclear startups that have announced eye-popping fundraises in the last few months. Anytime a market gets that frothy, the B-word is bound to pop up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Draper Associates and Boost VC with participation from Ark Venture Fund, Chevron Technology Ventures, Friends &amp; Family Capital, Founders Fund, and others. It values Radiant at more than $1.8 billion. Previous investors include Andreessen Horowitz, DCVC, Giant Ventures, and Union Square Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Radiant is developing a microreactor capable of generating 1 megawatt of electricity that can be delivered via semi. It will be cooled by helium and will have enough TRISO fuel — carbon and ceramic-coated beads of graphite and uranium that are designed to be more resistant to meltdowns — to last five years between refueling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is aiming to replace diesel generators at commercial and military sites. Customers will be able to buy the units outright or subscribe to a power-purchase agreement. When the reactor’s 20-year lifetime is up, the company will haul it away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like many nuclear startups, Radiant is targeting data centers as some of its first customers. The company signed a deal with data center developer Equinix in August to supply 20 of its reactors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, Radiant is building a demonstration reactor at the Idaho National Lab, which it hopes to begin testing in the summer of 2026. Many nuclear startups are on a similar timeline, one set by the Trump administration’s goal of three reactors achieving criticality — the moment when a nuclear reaction is self-sustaining — by July 4, 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Radiant is one of 11 companies selected for that program, which doesn’t provide government grants or loans but instead speeds approval timelines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction 1:20 pm ET: Radiant’s reactor will be refueled once every five years, not months as previously stated.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is also making this the default model in the Gemini app and AI mode in search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Flash model arrives six months after Google announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/googles-newest-gemini-ai-model-focuses-on-efficiency/\">the Gemini 2.5 Flash mode</a>l, offering significant improvements. On the benchmark, the Gemini 3 Flash model outperforms its predecessor by a significant margin and matches the performance of other frontier models, like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT 5.2, in some measures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, it scored 33.7% without tool use on <a href=\"https://scale.com/leaderboard/humanitys_last_exam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark,</a> which is designed to test expertise across different domains. In comparison, Gemini 3 Pro scored 37.5%, Gemini 2.5 Flash scored 11%, and the newly released GPT-5.2 scored 34.5%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the multimodality and reasoning benchmark MMMU-Pro, the new model outscored all competitors with an 81.2% score. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consumer-rollout\">Consumer rollout</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is making Gemini 3 Flash the default model in the Gemini app globally, replacing Gemini 2.5 Flash. Users can still choose the Pro model from the model picker for math and coding questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new model is good at identifying multimodal content and giving you an answer based on that. For instance, you can upload your pickleball short video and ask for tips; you can try drawing a sketch and have the model guess what you are drawing; or you can upload an audio recording to get analysis or generate a quiz.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also said the model better understands the intent of users’ queries and can generate more visual answers with elements like images and tables.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also use the new model to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/googles-vibe-coding-tool-opal-comes-to-gemini/\">create app prototypes</a> in the Gemini app using prompts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Gemini 3 Pro is now available to everyone in the U.S. for search and more people in the U.S. can access the Nano Banana Pro image model in search, as well.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-enterprise-and-developer-availability\">Enterprise and developer availability</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google noted that companies like JetBrains, Figma, Cursor, Harvey, and Latitude are already using the Gemini 3 Flash model, which is available through Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For developers, the company is making the model available in a preview model through the API and in Antigravity, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">Google’s new coding tool released last month</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said the Gemini 3 Pro scores 78% on the SWE-bench verified coding benchmark, only outperformed by GPT-5.2.

The companies said the merger will be finalized in the second half of next year, pending regulatory review and shareholder approval.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This agreement comes at a challenging time for both Udemy and Coursera, as each faces market headwinds. Despite both companies posting revenue growth in the <a href=\"https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2025/Coursera-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">third quarter</a> of 2025, their share prices declined, underscoring investors’ lack of confidence in the platforms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a <a href=\"https://www.courseraandudemy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">combined company</a>, Udemy and Coursera aimed to reassure shareholders, suggesting that the combined strengths of both platforms could deliver both immediate returns as well as long-term growth potential.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Through this combination with Coursera, we will create meaningful benefits for our learners, enterprise customers, and instructors, while delivering significant value to our shareholders, who will participate in the substantial upside potential of the combined company,” Udemy CEO Hugo Sarrazin said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Additionally, as the online learning market continues to expand — particularly with the adoption of AI — Sarrazin said the merger will accelerate plans to introduce AI-powered products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Coursera recently announced an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/\">integration</a> with OpenAI’s ChatGPT app ecosystem and a <a href=\"https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2025/Coursera-Partners-with-Anthropic-and-Launches-New-AI-Content-to-Drive-Responsible-AI-Innovation-and-Workforce-Transformation-at-Scale/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">content partnership</a> with Anthropic.

Job postings requiring AI skills have surged in the past few years, and according to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91394155/1-in-3-hiring-managers-wont-hire-workers-who-dont-have-ai-skills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one survey</a>, one in three hiring managers wouldn’t consider candidates without them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re at a pivotal moment in which AI is rapidly redefining the skills required for every job across every industry. Organizations and individuals around the world need a platform that is as agile as the new and emerging skills learners must master,” added Coursera CEO Greg Hart.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

To work, the app matches you with friends from your saved contacts in your phone’s address book — but only if both people have opted in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Contact import has always been the most effective way to find people you know on a social app, but it’s also been poorly implemented or abused by platforms,” the company explained in its <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/12-16-2025-find-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a>. “Even with encryption, phone numbers have been leaked or brute-forced, sold to spammers, or used by platforms for dubious purposes. We weren’t willing to accept that risk, so we developed a fundamentally more secure approach that protects your data.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, social apps in the past often used contact matching as a lead-generation tool. That is, if the app found you had friends who were not on its service, it would recommend you “add” them. This would then send the friend an invite via text. Typically, those on the receiving end would not appreciate this app spam, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/07/path-uploads-your-iphones-address-book-to-their-servers-without-a-peep/\">method</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/dont-get-played-by-this-spammy-app-like-i-did/\">has</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/26/photo-sharing-app-lapse-hits-top-of-the-app-store-by-forcing-you-to-invite-your-friends/\">long</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/everalbum-is-proof-that-sms-spam-still-works/\">been</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/\">effective</a>, and it helped apps go viral, as at least some of the invited users would download and try the app out of curiosity. But despite the initial buzz this method can create, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/creator-of-gas-and-tbh-makes-an-app-for-disappearing-photos-via-imessage/\">it’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse-buzz-is-already-fading-but-andreessen-horowitz-isnt-put-off.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">not a guaranteed way</a> to lock in users for the long term. (Though it may help a social app <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/17/discord-acquires-gas-a-compliments-based-social-media-app-for-teens/\">find</a> an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run/\">exit</a>, when the market is open to M&amp;A!)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky states that it won’t send automated invites to your contacts, even if you choose to upload your address book to its service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, it allows users to send an invite to a friend directly — but this is a deliberate, manual action a user must take. (Because these are personal messages from a friend, you can’t opt out of receiving invites, however.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?w=680\" alt=\"screenshots showing Bluesky's contact matching feature\" class=\"wp-image-3076894\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=300,236 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=768,603 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=680,534 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=1200,943 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=1280,1006 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=430,338 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=720,566 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=900,707 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=800,629 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=668,525 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=477,375 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=785,617 785w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=676,531 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/find-friends.png?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the Find Friends feature, you’ll first verify your phone number by entering the six-digit code sent to you via SMS before uploading your contacts. This prevents bad actors from uploading random numbers in order to fish for information about Bluesky users, the company notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early adopters should note that contact matching may take some time, but more people will begin showing up in this screen as more Bluesky users upload their own contacts to be matched. You’ll only be matched with friends if both you and your friend have each other in your respective address books. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’d rather not be found by those you know from work or your real life, you can simply choose not to use the feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky says it stores uploaded contact information in hashed pairs, where your number is combined with each contact’s number. This makes the data harder to reverse engineer, the company claims. The data’s encryption is tied to a hardware key that’s stored separately from the Bluesky database, as well. If you later want to remove your data from Bluesky, you can delete your uploaded contacts and opt out. Details on the technology were already made <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/contact-import-rfc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">available to the security community as an RFC</a>, in order to solicit feedback ahead of the launch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is rolling out now to Bluesky users in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the U.K., and the United States.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After more than a decade of dominating the market, incumbents like Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple’s Safari are facing a fresh challenge from companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Perplexity</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/\">Arc</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/\">OpenAI</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/opera-wants-you-to-pay-20-a-month-to-use-its-ai-powered-browser-neon/\">Opera</a>, which are focused on baking AI models and agents into their browsers to bring AI to users at the first point of contact with the internet: the web browser.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These changes don’t seem to be lost on Mozilla, which <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/organizations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">consists of several organizations</a>, one of which is the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox and other technologies, and another of which is its nonprofit and tax-exempt Mozilla Foundation, which oversees Mozilla’s corporate governance structure and sets the browser maker’s policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has had a tough time lately: It’s gone through a restructuring, and last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/mozilla-foundation-lays-off-30-staff-drops-advocacy-division/\">laid off 30% of its employees</a> and dropped its advocacy and global programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the potential to make a comeback amid the modern browser wars doesn’t seem to be lost on the company.

To use the feature, users describe in natural language the app they want to make, and the tool will use the different Gemini models to create it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Opal is directly available from Gemini on the web, where it’s found in the Gems manager. The tool has a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/opal/overview#visual_editor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visual editor</a> that lays out the steps required to create an application. From the editor, users can rearrange steps and link them together, without writing code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that the visual editor also includes a new view in Gemini that will take the user’s written prompts and turn them into a list of steps. This makes it even easier to build apps and see how they work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For more advanced customization options, users can move from Gemini to the Advanced Editor at <a href=\"http://opal.google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opal.google.com</a>. The mini apps can be reused after they’re created.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Known as “vibe-coding,” using AI to program and make apps has skyrocketed in popularity over the past couple of years.

But coming up to transmit poses the very obvious risk of being exposed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.skanarobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Skana Robotics</a> thinks it’s made a breakthrough with underwater communications using AI — but not the large language models the industry touts today.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tel Aviv-based Skana has developed a new capability for its fleet management software system, SeaSphere, that allows groups of vessels to communicate with each other underwater across long distances using AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system allows vessels to share data and react to what they hear from other robots. This, Skana says, gives individual units the ability to autonomously adapt to the information they receive and change their course or task while still working toward the same general mission as the fleet. The startup says its software can also be used to secure underwater infrastructure and supply chains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Communication between vessels is one of the main challenges during the deployment of multi-domain, multi-vessel operations,” Idan Levy, the co-founder and CEO of Skana Robotics, told TechCrunch. “The problem that we tackle is how you can deploy hundreds of unmanned vessels in an operation, share data, communicate on the surface level and under the water.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teddy Lazebnik, an AI scientist and professor at the University of Haifa in Israel, led the research to develop this new capability. Lazebnik told TechCrunch that to build this decision-making algorithm, they couldn’t turn to the latest AI technology, but had to use AI algorithms that are a bit older and more mathematically driven.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The new algorithms have two properties: they are more powerful, but as a result, are less predictable,” Lazebnik said. “Hypothetically, you’re paying in the performance or the ‘wow effect’ of the of this algorithm, but the older ones, you gain explainability, predictability, and actually generality.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skana Robotics was founded in 2024 and exited stealth mode earlier this year. The company is currently focused on selling to governments and companies in Europe, as maritime threat levels increase due to the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Levy said the company is in talks for a sizable government contract that it hopes to close by the end of the year. In 2026, Skana hopes to release the commercial version of its product and start proving its tech out in the wild.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to show we can use this in scale,” Lazebnik said. “We argue that our software can handle complex maneuvers, etc. We want to show it. We claim we know how to manage an operation. We want admirals from EU and in EU countries to actually check this argument and see by themselves that we actually get results.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That gap has created an opportunity for technology companies and banks to embed lending into widely used payments apps, helping explain Google’s move into the space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flex by Google Pay is issued digitally through the Google Pay app and can be used both online and at physical merchants, the company said. Built on the Indian government-backed RuPay network, the card includes a rewards program that credits virtual “Stars” on transactions, with each Star worth ₹1. Users can monitor spending and bills within the app, choose to repay balances in full or convert them into installments, and manage security settings such as blocking the card or resetting a PIN.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch builds on Google Pay’s broader effort to expand access to credit in India, where it has already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/google-pay-deepens-consumer-and-merchant-lending-offerings-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnered with banks and non-bank lenders</a> to <a href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/outreach-initiatives/google-for-india-2024-bringing-ai-to-every-indian-across-our-products/#:~:text=3.%20Expanding%20Financial%20Inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">offer personal</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/google-taps-india-love-for-gold-to-boost-its-credit-play/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gold-backed loans</a> through the app. As one of the country’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/29/indias-mobile-payments-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most widely used UPI platforms</a>, Google Pay offers Axis Bank access to a large, digitally active user base at a time when lenders are increasingly looking to scale credit distribution through technology platforms rather than physical branches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Google has started with Axis Bank, it aims to add more issuer partners soon to expand its co-branded credit card offering in India.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076601\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg 1740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1200,788 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1280,840 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=430,282 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=720,473 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=900,591 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=800,525 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1536,1008 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=668,438 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=571,375 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=940,617 940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=708,465 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1740px) 100vw, 1740px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pricing on the card, including interest and applicable charges, will vary by user and credit profile, with no application fee, Google said, adding that charges linked to repayment choices are shown upfront in the app. Processing fees apply to EMI conversions, and late-payment charges will be levied in line with the issuing bank’s policy.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s credit card market has been expanding rapidly in recent years. The number of outstanding cards has grown at an annual rate of about 14% over the past three years to around 110 million, while transaction volumes and values have risen at close to 30%, per a recent <a href=\"https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/indian-payments-handbook-2025-2030.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PwC report</a> (PDF). Average annual spending per card has increased from about ₹132,000 (around $1,450) to roughly ₹192,000 (about $2,100), suggesting cards are being used more frequently for routine payments rather than occasional big-ticket purchases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite growth in the number of outstanding cards and credit card spending in India, the expansion has largely been driven by existing users rather than a meaningful increase in the number of cardholders. Google aims to help address that gap by bringing new users into the credit system, particularly those wary of traditional card repayment structures. “It’s the same users getting more and more credit,” said Sharath Bulusu, senior director of product management for Google Pay, adding that flexible repayment options are designed to ease concerns around unpredictable billing for first-time credit users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think we now understand the problem, the space, and the user well enough to solve something uniquely for them,” Bulusu told TechCrunch, explaining Google’s timing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s move comes amid growing competition in India’s co-branded credit card market, where companies including Amazon, as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart and PhonePe, already offer similar products. Consumer internet platforms such as food delivery firms Swiggy and Zomato, along with online travel companies including MakeMyTrip and Yatra, have also entered the space in partnership with banks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-branded credit cards accounted for about 12-15% of India’s total credit cards in the financial year ended 2024 and are projected to capture more than a quarter of the market by volume by 2028, growing at an annual rate of 35-40%, according to a <a href=\"https://redseer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hyperface-Redseer-Report-The-Rise-of-Co-branded-Credit-Cards-3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report</a> (PDF) by consultancy firm Redseer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the co-branded card launch, Google is also rolling out “Pocket Money,” a feature in the Google Pay app that lets parents give children limited access to digital payments. Built on the recently introduced UPI Circle functionality, the feature lets parents set a monthly spending cap of up to ₹15,000 or approve individual transactions initiated by the child.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parents receive notifications for each transaction and can view spending history or pause access to the feature through their own Google Pay app, the company said. The move could also help Google broaden Google Pay’s usage and addressable market in India, where it <a href=\"https://entrackr.com/news/phonepe-records-94-bn-upi-transactions-in-october-10785555\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">competes closely with Walmart-backed PhonePe</a> among the country’s leading UPI platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s Pocket Money feature follows earlier efforts by Indian fintechs such as FamPay and Junio, which sought to enable children’s digital spending through prepaid cards. However, unlike prepaid instruments, Google uses the UPI Circle framework to let parents retain control of funds until the moment a transaction is made, rather than loading money in advance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With UPI Circle, the money stays in the parent’s account until it is spent,” Bulusu said, adding that the approach makes it easier for families already comfortable using Google Pay to introduce children to digital payments. He said the feature reflects a broader bet on familiar payments apps as a way to build financial confidence among younger users as digital payments become more pervasive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also upgrading the experience for small businesses on Google Pay, allowing customers to rate merchants directly after a transaction, with those reviews syncing to the merchant’s Google Maps listing. The company is also rolling out an AI-powered advertising feature within the Google Pay for Business app that assists merchants in creating and launching ads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 530 million unique users have made at least one payment through Google Pay, while over 23 million small merchants have been onboarded to the platform over the years, Bulusu said. That reach, he added, gives the company confidence it can introduce new financial products to users already comfortable transacting digitally.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round was led by ChrysCapital and Dragon Funds, with participation from Schroders Capital and existing investors TR Capital and B Capital. Early backers, including Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Venture Partners, Z47, and Ventureast, sold shares in the secondary transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal valued MoEngage at “well over” $900 million post-money, per a person close to the deal, who added that the startup was tracking toward $100 million in annualized recurring revenue this year. MoEngage did not disclose these figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage plans to use the fresh capital to invest further in its Merlin AI suite and expand its use of AI agents to improve decision-making and efficiency for marketing teams, said Raviteja Dodda (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive, in an interview. The startup is also pushing deeper into product and engineering teams by bundling its analytics and transactional messaging tools into a broader offering, a move it expects to lift average contract values and expand its addressable market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you look at customer engagement, it is not necessarily focused on marketing teams. There are product and engineering teams, which also focus on how to make sense of customer behavior and data,” Dodda said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage also plans to use part of its fresh capital raise to pursue strategic acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, targeting software companies that complement its customer engagement platform or help accelerate its expansion in those markets. It also targets small AI teams to bolster its intelligence-led offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 11-year-old startup, which has its headquarters in Bengaluru and San Francisco, already gets more than 30% of its revenue from North America, about 25% from Europe and the Middle East, and the remaining 45% from India and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage’s secondary-heavy structure of the raise reflects its late-stage position, allowing early investors and employees to take liquidity without forcing the company into a near-term public listing. This approach gives MoEngage flexibility to choose its next steps based on business priorities rather than investor exit timelines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It gives us the opportunity not to have an urgency with regard to going IPO,” Dodda said, adding that the startup still aims to go public in a couple of years, depending on market conditions and other factors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage expects to turn earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) positive this quarter and is targeting compound annual growth of about 35% over the next three years, Dodda said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bhavin Turakhia, co-founder and chief executive of fintech firm Zeta, a MoEngage customer, said the startup’s analytics and messaging tools have helped it improve onboarding, activation, and cross-sell across key customer journeys.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The secondary component of the round also enabled some early investors to exit fully. Ventureast, which backed MoEngage in 2018, is one of them. The VC firm recorded a roughly 10-times return on its investment on a blended basis, its partner Vinay Rao told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rao said that while many global customer engagement companies operate with cost structures geared toward the U.S. market, MoEngage has retained an India-based cost structure, which he said has helped it compete more effectively in the U.S. while scaling the business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the latest round, MoEngage has raised about $307 million in primary funding to date. Avendus advised MoEngage for the transaction.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A key issue, apparently, was IPO timing. Anil pushed for an earlier listing than some directors wanted and signaled he might leave soon after, while board members sought more time to expand internationally and grow the company’s valuation. (Monzo was reportedly valued at $5.9 billion in an October 2024 secondary share sale backed by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and StepStone Group.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch sat down with Anil in person this summer, and we discussed the possibility of Monzo going public in 2026, a timeline that now appears to have been at the center of boardroom disagreements.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Future of Digital Finance l StrictlyVC London\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pqo3qyUg3jA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under Anil’s leadership since 2020, Monzo reportedly tripled its customer base to 13 million and posted record £60.5 million pre-tax profits. But nearly all customers remain U.K.-based after the company’s U.S. expansion stalled in 2021. We talked with Anil about this, too, during our sit-down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now Layfield, who spent nine years at Google and more than a decade at Standard Chartered (of which Anil is also an alum), will oversee Monzo’s international strategy and guide it toward its eventual public listing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve reached out to Monzo for more information.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An administrative law judge <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/california-judge-says-tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-autopilot-marketing-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has ruled</a> that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The judge agreed with <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/post/california-dmv-claims-tesla-misled-drivers-driving-capabilities-looks-suspend-business-30-days/17234677/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the state DMV’s request</a> to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to comply. Tesla will now have to either drop the Autopilot name or ship software to its cars that make them autonomous, or it will have those licenses suspended. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has signaled it won’t comply, though. Tesla said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/tesla_na/status/2001103872891486627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if that is the case, the “DMV’s authority to regulate vehicle advertising does not depend on evidence that any particular advertising actually has deceived or harmed any person,” the judge <a href=\"https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=361671590&amp;z=0992d8f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in her decision. The DMV is permitted to “act affirmatively to prevent deceptive advertising.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV did not respond to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision, though the judge addressed the company’s likely non-compliance in her decision. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Without the incentive of suspension, however, [Tesla] offers no reason for the DMV to expect that respondent will alter the Autopilot name, or will act to avoid continuing its misrepresentations to the public regarding its vehicles’ ADAS functions,” she wrote. “Suspension of respondent’s licenses is a reasonable remedy.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has faced multiple investigations from the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/tesla-under-investigation-by-california-attorney-general.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">California Attorney General</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Department of Justice</a>, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/tesla-starts-testing-robotaxis-in-austin-with-no-safety-driver/\">the company removed the safety monitors</a> from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to include information from the judge’s decision, the DMV’s press release</em>, <em>and Tesla’s response.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
