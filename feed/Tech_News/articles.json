Conduent said in October that 4 million people across the state were affected.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another 10.5 million people are affected across Oregon, per the state’s attorney general. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conduent has also notified hundreds of thousands of people across Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and other states, according to data breach notifications seen by TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stolen data includes individuals’ names, Social Security numbers, medical data and health insurance information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the largest government contractors today, Conduent handles and processes large amounts of personal and sensitive information on behalf of large corporations, government departments, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/govtech-giant-conduent-wont-rule-out-cyberattack-as-outage-drags-on/\">several U.S. states</a>. The company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.news.conduent.com/how-government-agencies-and-their-customers-can-navigate-change\">says</a> its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people in the United States across various government healthcare programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When contacted with several questions about the data breach, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins provided a boilerplate statement that did not address the questions, nor did they answer if Conduent knows how many individuals are affected by the cyberattack. The spokesperson would not say if the breach affects more than 100 million people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Collins said that the company has been working to “conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information” taken in the breach, but would not say how many data breach notifications the company has sent out to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Little else is known about the breach, and the company has disclosed few details. Conduent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001677703/000167770325000067/cndt-20250409.htm\">disclosed the cyberattack in April</a>, months after hackers knocked out the company’s systems, which resulted in outages to government services across the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Safeway ransomware gang <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/DarkWebInformer/status/1892667528725328283\">took credit</a> for the breach, claiming to have stolen over 8 terabytes of data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1677703/000167770325000152/cndt-20250930.htm\">a later SEC filing</a>, the company said that the stolen data sets “contained a significant number of individuals’ personal information associated with our clients’ end-users,” referring to its corporate and government customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conduent also said it is continuing to notify individuals whose data was stolen in the breach, and plans to conclude alerting individuals by early 2026. The company did not give a more specific timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the Conduent cyberattack?

By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don’t work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Called a Large Tabular Model (LTM) rather than a Large Language Model (LLM), Fundamental’s Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn’t rely on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/\">the transformer architecture</a> that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use-case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that’s within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Fraenkel sees it, that’s a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to Big Data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said that in October, an “unauthorized third party” accessed user data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other unspecified “internal metadata.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Substack specified that more sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, passwords, and other financial information, was unaffected.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an email sent to users, Substack chief executive Chris Best said that the company identified the issue in February that allowed someone to access its systems. Best said that the company has fixed the problem and started an investigation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address and phone number from your Substack account being shared without your permission,” said Best in the email to users. “I’m incredibly sorry this happened. We take our responsibility to protect your data and your privacy seriously, and we came up short here.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear what exactly the issue was with its systems, and the scope of the data that was accessed. It’s also not yet known why the company took five months to detect the breach, or if the company was contacted by hackers demanding a ransom. TechCrunch asked the company for more details, and we will update our story if we hear back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Substack did not say how many users are affected. The company said that it doesn’t have any evidence that users’ data is being misused, but did not say what technical means, such as logs, it has to detect evidence of abuse. However, the company asked users to take caution with emails and texts without any particular indicators or direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On its website, Substack says that its site has more than 50 million active subscriptions, including 5 million paid subscriptions — a milestone <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://post.substack.com/p/5-million\">it reached last March</a>.

The result, he argued, is a shift in how people interact with technology. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the years ahead, he said, “hopefully all our phones will go back in our pockets, and we can immerse ourselves in the real world around us, with voice as the mechanism that controls technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That vision fueled ElevenLabs’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/elevenlabs-raises-500m-from-sequioia-at-a-11-billion-valuation/\">$500 million raise</a> this week at an $11 billion valuation, and it is increasingly shared across the AI industry. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/openai-bets-big-on-audio-as-silicon-valley-declares-war-on-screens/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/googles-ai-mode-can-now-have-back-and-forth-voice-conversations/\">Google</a> have both made voice a central focus of their next-generation models, while Apple appears to be quietly building voice-adjacent, always-on technologies through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/apple-buys-israeli-startup-q-ai-as-the-ai-race-heats-up/\">acquisitions like Q.ai.</a> As AI spreads into wearables, cars, and other new hardware, control is becoming less about tapping screens and more about speaking, making voice a key battleground for the next phase of AI development. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Iconiq Capital general partner Seth Pierrepont echoed that view onstage at Web Summit, arguing that while screens will continue to matter for gaming and entertainment, traditional input methods like keyboards are starting to feel “outdated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And as AI systems become more agentic, Pierrepont said, the interaction itself will also change, with models gaining guardrails, integrations, and context needed to respond with less explicit prompting from users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staniszewski pointed to that agentic shift as one of the biggest changes underway. Rather than spelling out every instruction, he said future voice systems will increasingly rely on persistent memory and context built up over time, making interactions feel more natural and requiring less effort from users. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That evolution, he added, will influence how voice models are deployed. While high-quality audio models have largely lived in the cloud, Staniszewski said ElevenLabs is working toward a hybrid approach that blends cloud and on-device processing — a move aimed at supporting new hardware, including headphones and other wearables, where voice becomes a constant companion rather than a feature you decide when to engage with. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ElevenLabs is already partnering with Meta to bring its voice technology to products including Instagram and Horizon Worlds, the company’s virtual reality platform. Staniszewski said he would also be open to working with Meta on its Ray-Ban smart glasses as voice-driven interfaces expand into new form factors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as voice becomes more persistent and embedded in everyday hardware, it opens the door to serious concerns around privacy, surveillance, and how much personal data voice-based systems will store as they move closer to users’ daily lives — something <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/google-pays-68-million-to-settle-claims-its-voice-assistant-spied-on-users/\">companies like Google</a> have already been accused of abusing.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify has partnered with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bookshop.org\">Bookshop.org</a> on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities. Spotify then earns an affiliate fee on sales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop’s website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089631\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=720,360 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=900,450 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=800,400 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=668,334 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=708,354 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PageMatch.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February. The feature was initially spotted by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-page-match-3633793/\">Android Authority</a> last month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify’s new Page Match feature lets users scan a page from a physical or e-book using their phone camera. The tool analyzes the page content and directs users to the exact spot in the audiobook. It’s powered by a combination of Spotify’s in-house and third-party computer vision and image scanning technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When users want to switch to the audiobook, they can select the “Scan to Listen” button and click the “Scan to Read” button to return to the physical book, making it easy for users to pick up where they left off, whether they’re reading at home or switching to audio while on the go.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Page Match is currently available for most English-language titles, with plans for future expansion. There are now more than 500,000 titles on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the two years since Spotify first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/spotify-brings-audiobooks-to-u-s-users-with-a-catalog-of-300000-titles-to-start/\">introduced audiobooks</a>, the platform has experienced significant growth.

The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQRu7DdTTVA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Another commercial</a> features a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack. After offering his height, age, and weight, the bot serves him an ad for height-boosting insoles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Anthropic commercials are cleverly aimed at OpenAI’s users, after that company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/\">recent announcement </a>that ads will be coming to ChatGPT’s free tier. And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/anthropic-super-bowl-ad-mocks-chatgpt-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“mocks,”</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-super-bowl-openai-chatgpt-ads-claude-2026-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“skewers,”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/873685/anthropics-first-super-bowl-ad-dunks-on-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“dunks on”</a> OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They are funny enough that even Sam Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">admitted on X</a> that he laughed at them. But he clearly didn’t really find them funny. They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users. ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/chatgpts-user-growth-has-slowed-report-finds/\">is still the most popular chatbot by a large margin</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the OpenAI CEO insisted the ads were “dishonest” in implying that ChatGPT will twist a conversation to insert an ad (and possibly for an off-color product, to boot).”We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote in the social media post. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, OpenAI has promised ads will be separate, labeled, and will never influence a chat. But the company has also said it is planning on making them conversation-specific — which is the central allegation of Anthropic’s ads. As OpenAI explained on <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its blog,</a> “We plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman then went on to fling some equally questionable assertions at his rival. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,” he wrote. “We also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Claude has a free chat tier, too, with subscriptions at $0, $17, $100, and $200. ChatGPT’s tiers are $0, $8, $20, and $200. One could argue the subscription tiers are fairly equivalent.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman also alleged in his post that “Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI.” He argues it blocks usage of Claude Code from “companies they don’t like,” like OpenAI, and said Anthropic tells people what they can and can’t use AI for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">True, Anthropic’s whole marketing deal since day one has been <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-achieves-iso-42001-certification-for-responsible-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“responsible AI.”</a> The company was founded by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/26/the-openai-mafia-15-of-the-most-notable-startups-founded-by-alumni/\">two former OpenAI alums, after all</a>, who claimed they grew alarmed about AI safety when they worked there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, both chatbot companies have <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">usage policies</a>, AI guardrails, and <a href=\"https://openai.com/safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">talk about AI safety.</a> And while OpenAI allows ChatGPT to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotica-for-adult-users/\">be used for erotica</a> while Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">does not</a>, OpenAI, like Anthropic, has determined that <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some content should be blocked</a>, particularly in regards to mental health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet Altman took this Anthropic-tells-you-what-to-do argument to an extreme level when he accused Anthropic of being “authoritarian.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One authoritarian company won’t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using “authoritarian” in a rant over a cheeky Super Bowl ad is misplaced, at best. It’s particularly tactless when considering the current geopolitical environment in which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/02/03/iran-protests-deaths-crackdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">protesters around the world</a> have been killed by agents of their own government. While business rivals have been duking it out in ads since the beginning of time, clearly Anthropic hit a nerve.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How can I communicate better with my mom?\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBSam25u8O4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Q4, Snap’s revenue <a href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Snap-Inc-Q4-25-Earnings-Slides.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was $1.7 billion</a>, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month/\">launched back in 2022</a>. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter — dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/snap-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-below-estimates-ad-competition-hurts-2026-02-04/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters also reports</a> that the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/nation-world/snapchat-charge-users-storing-memories/507-73964864-5cb6-4dfb-b380-123b66626619\">charge users for Memories</a> storage — a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps — and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019. In anticipation of that event, Snap recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">announced the creation</a> of a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., that is focused solely on further developing the glasses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our long-term vision for augmented reality extends beyond the smartphone to a future when computing is more natural, contextual and seamlessly integrated into the real world,” said Spiegel. The CEO added that it was important to develop a “strong standalone brand” for Specs, as he said the hardware product could appeal “to a different audience segment” than the “core Snapchat audience.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, it sounds like the strategy behind Specs may not be entirely ironed out yet. Later in the conversation, Spiegel continued: “We’re so close to launch that the key here is really just, you know, nailing the launch and making sure that we deliver an extraordinary product. And then, you know, I think we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we want to capitalize [on] it moving forward.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But according to Kembara co-founder and general partner Yann de Vries, getting to €750 million in two years as a first fund in this environment “was not easy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kembara is managed by a specialist team within Mundi Ventures, with offices in Madrid, London, Barcelona, and Paris. Mundi Ventures founder Javier Santiso is now also a co-founder and GP of the Kembara fund, which has now disclosed the full list of its senior partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside de Vries and Santiso, climate tech VC Robert Trezona and deep tech VC Pierre Festal have also joined as general partners, as well as former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as senior strategic advisor. <em>(Pictured from left to right: Javier Santiso, Siraj Khaliq, Robert Trezona, Yann de Vries and Pierre Festal.)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their individual track records helped them raise funds from institutional backers waking up to the need for European growth capital that can turn its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/76-european-deep-tech-university-spinouts-reached-unicorn-or-centaur-status/\">many university spinouts</a> into sizable businesses with industrial synergies. But it also gave them a front-row seat into the broader growing pains of European climate and deep tech startups — especially de Vries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A seasoned venture capitalist who founded Redpoint eVentures Brazil and later became a partner at Atomico, de Vries had moved to the other side of the table to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/atomico-partner-joins-lilium/\">join German electric aircraft startup Lilium</a> — only for the company to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/electric-aircraft-startup-lilium-ceases-operations-1000-workers-laid-off/\">cease operations</a> in 2024 after raising more than $1 billion and going public via a SPAC. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In de Vries’ view, Lilium went bankrupt because it couldn’t find the growth capital it needed, but this “traumatizing experience” also had a silver lining. “I saw so many amazing teams in Europe that were going through the same journey,” he said. “[Europe] doesn’t have an innovation problem. It doesn’t have a startup problem. The problem it has is a scale-up problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kembara’s sweet spot will be Series B and C rounds, with plans to write initial checks from €15 million to €40 million into some 20 companies. But the fund’s size leaves room for follow-ons to help portfolio startups scale manufacturing and expand globally, and total investments could go up to €100 million per company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s more than the full size of many European funds, though this may be changing: deep tech VC firm Elaia and asset manager Lazard teamed up to form <a href=\"https://lazardelaiacapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LEC</a> (Lazard Elaia Capital), whose initial investments will range between €20 million and €60 million per company, while operator-led fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/22/plural-the-vc-led-by-founders-pulls-together-a-new-432m-fund-to-back-european-startups/\">Plural</a> is reportedly <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/plural-new-fund-1bn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raising a new fund of up to €1 billion</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the capital-intensive nature of most climate and deep tech growth-stage companies means that even large VC checks can only go so far. One lesson de Vries learned from Lilium is that raising only in equity is very hard, and even puts companies in a hard spot later on. This inspired Kembara to take a different approach to financing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Several of us have lived through this, and what we want to do now is to productize non-dilutive financing for these deep tech founders to help them de-risk their future financing and optimize the capital structure to minimize dilution. And we’re bringing in [limited partners] who […] not only want to invest in the fund, but also want to coinvest in those winners,” de Vries said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For these LPs, geopolitics also plays a role in wanting to provide growth capital and venture debt to European growth-stage startups. “There’s going to be a lot of support from sovereign wealth funds in Europe, from government, from corporations, to push and drive for building these European champions in deep tech out of Europe,” de Vries predicted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These geopolitical undertones are also reflected in Kembara’s sector focus, which includes dual use and defense tech to “protect European sovereignty,” according to a press release. However, de Vries pushed back against the idea that Kembara is simply replacing capital that later-stage European outfits could have raised abroad. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are lots of gems that are under the radar in Europe, that could be scaling into global champions, and that are not realizing their full potential.” He said DeepMind is a related example, “where they were missing this growth capital and sold too early.” (Google acquired the company for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/\">more than $500 million in 2014</a>, but it is now estimated to be worth billions.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keeping European companies European has gained urgency in many verticals that overlap with Kembara’s thesis, such as quantum computing, semiconductors, and space tech. But its goal is to foster global champions that cross borders. Coincidentally, Kembara means “to wander” in Malaysian (although the team holds “the humble path to excellence” as an older meaning).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the name, Kembara has Malaysian connections. Santiso is also the former CEO for Europe of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah; and doors could open as many countries examine their exposure to the U.S. “In the second close, we’re going to be looking for global investors, because we want to have global access to markets, but also global access to supply chain,” de Vries said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With former employees who went on to create dozens of startups, the fintech company has become one of the most prolific “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/why-europe-and-israels-unicorns-are-producing-the-next-generation-of-tech-founders/\">founder factories</a>” — and the money is following. The latest example: business identity verification startup Duna, which just raised a €30 million Series A to become the best-funded European member of the so-called “Stripe mafia.” The funding round was led by Alphabet’s growth fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/a-peek-at-how-things-work-today-inside-alphabets-7-billion-growth-stage-investing-arm-capitalg/\">CapitalG</a>, which has also backed Stripe since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/25/payments-provider-stripe-has-raised-another-150-at-a-9b-valuation/\">co-leading its Series D</a> in 2016.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based in Germany and the Netherlands, Duna was co-founded by Stripe alumni Duco van Lanschot and David Schreiber. With customers including <a href=\"https://duna.com/news/duna-conversations-plaid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Plaid</a>, the startup helps fintech companies onboard business customers more efficiently, reducing the typical churn associated with corporate ID checks and other fraud prevention measures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stripe is not a customer of Duna, van Lanschot said, but its executives were well placed to understand the opportunity that the startup is seizing, which is reflected in its cap table. The company’s angel investors include former Stripe executives David Singleton (CTO), Claire Hughes Johnson (COO) and Michael Cocoman (Global Chief Compliance Officer). Even Stripe rival Adyen got involved, with CRCO Mariëtte Swart and CFO Ethan Tandowsky joining as angels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their endorsements also validate van Lanschot’s hunch that these companies won’t compete with Duna, even though they could. “It requires such fine-grained controls that change on a company-by-company basis, that an Adyen or a Stripe isn’t going to spin out their business onboarding as a separate product where another enterprise customer can change all of the configurations,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If it’s still worth the effort for Duna, it’s because the startup is going after the long tail of enterprise clients that don’t have huge resources to dedicate to business onboarding. But it’s also because its vision doesn’t stop there: Duna’s ambition is to build a network that allows companies to reuse their verified identity information across multiple platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we want to build over time is a global trust infrastructure where we provide a digital passport for every business. So you can reuse your file from onboarding on [German spend management platform] Moss to onboard with Plaid, or you can reuse it to open up a bank account,” van Lanschot said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This goal resonated with Alex Nichols, the general partner who led CapitalG’s investment into the Series A. “I would say the common thing I look for in my investments are some sort of network effects, or more formal scale advantage,” he told TechCrunch. “I also love it when founders have an earned insight about a problem they may not know about otherwise, and this is a very good example of that,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Duna has competitors in the category known as KYB, or Know Your Business. This includes vendors such as Jumio and Veriff. But for Nichols, what sets Duna apart is its decision to generate its own data, rather than trying to aggregate existing data sources that are often lacking. “It’s the rare opportunity to rebuild something as foundational as a Visa and create an amazing business in the process.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Duna says it has already found a strong business case in helping customers onboard corporate users faster and cheaper. This also explains why existing investors are doubling down: Index Ventures, which led <a href=\"https://duna.com/news/duna-announces-10m-seed-round-led-by-index-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Duna’s €10.7 million seed round</a> in May 2025, participated in the Series A, as did Puzzle Ventures and Snowflake chairman Frank Slootman. But the startup’s bigger ambition won’t pay off until Duna reaches significant scale. So the company is looking for shortcuts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How so? Van Lanschot and the Duna team are identifying small clusters of companies that already overlap with each other — what they call “patches of networks.” These include manufacturing companies with shared customers, investment firms with overlapping LPs, or companies in the same small country. In these tight-knit groups, the ability to reuse verification becomes valuable immediately, even before Duna achieves full network effects.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The countries may be small, but the opportunity is big, van Lanschot said. “In the Netherlands alone — a tiny, tiny country — the four biggest banks employ 14,000 people in compliance, and half of them are working on businesses.” CapitalG later clarified that 13,000 people work on compliance across all Dutch banks. Either way, Duna won’t fully replace these jobs yet, but AI automation can save costs and generate revenue even before the network effects kick in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Duna eventually provides the rails for an identity network, there might be an even bigger opportunity in taking advantage of this position to enable one-click business onboarding. This would make it akin to Amazon’s one-click checkout — or closer to B2B, to Stripe Link. Once again with Duna, the Stripe connection is never really far.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated to correct the name and title of one of Duna’s angel investors, and to add a clarification on the number of people employed in compliance in the Netherlands.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Instead of responding to an analyst’s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That decision tells us something, though — Alphabet isn’t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies’ search partnership saw the search giant paying the iPhone maker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">$20 billion</a> to be the default search engine on Apple devices, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">filings</a> from the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against the search giant revealed. In turn, Google gained access to Apple’s massive customer base — the iPhone maker last quarter <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/29/apple-reveals-it-has-2-5-billion-active-devices-around-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> it has 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, to give you an idea of scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest Apple AI deal is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rumored to cost Apple roughly $1 billion per year</a>, but the payoff beyond that for Google isn’t as immediately obvious as it is with search. In Google Search, consumers see links to advertisers’ websites at the top of their search results. Ads in AI Mode, which could one day represent the future of Google’s search business, are still an “experiment” for now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/google-is-bringing-ads-to-ai-mode/\">announced</a> last May that it would bring ads to AI Mode, the chatbot-style interface for Google Search, but these tests see the ads’ placement below or integrated into the chatbot’s responses. Google is also trying out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/googles-ai-mode-gets-new-agentic-capabilities-to-help-book-event-tickets-and-beauty-appointments/\">agentic shopping</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-adds-ai-powered-shopping-features-for-discovery-and-easy-check-out/\">including Shop with AI Mode</a>, to guide consumers with product-related queries to a seamless checkout experience from the AI interface. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Google’s AI competitor Anthropic is taking aim at ad-supported AI with <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/anthropic-takes-aim-at-openais-chatgpt-in-super-bowl-ad-debut-e38d08bb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqc1PZNSJ8lc9dFddGDlVq0wcT5a0pBuydlkIbATMyrp6B9WP1OqhTKVcPie8tA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6983d32f&amp;gaa_sig=O2OoiPHPl5bz2EhQJdnea8J0YCB0cOi4ep7q9Bwk80flMOHbrFXkd8UBBkjD2zc8LZ11Fv1Dz6k-5Y2YAgZ-WA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its forthcoming Super Bowl ad,</a> which challenges the business model being adopted by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How this will all play out longer-term is still an open question — and for today, an unanswered one, apparently. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, the Apple Siri deal barely received any mention during Alphabet’s earnings call on Wednesday. Sundar Pichai only noted he was pleased that Apple’s “preferred cloud provider” and would be helping to develop “the next generation of Apple foundation models based on Gemini technology.” Google’s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler used the exact same wording when mentioning Apple, as well.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-ai-has-nearly-500-million-users/\">reported </a>nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/chatgpts-user-growth-has-slowed-report-finds/\">810 million MAUs</a> in late 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company’s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a “positive driver” for the company’s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google recently rolled out a more affordable plan, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/googles-ai-plus-plan-rolls-out-to-all-markets-including-the-u-s/\">the Google AI Plus</a>, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the call to investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini’s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet’s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/google-unveils-ironwood-a-new-ai-accelerator-chip/\">Ironwood</a>, to compete with Nvidia.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum.

If there are none, it will automatically take new snapshots of the articles in question. Should a linked web page go offline, the new feature will then redirect readers to the archived versions, so that there is no drop in service. The tool also archives a user’s own posts, helping to ensure their longevity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool is designed to keep a site’s visitors reading the best available version of a web page. Indeed, Automattic’s plug-in perpetually checks a web page’s links, and if an original link that had gone offline is resurrected, the plug-in will start redirecting the user to that original page again instead of the archived version.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://github.com/a8cteam51/internet-archive-wayback-machine-link-fixer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">write-up on Github</a> shows that the plug-in’s controls are relatively easy to maneuver and offer convenient customization.

The department will be run by a chief of police elected by the city’s commission, and is expected to hire eight officers, according to local news outlet <a href=\"https://www.valleycentral.com/news/local-news/starbase-takes-policing-into-its-own-hands-with-new-department/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Valley Central</a>. It could be up and running in a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is a lot of assets here with the operations of SpaceX,” Starbase city administrator Kent Myers told the outlet. “Those assets need to be protected, and so the police department will play a critical part in protecting those assets.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if Starbase has submitted its application to the TCOLE yet. The city and the TCOLE did not respond to requests for comment. Starbase reportedly hired security consulting firm Vision Quest Solutions to build out the department.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase is where SpaceX makes and tests its prototype Starship rocket. The city is small — it is currently home to just a few hundred residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees (or family of those workers). But it is geographically isolated. The closest neighboring town is Brownsville, which is about 10 miles away, though the drive can take 45 minutes or longer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A police department would be the latest addition to public services that have become available in Starbase since it was incorporated <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/04/residents-of-spacexs-starbase-launch-site-vote-to-incorporate-as-a-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as a city last year</a>. In October, a handful of SpaceX employees who live at Starbase <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/at-starbase-spacex-is-taking-firefighting-into-its-own-hands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">started a volunteer fire department</a>. The city also created a fire marshal position and took on its own building inspections and permitting around that same time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase initially tried to handle law enforcement within its city limits by contracting with the Cameron County sheriff’s office. The city <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/starbase-hires-cameron-county-to-police-its-streets-and-jail-its-offenders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">struck a $3.5 million, five-year contract</a> with the sheriff’s office that was supposed to see two deputies patrol the city at a time, with eight deputies overall assigned to the detail. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase also struck an agreement last year with the sheriff’s office to use the county’s jail. The company town agreed to pay $100 per day per inmate and to reimburse any additional expenses, like medical care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal apparently has not worked out, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We didn’t have a lot of success in finding deputies through the county, so we decided to change direction,” Myers told Valley Central. That was apparently due in part to the contract not having civil service protections, Sheriff Manuel Treviño told the outlet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The relatively new mobile app from the startup <a href=\"https://atmasciences.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Atma Sciences</a> lets anyone create experiences using text, photos, sound, and touch, which are then displayed in a vertical feed, similar to TikTok or Reels. But unlike traditional short-form video apps, you don’t just watch and scroll in Gizmo — you play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Depending on the type of “Gizmo” you encounter, you might poke the screen, swipe, tap, draw, drag, and more to interact with the mini app. These Gizmos aren’t just games but are more like digital toys — things that could include interactive puzzles, memes, art, animation, or anything else a creator can dream up.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089592\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg 2346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=680,363 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=1200,641 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=1280,684 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=430,230 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=720,385 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=900,481 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=800,428 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=1536,821 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=2048,1095 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=668,357 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=1154,617 1154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=708,378 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/gizmo-app-store.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Gizmo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is an engaging, playful feed, where you can like and comment on the tiny creations and even remix existing Gizmos to create your own version, if you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, you don’t need to know how to code or even vibe code to get started. Instead, you can simply type out an AI prompt to explain your idea using natural language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app then leverages AI coding technology to turn your idea into an interactive experience by generating the code that makes it work. As part of this process, Gizmo will also render your idea visually to ensure that each app functions properly and runs smoothly. Apps are also vetted using AI and human moderation to ensure user safety, a company <a href=\"https://gizmo.party/support/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FAQ</a> notes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gizmo hails from a New York-based startup called <a href=\"https://atmasciences.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Atma Sciences</a>, co-founded by Rudd Fawcett and Brandon Francis, along with CEO Josh Siegel and CTO Daniel Amitay. The company last year raised a $5.49 million seed round from First Round Capital and others, according to data from <a href=\"http://pitchbook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PitchBook</a>. On the company’s website (which is also silly and interactive), the team explains their focus is on combining “powerful technology with simple, elegant foundations,” starting with their creativity app, Gizmo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of the company’s founders responded to requests for an interview when TechCrunch reached out through multiple emails, requests to investors, and via LinkedIn. We were told by one investor that the team isn’t yet ready to do press. (Sorry!)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch was drawn to Gizmo because of the app’s potential for growth and its unique approach to the vibe-coding space (and a rare recommendation from my teen). The company is envisioning a world where anyone can create apps for fun, not just for a purpose, as with other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/the-rise-of-micro-apps-non-developers-are-writing-apps-instead-of-buying-them/\">vibe-coding app platforms for micro apps</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/vibe-coding-startup-anything-nabs-a-100m-valuation-after-hitting-2m-arr-in-its-first-two-weeks/\">like Anything</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite being relatively new, Gizmo’s feed isn’t repetitive. It’s filled with creative mini apps, leading to an experience that feels somewhat like a mash-up between TikTok and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/rooms-an-interactive-3d-space-designer-and-cozy-game-arrives-on-the-app-store/\">interactive 3D-space designer</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/google-puts-1m-into-3d-design-app-rooms-after-more-than-1-million-rooms-created/\">Rooms</a>. But while Rooms introduced the programming language Lua to those who wanted more advanced controls over their creations, Gizmo keeps things prompt-based and simple.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app is incredibly easy to use. You simply type out your prompt and then see how it turns out, and then modify as needed. In one test, the AI quickly coded a mini quiz, but we had to instruct it to edit the title, which was cut off at the top of the screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The resulting creation can be shared to the app’s feed, messaged to a friend, or posted to social media using a unique URL.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to data from market intelligence firm Appfigures, Gizmo has roughly 600,000 installs, with around half coming from the U.S., after being <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/atmasciences_meet-gizmo-a-new-way-to-make-playful-personal-activity-7363303961639964672-NB9U?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAABfl0AB-pFcSfrJ_NE6Dz-ocSptWS4YoW4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced</a> with little fanfare less than six months ago. Around 235,000 of its downloads came in December alone, representing 39% of its total count.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gizmo’s growth from October to December was 312%, with December installs up 50% month-over-month and November installs up 180% from October. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app is available on both <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmo-make-gizmos/id6740640581\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atmasciences.gizmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Android</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Amazon will begin a closed beta program in March, inviting industry partners to try out its AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon said it anticipates sharing initial outcomes from the program by May. The company chose not to provide further details on the developments when approached by TechCrunch for a comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Studio is collaborating with notable producers like Robert Stromberg, known for “Maleficent,” Kunal Nayyar from “The Big Bang Theory,” and former animator Colin Brady from Pixar to learn the best way to implement these tools. Amazon is also tapping Amazon Web Services for support and intends to work with several LLM providers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Albert Cheng, who heads the AI Studios initiative, emphasized that the goal is to support creative teams, not to replace them. The focus is on improving efficiency and reducing costs while ensuring that intellectual property is protected and AI-generated content isn’t absorbed into other AI models. One example used is Amazon’s “House of David” series, which featured <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/house-of-david-season-2-showrunner-pro-ai-shots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">350 AI-generated shots</a> in season two. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​However, the rise of adoption of AI in Hollywood has stirred up plenty of debate. Many people in the industry worry about what it means for jobs, creativity, and the future of filmmaking. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conversations around AI are only getting louder as more companies experiment with these new tools. For instance, Netflix has also jumped on the AI bandwagon, with co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealing that its series “The Eternaut” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/netflix-starts-using-genai-in-its-shows-and-films/\">used generative AI </a>to create a building collapse scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In recent years, Amazon has cited its success with AI as a factor in layoffs. The company recently eliminated <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/amazon-says-it-is-laying-off-16000-employees/\">16,000 jobs</a> in January, following <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/amazon-to-cut-14000-corporate-jobs/\">14,000 layoffs</a> last October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Match said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity, and trust. To do so, the company said it is redesigning discovery to make it less repetitive and is using other features, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/tinder-will-require-new-users-in-the-us-to-verify-their-identity-with-a-selfie/\">Face Check </a>— a facial recognition verification system — to cut down on bad actors. On Tinder, the latter led to a more than 50% reduction in interactions with bad actors, Match noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder’s decision to start moving away from the swipe toward more targeted, AI-powered recommendations could have a significant impact on the dating app. Today, the swipe method, which was popularized by Tinder, encourages users to think that they’re choosing a match from an endless number of profiles. But in reality, the app presents the illusion of choice, since matches have to be two-way to connect, and even then, a spark is not guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company delivered an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/match-group-mtch-q4-2025-earnings-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings beat</a> in the fourth quarter, with revenue of $878 million and EPS of 83 cents per share, above Wall Street estimates. But weak guidance saw the stock decline on Tuesday, before <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/tinder-parent-match-group-s-stock-rises-7-premarket-what-s-making-traders-swipe-right/ar-AA1VDihR?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rising again</a> in premarket trading on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond AI, Match will also increase its product marketing to help boost Tinder engagement. The company is committing to $50 million in Tinder marketing spend, which will include creator campaigns on TikTok and Instagram, where users will make claims that “Tinder is cool again,” Rascoff noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The six-year-old company, which builds battery packs for homeowners in California, Georgia, and Washington, said Wednesday it has completed two large funding rounds. The startup shared it raised a previously unannounced $130 million Series C and a $102 million Series D. The Series C was led by Activate Capital, while the Series D was led by B Capital and Prelude Ventures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup plans to use the funds to scale manufacturing to 20,000 units by the end of this year before ramping up to 100,000 by the end of 2028. In total, Lunar has raised more than $500 million from investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stationary storage has become a bright spot for battery manufacturers that have been subject to policy whiplash after the Trump administration and GOP-controlled Congress <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/final-gop-bill-kneecaps-renewables-and-hydrogen-but-lifts-nuclear-and-geothermal/\">gutted large parts of the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which had incentivized companies to build batteries in the U.S. to supply the automotive industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the grid strains under the weight of an increasingly electrified economy — along with the boom in data center demand — grid-connected batteries have become one of the most versatile ways to boost its resiliency. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lunar can call on its fleet of batteries, which come in 5 kilowatt-hour modules between 15 kilowatt-hours and 30 kilowatt-hours, to deliver juice to the grid when needed. Its virtual power plant (VPP) software can also control EV chargers and appliances, allowing it to both supply electrons while tamping down demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such VPPs are <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/turing-test-inspired-tool-compares-virtual-power-plants-to-gas-peakers/808162/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expected</a> to be able to replace costly and polluting peaking power plants in a matter of years.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Competition in the space has been heating up lately. In October, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/base-power-raises-1b-to-deploy-home-batteries-everywhere/\">Base Power raised $1 billion</a>, less than six months after raising a $200 million round for its residential battery-based VPP. Tesla operates its own Powerwall-based VPP, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of residential settings, Tesla’s storage business has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/teslas-energy-storage-business-is-growing-faster-than-any-other-part-of-the-company/\">growing in leaps and bounds</a>, while former Tesla executive JB Straubel’s startup Redwood Materials has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/redwood-materials-launches-energy-storage-business-and-its-first-target-is-ai-data-centers/\">launched its own energy storage division</a>. Even Ford <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/ford-is-starting-a-battery-storage-business-to-power-data-centers-and-the-grid/\">wants in on the action</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Batteries have transformed from bit players just five years ago to major assets on the grid. Their modularity makes them quick to build and easy to deploy, and while they’re still costly relative to some fossil fuel power sources, prices have been dropping quickly. No wonder investors are piling in.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
