But one U.S. senator wants to know if other tech giants, like Google, have also received secret backdoor demands from the U.K. government. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google refused to answer the lawmaker’s questions but has since told TechCrunch that the technology giant has not received a backdoor demand, marking the first time that Google has confirmed it is not subject to a similar U.K. order.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported that the U.K. Home Office <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\">sought a secret court order in the U.K.’s surveillance court</a> demanding that Apple allows U.K. authorities to access the end-to-end encrypted cloud data stored on any customer in the world, including their iPhone and iPad backups. Apple encrypts the data in such a way that only customers, and not Apple, can access their data stored on its servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under U.K. law, tech companies subject to secret surveillance court orders, such as Apple, are legally barred from revealing details of an order, or the existence of the order itself, despite <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\">details of the demand publicly leaking earlier this year</a>. Critics called the secret order against Apple “draconian,” saying it would have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/uks-secret-apple-icloud-backdoor-order-is-a-global-emergency-say-critics/\">global ramifications for users’ privacy</a>. Apple has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/apple-is-challenging-u-k-s-icloud-encryption-backdoor-order/\">since appealed the legality of the order</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26035106-wyden-dni-google-uk/\">a new letter</a> sent to top U.S. intelligence official Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that while tech companies cannot say whether they have received a U.K. order, at least one technology giant has confirmed that it hasn’t received one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta, which uses end-to-end encryption to protect user messages sent between WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, told Wyden’s office on March 17 that the company has “not received an order to backdoor our encrypted services, like that reported about Apple.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, for its part, would not tell Wyden’s office if it had received a U.K. government order for accessing encrypted data, such as Android backups, “only stating that if it had received a technical capabilities notice, it would be prohibited from disclosing that fact,” said Wyden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google spokesperson Karl Ryan told TechCrunch in a statement: “We have never built any mechanism or ‘backdoor’ to circumvent end-to-end encryption in our products. If we say a product is end-to-end encrypted, it is.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When explicitly asked by TechCrunch, Ryan said: “We haven’t received a technical capabilities notice,” referring to any U.K. surveillance order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wyden’s letter, first reported by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/29/uk-encryption-backdoor-wyden-letter-gabbard/\">The Washington Post</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26035106-wyden-dni-google-uk/\">shared with TechCrunch</a>, called on Gabbard to make public its “assessment of the national security risks posed by the U.K.’s surveillance laws and its reported secret demands of U.S. companies.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated with additional comment from Google, shared in response to a TechCrunch inquiry.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The potential power source works by compressing fuel until it turns into a dense plasma, so dense that atoms begin fusing, releasing energy in the process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s so much here. The best ideas have yet to come to unlock a lot of potential in the fusion space,” Duncan Turner, general partner at SOSV, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But fusion is just the tip of the iceberg, Turner said. The company has already invested in two companies, including YPlasma, which uses plasma actuators to cool data center chips and control airflow over wind turbine blades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finding new uses for plasma in semiconductor manufacturing, where the state of matter already plays a role, could unlock new materials and processes, Turner said. Spacecraft could benefit from plasma thrusters, which are more fuel efficient than traditional thrusters. Harnessing plasma could also unlock <a href=\"https://www.pcrg.unsw.edu.au/research/research-capabilities/plasma-catalysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">entirely new ways to make chemicals</a> like ammonia for fertilizer or fuel from CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of that combined, we were like, ‘Oh wow, there’s way more than 25 companies here,’” he said. “There’s actually hundreds of companies here.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-notebooklm-is-getting-video-overviews/\">introduced at Google I/O</a> in May, Video Overviews allow users to turn dense multimedia, such as raw notes, PDFs, and images, into digestible visual presentations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, the service took an audio approach to helping users understand materials with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/29/googles-notebooklm-expands-its-ai-podcast-feature-to-more-languages/\">Audio Overviews</a>, a feature that gives users the ability to generate a podcast with AI virtual hosts based on documents they have shared with NotebookLM, such as course readings or legal briefs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this new capability, NotebookLM is taking a more visual approach to helping users understand different topics and ideas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says users can think of Video Overviews as a visual alternative to Audio Overviews.

Studies have shown that using <a href=\"https://nssa.stanford.edu/news/study-ai-assisted-tutoring-boosts-students-math-skills#:~:text=In%20all%2C%20about%201%2C000%20students,didn't%20work%20with%20AI.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT can be a helpful tutor </a>for young people, but it also <a href=\"https://www.psypost.org/study-finds-chatgpt-eases-students-cognitive-load-but-at-the-expense-of-critical-thinking/#google_vignette\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">may harm their critical thinking skills.</a> A research paper released in June found that <a href=\"https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">people who use ChatGPT to write essays exhibit lower brain activity during the process</a> compared to those who use Google Search or nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When ChatGPT first launched in 2022, its widespread use in school settings sparked fear among educators, leading to generative AI bans in many American school districts. By 2023, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/business/schools-chatgpt-chatbot-bans.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some of those schools repealed their ChatGPT bans</a>, and teachers around the country came to terms with the fact that ChatGPT would be a part of young people’s lives from now on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now with the launch of Study Mode, OpenAI hopes to improve ChatGPT as a learning tool, and not just an answer engine. Anthropic launched a similar tool for its AI chatbot Claude, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/anthropic-launches-an-ai-chatbot-tier-for-colleges-and-universities/\">called Learning Mode</a>, in April.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, there are limitations to how effective Study Mode truly is. Students can easily switch into the regular mode of ChatGPT if they just want an answer to a question. OpenAI’s VP of Education, Leah Belsky, told TechCrunch in a briefing that the company is not offering tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. However, Belsky said OpenAI may explore administrative or parental controls in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means it will take a committed student to use Study Mode — the kids have to really want to learn, not just finish their assignment.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says Study Mode is the company’s first step to improving learning in ChatGPT and aims to publish more information in the future about how students use generative AI throughout their education.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify has experimented with various voice interfaces in the past, and more recently, added an AI DJ that introduces tunes the company thinks you’ll like and lets you make your own requests. Now, Spotify is teasing that generative AI advances may pave the way for an even more conversational interface with the streaming service in the future, according to comments made during Spotify’s second-quarter earnings call with investors on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked about how AI was affecting its business, Spotify Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström noted that consumers today are able to talk to Spotify in plain English to request music, allowing the company to associate which phrases connect with which songs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can think of it as us getting a new dataset,” he said. “Spotify’s got this unique dataset from all of its playlists, which was really song-to-song — like which song goes well with another song, kind of the Amazon ‘people who bought this also bought that,’” he said. Meanwhile, the voice interface is delivering new insights to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And that’s completely new to us, and it’s a very, very valuable dataset that we are collecting very quickly,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, the exec says we can expect Spotify’s consumer experiences to get “much more interactive.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can already write to Spotify, talk to Spotify. You’re just going to see that expand,” Söderström said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, AI technology would allow Spotify to do more than just predict what someone might want to listen to, whether music, podcasts, or audiobooks, as it does today. Instead of only making predictions, it would be able to “reason” over the user’s listening history and what they said to the AI DJ. The reference to reasoning suggests that Spotify is looking toward AI reasoning models that can perform more complex tasks across multiple steps.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The voice data in question comes from Spotify’s AI DJ feature. In May 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/spotifys-ai-dj-now-lets-you-use-voice-commands-to-personalize-your-tunes/\">Spotify introduced a way</a> for Premium subscribers to make voice requests to the English-language AI DJ by pressing a button in the app. This lets users change the music, the genre, or the mood of a playlist using a voice command.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consumer features aren’t the only way Spotify is leveraging AI. During the call, the exec also mentioned that Spotify is using generative AI internally to more rapidly prototype products and create efficiencies in other areas of its business, like finance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the quarter, Spotify <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-q2-2025-earnings-subscribers-profit-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hit 276 million paying subscribers</a>, up 12% year-over-year, and 696 million monthly active users, but swung to a loss after missing revenue targets. The stock <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/spotify-spot-stock-q2-2025-earnings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fell 10% on weak guidance</a> and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s comments about his unhappiness with the company’s ads business.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company says it will use a variety of signals to determine the users’ possible age, regardless of what the user entered as their birthday when they signed up for an account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When YouTube identifies a user as a teen, it <span>intr</span>oduces new protections and experiences, which include disabling personalized advertising, safeguards that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/youtubes-new-teen-safeguards-limit-repeated-viewing-of-some-video-topics-and-more/\">limit repetitive viewing</a> of certain types of content, and enabling <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/48055830/bedtime-reminders-other-features-to-help-you-manage-screen-time?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">digital well-being tools</a> such as screen time and bedtime reminders, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These protections already exist on YouTube, but have only been applied to those who verified themselves as teens, not those who may have withheld their real age. For instance, in 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/youtubes-new-teen-safeguards-limit-repeated-viewing-of-some-video-topics-and-more/\">YouTube began limiting repeated viewing of videos</a> that could trigger body image issues or those that display social aggression. The company has also been developing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/\">digital well-being tools since 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the new system incorrectly identifies a user as under 18 when they are not, YouTube says the user will be given the option to verify their age with a credit card, government ID, or selfie. Only users who have been directly verified through this method or whose age has been inferred to be over 18 will be able to view the age-restricted content on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The machine learning-powered technology will begin to roll out over the next few weeks to a small set of U.S. users and will then be monitored before rolling out more widely, the company says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plans to introduce age inference technology were <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-big-bets-for-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced in February</a> as part of YouTube’s 2025 roadmap. The plans are also the latest step in attempting to make YouTube safer for younger users, following the <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-kids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2015 launch of the YouTube Kids app</a> and the <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/a-collaborative-approach-to-teen-supervision-on-youtube/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2024 rollout of supervised accounts</a>. The features also arrive as social media more broadly is coming under increased government scrutiny in the United States, where platform makers, including Apple and Google, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-25/meta-clashes-with-apple-google-over-child-age-check-legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have pitted their lobbyists against those from big tech companies</a> like Meta over who’s responsible for age verification and children’s safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, a handful of U.S. states have taken matters into their own hands, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_age_verification_laws_in_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over a dozen</a> states have passed or proposed laws to regulate minors’ use of social media. Many of these require age verification or parental consent, including those in Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Utah, Texas, Maryland, Tennessee, and Connecticut, among others. (However, some laws, like those in Utah and Arkansas, are blocked by litigation at this time and are not enforceable, while others are still pending implementation.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.K. also began enforcing its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/u-k-starts-enforcing-online-age-check-rules/\">own age-verification checks</a> this week following the 2023 passing of the Online Safety Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube isn’t sharing specifics about the signals it’s using to infer a user’s age, but notes that it will look at some data like the YouTube activity and the longevity of a user’s account to make a determination if the user is under 18. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new system will apply only to signed-in users, as signed-out users already cannot access age-restricted content, and will be available across platforms, including web, mobile, and connected TV.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunnel-digging company, and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee have <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/governor/news/2025/7/28/gov--lee--the-boring-company-unveil-transformative-underground-music-city-loop-project.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> a plan to build a 10-mile “loop” that will connect Nashville’s downtown and its convention center to the area’s airport. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The project will be privately funded by The Boring Company “and its private partners,” according to the Governor’s press release, though those partners are not named. The Boring Company and local officials will now begin a “public process to evaluate potential routes, engage community stakeholders, and finalize plans for the project’s initial 10-mile phase.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Construction won’t begin until the project clears the approvals process. But the governor’s office said the first segment of the loop could be operational as “early as fall of 2026.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that happens, Nashville would become the second city where The Boring Company has opened such a system, with the first being Las Vegas. The company has spent the last few years in Sin City digging and opening tunnels around the Las Vegas Convention Center, and claims to have given 3 million rides in Teslas to date.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk launched The Boring Company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/elon-musk-doesnt-just-want-to-bore-tunnels-he-wants-to-make-boring-better/\">in early 2017</a> (after publicly noodling about the idea on Twitter while stuck in traffic in late 2016), and it has taken many forms since then. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The original video detailing Musk’s idea — now set to private on YouTube — showed vehicles getting removed from surface street gridlock by an elevator-meets-sled system and lowered into a three-dimensional underground network of tunnels. Musk also claimed during the first Trump administration that The Boring Company had received “verbal govt approval” to dig tunnels from New York City to Washington, D.C. that, leveraging hyperloop technology, could make the trip in just 29 minutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of that ever happened. The Boring Company abandoned plans to dig a major tunnel system underneath <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737488/boring-company-los-angeles-map-tunnels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the greater Los Angeles area</a> after pushback from locals. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236075/elon-musk-chicago-boring-company-tunnel-politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">similar thing happened in Chicago</a>. And the Boring Company has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-boring-company-tunnel-traffic-11669658396?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhfvMIXMbeiC55gLg73wrgyCcOXRL3f0FVR-EWU-4pIfdr3q13zGHUhfzekY18%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6888d934&amp;gaa_sig=IRGHAhqL20ytOkZQLuePilNsoc3Mmmp0_wCVJQnQCrjXXoJX3YrzYPV_ecIYHGxqogF5Tbp9UkA7h5anONPIWw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">essentially ghosted many other cities around the country</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea of the hyperloop, which Musk admitted to biographer Ashlee Vance came from his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/22/hyperloop-one-elon-musk-high-speed-rail/\">hatred of California’s high-speed rail system</a>, was also cast aside. Even the Teslas that traverse the Las Vegas tunnels are being driven by humans, despite Musk’s obsession with self-driving cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, The Boring Company now more closely resembles a glorified convention center people-mover, although there are some potential benefits to its approach versus the typical monorail setup. Construction should be less disruptive to Nashville’s daily traffic. And, in its current form at least, it’s not costing taxpayers money.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Tennessee governor’s office cites The Boring Company’s safety record in Las Vegas in the announcement — the loop “recently earned a 99.57% safety and security rating” from the Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration, according to the press release — it is careful not to mention the trouble that Musk’s tunnel-digging effort has experienced during construction. (The governor’s office could not be reached for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/spacex-worker-injury-rates-at-starbase-outpace-industry-rivals/\">other Musk companies</a>, the pace at which The Boring Company operates — the same speed that the Tennessee governor’s office praised in its announcement — has been a concern for some of its workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Fortune’s Jessica Mathews <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that a Boring Company employee told his then-safety manager: “I have watched my friends get injured due to the fast pace we’ve been running… I refuse to be the first fatality in this company’s history. No tunnel is worth a single person’s life.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That same safety manager even spoke to Fortune on the record, saying: “The conditions they were told to work in were honestly almost unbearable … I couldn’t fix any of the things that were wrong.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Dorsey says he coded the basis of the app over the course of a weekend in early July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bitchat operates through Bluetooth mesh networks, which means that users can send messages to others within the range of Bluetooth connectivity — usually around 100 meters — without cell reception or a Wi-Fi connection. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app’s UX is very minimal. There is no log-in system, and you’re immediately brought to an instant messaging box, where you can see what nearby users are saying (if anyone is actually around you and using the app) and set your display name, which can be changed at any time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bitchat is sparking interest due to Dorsey’s reputation, the concept of Bluetooth-powered messaging apps is not new. These apps are also popular in settings like large music festivals, where cell service may be limited, or in the aftermath of natural disasters, where cell service and Wi-Fi availability may be impacted. The Bluetooth messaging app <a href=\"https://bridgefy.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bridgefy</a> was notably used during pro-democracy <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49565587\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">protests</a> in Hong Kong, since its ability to function without the internet made it harder for authorities to detect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey advertised Bitchat as a secure, private messaging platform when it went live for beta use earlier this month. But security researcher Alex Radocea <a href=\"https://www.supernetworks.org/pages/blog/agentic-insecurity-vibes-on-bitchat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pointed out in a blog post</a> that it’s easy to impersonate other people within Bitchat, calling into question how secure the “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/vibe-coding/\">vibe-coded</a>” app really is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In cryptography, details matter,” Radocea wrote. “A protocol that has the right vibes can have fundamental substance flaws that compromise everything it claims to protect.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey later admitted that the software had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/jack-dorsey-says-his-secure-new-bitchat-app-has-not-been-tested-for-security/\">not been subject to an external security review</a> and thus may contain vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bitchat’s concerns around impersonation also extend to the app itself. As of now, the app can be downloaded for iOS via the App Store, or it can be loaded onto an Android device by <a href=\"https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat-android/releases/tag/0.8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">downloading the app from GitHub</a>. However, the Google Play store hosts multiple apps that appear to be pretending to be Dorsey’s app, which have garnered thousands of downloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey has not directly addressed the fake Bitchat apps on the Google Play store, but he did repost <a href=\"https://x.com/callebtc/status/1949950406995374379\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">another user’s X post</a> that said that Bitchat is not yet on Google Play, and to “beware of fakes.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If the deal goes through, it would clear a key hurdle in OpenAI’s transition toward becoming a fully commercial enterprise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies have been negotiating regularly, and they could come to an agreement in a few weeks, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/microsoft-s-access-to-openai-tech-is-focus-of-contract-talks?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reports</a>, citing three anonymous sources. The report cited some of the sources as saying that while the talks have been positive, other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/ex-openai-staff-file-amicus-brief-opposing-the-companys-for-profit-transition/\">roadblocks</a> could emerge in the form of regulatory scrutiny and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/09/musk-may-still-have-a-chance-to-thwart-openais-for-profit-conversion/\">Elon Musk’s lawsuit</a> to block OpenAI’s for-profit transition. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/openai-reverses-course-says-its-nonprofit-will-remain-in-control-of-its-business-operations/\">currently structured</a> as a mission-driven nonprofit that oversees a capped for-profit company — a setup that’s meant to limit how fully it can commercialize or raise money. That structure hasn’t stopped it from raising billions and operating like a traditional tech company, but OpenAI still wants to shake off its constraints. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest backer with $13.75 billion invested and rights to some of the ChatGPT maker’s IP, has put up meaningful roadblocks to OpenAI’s future as a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/openai-may-pay-its-nonprofit-arm-billions-of-dollars-in-conversion-to-for-profit/\">for-profit company</a>, with talks dragging on for months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft wants a bigger stake in the restructured company and seeks to secure its access to OpenAI’s tech beyond the current deal, which ends in 2030 or whenever OpenAI says it has achieved AGI — though no one can really agree on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/even-the-godmother-of-ai-has-no-idea-what-agi-is/\">what that means</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft has built its Azure OpenAI Service around the smaller company’s models, and has integrated the startup’s tech into Copilot across Windows, Office, and GitHub. If OpenAI suddenly declares it has achieved AGI and cuts off access, Microsoft would lose a huge strategic advantage. The ChatGPT maker has reportedly also told its investors that it expects to pay Microsoft <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/openai-expects-to-cut-share-of-revenue-it-pays-microsoft-by-2030/\">a lower share of its revenue</a> as it progresses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A source told Bloomberg that OpenAI also hopes to guarantee that Microsoft deploys OpenAI’s technology safely, especially as it nears AGI. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft also stands to gain from OpenAI becoming a for-profit company. The current setup caps investor returns, so a more standard structure would give Microsoft a chance to receive formal equity and significant returns, in addition to access to OpenAI’s tech. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg reports that the two companies have been negotiating an equity stake for Microsoft in the low- to mid-30% range.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

Many manufacturers opt for skim milk to cut costs, which allows them to add oils to meet nutritional requirements. Several formulas contain palm oil, soy, and corn syrup, which aren’t recommended for infants due to their potential health risks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35998087/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">research</a> has linked corn syrup to an increased risk of obesity, while palm oil has been shown to <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/111/5/1017/63328/Reduced-Bone-Mineralization-in-Infants-Fed-Palm?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">decrease calcium and fat absorption</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I became fixated by the fact that there wasn’t a good, organic infant formula that I trusted, that I wanted to feed my daughter in the United States, which is a first-world country,” Hallam told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the past seven years, Hallam has been developing her own organic, whole-milk infant formula from scratch, with the help of scientists and pediatric nutritionists. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today marks the official launch of <a href=\"http://nara.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nara Organics</a>, which meets both European and U.S. safety standards, and is FDA-registered and USDA-certified. Most importantly, the formula is free from palm oil, soy, corn syrup, maltodextrin, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), providing a clean option for conscientious parents looking to nourish their babies with the best possible ingredients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nara Organics claims to have the highest percentage of milk fat of any formula sold in the U.S. It also has the lowest percentage of plant-based oils, as the use of whole milk means that less oil is needed to achieve the correct fat content. The ingredient list on the package includes an “organic vegetable oil blend” made up of organic sunflower, coconut, and rapeseed oils, which provide essential fatty acids that support healthy development.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031686\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nara Organics</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there are several brands with organic formulas, such as Bobbie and ByHeart, these products are manufactured in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In contrast, Nara Organics chose not to produce its formula in American facilities, potentially due to previous issues with Cronobacter contamination, a germ that can survive in dry foods. In recent years, there have been <a href=\"https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2023/03/20/voluntary-recall-certain-gerber-good-start-soothepro-powdered-infant-formula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">several </a>recalls of<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cronobacter/outbreaks/source-date/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> baby formula </a>linked to outbreaks of Cronobacter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is why the company prefers to manufacture its formula in Germany, which just so happens to be the birthplace of powdered infant formula. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chief marketing officer Meika Hollender explained to TechCrunch that the company’s manufacturing partner utilizes technology “that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A critical piece of infant formula, in terms of its shelf life, is how much oxygen gets into the can while you’re sealing it. So if you go to facilities in the U.S., they’re open. When you’re filling, canning, and sealing the can, they’re just sort of out in the open air of the facility. And at our facility, the cans actually go into this chamber that has no oxygen in them,” Hollender said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nara has secured a total of $32 million from AlleyCorp, BBG Ventures, Corazon Ventures, Gingerbread Capital, and Torch Capital. Additionally, the company has attracted attention from high-profile celebrity investors, including tennis superstar Serena Williams, “Jane the Virgin” actress Gina Rodriguez, and the creators of “Nobody Wants This,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/foster-sisters-explain-why-they-havent-invested-in-ai/\">Erin and Sara Foster</a>, among others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nicky Hilton, fashion designer and philanthropist, is also an investor and advisor.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I breastfed all of my three children, but they also all had formula,” Hilton told us. “Every baby and parent is different, and not all mothers are able to breastfeed due to medical, physical, or personal reasons. I think there’s so much judgment and unnecessary pressure about breastfeeding… It’s really exciting to be a part of an innovative brand that is disrupting the baby formula market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this support, Nara Organics could position itself as a key player in the organic formula market, which was valued at approximately <a href=\"https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/organic-infant-formula-market-2807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$20.7 billion</a> in 2023 and is expected to reach $37 billion by 2032.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031687\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nara Organics</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The formula is now available for purchase on the company’s website.

Instead, smaller companies may be thwarted by a multi-layered, expensive bureaucratic process used to ensure a company can meet security and other compliance requirements. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, Golden Dome may not be the zero-sum battle of emerging tech versus incumbents. The startups that do breakthrough will be those that are able to convince the biggest defense contractors to take them on as subcontractors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency released last week <a href=\"https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/f250fd59d7914ea19277e6fd9606c4ad/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a draft solicitation</a> for a $151 billion, multi-award contract, the prelude to the government’s forthcoming defense tech buying spree.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 10-year contract, called SHIELD, or Scalable Homeland Innovative Enterprise Layered Defense, acts as an umbrella that will be used to buy technology for the Golden Dome system. That program, which the White House likened to Israel’s Iron Dome, will encompass systems that span space, land, and sea to protect the continental United States against a variety of missile threats. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In order to build out this system, the government will be looking to purchase a range of cutting-edge technology, like space-based interceptors, ground-based radars, and terrestrial and sea-based systems capable of taking out an enemy missile in flight. The first hurdle for companies hoping to win one of the contracts is to qualify for the umbrella program, or vehicle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Getting onto the $151 billion vehicle doesn’t guarantee federal dollars; instead, companies will compete for contracting work on individual task orders. The final request for proposals will be released sometime in the fourth quarter of this year, though<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/musks-spacex-is-frontrunner-build-trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield-2025-04-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> that hasn’t stopped companies from already starting their lobbying efforts.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bryce Dabbs, CEO of consulting firm Approach Venture, told TechCrunch that he estimates between 5% and 10% of the pot could realistically go to non-traditional vendors — not by startups competing as a prime contractor, but rather through “teaming and subcontracting arrangements,” he said, noting that not all startups are equal. For instance, SpaceX and Anduril, while backed by venture capital, are already at the scale of small primes, and the opportunity for smaller startups will likely look considerably different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A startup with a compelling technology would need to collaborate with a defense prime, like Northrop Grumman or Lockheed, to provide a capability that the prime doesn’t currently offer in-house.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s because many early-stage companies lack facility clearances, personnel, IT security, or other requirements to perform highly classified government work — and the pre-solicitation warned that these barriers to entry will be in place for would-be suppliers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venture-backed companies like Anduril and SpaceX will be able to meet these security and compliance requirements, but everyone else will likely need to sub under a prime in order to compete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dabbs said his firm is seeing more early-stage founders reference Golden Dome in their decks, and that the program is frequently referenced when VCs do diligence on startups Approach supports. But the investors “may not fully understand how government procurement or larger contracts work,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, more mature and cash-rich startups like SpaceX and Anduril are better poised to compete with the legacy defense contractors, such as RTX (formerly Raytheon), Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and L3Harris. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/musks-spacex-is-frontrunner-build-trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield-2025-04-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters reported</a> earlier this year that a team composed of SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril has already started meeting with federal officials. Lockheed, meanwhile, launched a “Golden Dome for America” page on its website highlighting how it might contribute to the effort.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-far-not-fair\"><strong>FAR, not fair</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">William Greenwalt, senior fellow at American Enterprise Institute and former deputy undersecretary of defense industrial policy at the DOD, was less optimistic. “I am not overwhelmed by the prospects for non-traditionals to gain anything at all from this,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s because of the structure of the contract, which is being run under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While FAR requires “full and open competition,” the pathway’s high compliance standards implicitly keep newcomers out. Instead, Greenwalt said the program should be done as an Other Transaction Authority (OTA), which gives the DOD more flexibility to work with non-traditional vendors and fund prototypes with follow-on production opportunities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A CICA IDIQ contract is about the dumbest way to do this if you want innovation, as it will preclude non-traditionals from bidding. This should be done as an OTA — plain and simple,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump appointed General Michael Guetlein, second in command of the U.S. Space Force, to spearhead the initiative. He will be in charge of finalizing the program’s final architecture, which the White House wants to be in place in just three short years. That timeline favors technologies that are ready to be deployed now, not still being worked out in R&amp;D labs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Golden Dome is a bold and aggressive approach to hurry up and protect the homeland from our adversaries,” he said in May.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said today that it is rolling out an image-upscaling feature, an object blending, and an upgraded object remover to Photoshop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that the Generative Upscale feature will enhance an image up to 8 megapixels. This is useful for restoring details to old photos, upscaling images for prints, or adopting assets for various platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, Adobe teased a feature called <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/max/2024/sessions/project-perfect-blend-gs3-7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Project Perfect Blend</a>, which works on correcting colors, shadows, and lighting for new objects being added to an existing image. The idea is to have the new object, such as a sofa chair in a room, blend in with the environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now Adobe is rolling out this feature under the Harmonize moniker, letting you place an object in a scene, remove its background, and have Photoshop use Firefly models to adjust color, lighting, shadows, and visual tones to fit the object in the scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also rolling out an improved object-removal tool. Previously, when you used generative fill to remove the object, the tool considered the whole scene to fill in the gap of the removed object and at times, that resulted in unwanted artifacts in the image. The company has reworked the algorithm to have it focus on just removing the object and filling the gap with the background.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a demo seen by TechCrunch, when Adobe’s director for product management at Photoshop, Joel Baer, used an earlier version of object removal to remove a small bowl of pico de gallo from a picture, the tool just added a green blob. The new version was able to successfully remove the object and replace it with the background.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe is also adding a few small features to Photoshop, including a better way to manage putting assets in a shared and organized space. Plus, the company lets you choose the version of the Firefly model you want to choose while using AI features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have talked to photographers, designers, and content creators to understand what are the pain points in their workflows and what slows them down. These new features will help them save time, remove friction from their workflows, and take on some of the time-consuming tasks on their behalf,” Shambhavi Kadam, senior director of product management for Photoshop, said in a briefing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Generative Upscale, Harmonize, and improved object-removal features are available in beta for Photoshop on desktop and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/28/adobe-launches-photoshops-web-version-with-firefly-powered-ai-tools/\">web</a> versions. The Harmonize feature is also available on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/25/adobe-launches-a-photoshop-iphone-app/\">the new Photoshop iOS app</a> through an early access program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
