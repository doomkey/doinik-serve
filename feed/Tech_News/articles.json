You can choose which websites and apps to block for a specific period of time. So if you’re working on your laptop and then try to open TikTok on your phone, you won’t be able to — you’ll instead see a green screen indicating the app is blocked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app lets you start a session right away, schedule an upcoming one, or set a recurring one. If you know you need to be free of distractions at a certain time every day, you can set up a Freedom session to start at that specific time automatically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If your task doesn’t require internet access, you can block the internet altogether. You can also block all websites except the ones you need for work. If you really don’t trust yourself to get your work done, you can use the app’s “Locked Mode,” which prevents you from ending a Freedom session early. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pricing starts at $3.33 per month when billed annually or $8.99 per month when billed monthly, with a $199 lifetime subscription option. Freedom offers a seven-day free trial. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cold-turkey\">Cold Turkey</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077778\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png 2138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=1200,695 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=1280,741 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=430,249 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=720,417 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=900,521 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=800,463 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=1536,889 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=2048,1186 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=668,387 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=648,375 648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=1066,617 1066w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=708,410 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cold-turkey.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Cold Turkey</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://getcoldturkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cold Turkey</a> is a good option for people need strict accountability.

The extension lets you select which sites you want to block, then prevents your browser from loading them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can create multiple block sets with different sites, schedules, and limits. The extension lets you set blocks during specific times of the day or trigger one-off blocks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you don’t want to block a site outright, you can set a countdown delay before the page loads. For example, you can set it so that visiting a site starts a 10‑minute timer. You can still access the site once the countdown ends, but the delay can be enough to disrupt impulsive browsing habits. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that since LeechBlock is a browser extension, you need to have a bit of willpower to avoid simply switching browsers to do things watch Netflix or browse X.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-forest\">Forest</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077784\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg 7452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=2048,1154 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=1095,617 1095w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/forest.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Forest</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.forestapp.cc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Forest</a> gamifies productivity while supporting real-world environmental efforts.

Data Center Watch, an organization tracking anti-data center activism, <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">writes that</a> there are currently 142 different activist groups across 24 states that are organizing against data center developments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activists have a variety of concerns: the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/\">environmental</a> and potential <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/data-center-boom-risks-health-of-already-vulnerable-communities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">health impacts</a> of these projects, the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91444129/data-centers-surge-ai-boom-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">controversial ways</a> in which AI is being used, and, most importantly, the fact that so many new additions to America’s power grid may be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\">driving up local electricity bills</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such a sudden populist uprising appears to be a natural response to an industry that has grown so quickly that it’s now showing up in people’s backyards. Indeed, as the AI industry has swelled to dizzying heights, so, too, has the cloud computing business. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/look-forward/data-center-frontiers/data-center-risk-if-ai-promises-fade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shows that</a>, since 2021, construction spending on data centers has skyrocketed a stunning 331%. Spending on these projects totals in the hundreds of billions of dollars. So many new data centers have been proposed in recent months that many experts believe that a majority of them will not — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/a-fraction-of-proposed-data-centers-will-get-built-utilities-are-wising-up/748214/\">and, indeed, could not possibly</a> — be built.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This buildout shows no signs of slowing down in the meantime. Major tech giants — including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/31/tech-ai-google-meta-amazon-microsoft-spend.html#:~:text=As%20big%20as%20the%20spending,Inside%20India\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">all announced</a> significant capital expenditure projections for the new year, a majority of which will likely go toward such projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New AI infrastructure isn’t just being pushed by Silicon Valley but by Washington, D.C., where the Trump administration has made artificial intelligence a central plank of its agenda. The Stargate Project, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">announced</a> in January, set the stage for 2025’s massive AI infrastructure buildout by <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">heralding a supposed</a> “re-industrialization of the United States.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the process of scaling itself exponentially, an industry that once had little public exposure has suddenly been thrust into the limelight — and is now suffering backlash. Danny Cendejas, an activist with the nonprofit MediaJustice, has been personally involved in a number of actions against data centers, including a protest that took place in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year, where locals came out to decry the <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/how-mediajustice-is-leading-communities-to-push-back-against-ai-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expansion of Colossus</a>, a project from Elon Musk’s startup, xAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cendejas told TechCrunch that he meets new people every week who express interest in organizing against a data center in their community. “I don’t think this is going to stop anytime soon,” he said. “I think it’s going to keep building, and we’re going to see more wins — more projects are going to be stopped.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Evidence in support of Cendejas’ assessment is everywhere you look. Across the country, communities have reacted to newly announced server farms in much the same way the average person might react to the presence of a highly contagious plague. In Michigan, for instance, where developers are currently <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/12/at-least-16-sites-eyed-for-data-centers-in-michigan-amid-ai-boom-heres-where.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eyeing 16 different locations</a> for potential data center construction, protesters recently descended upon the state’s capitol, <a href=\"https://www.wilx.com/2025/12/16/data-center-protest-outside-michigan-capitol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">saying things like</a>: “Michiganders do not want data centers in our yards, in our communities.” Meanwhile, in Wisconsin — another development hot spot — angry locals appear to have recently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/25/microsoft-ai-data-center-rejection-vs-support.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dissuaded Microsoft</a> from using their town as a headquarters for a new 244-acre data center. In Southern California, the tiny city of Imperial Valley recently <a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/environment/2025/12/12/imperial-valley-city-sues-to-force-environmental-review-of-massive-data-center-project\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a lawsuit</a> to overturn its county’s approval of a data center project, expressing environmental concerns as the rationale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The discontent surrounding these projects has gotten so intense that politicians believe it could make or break particular candidates at the ballot box. In November, it was reported that rising electricity costs — which many believe are being driven by the AI boom — could become <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2026-election-utility-bills-ai-data-centers-13703f61d1397612fd067e69b9093116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a critical issue</a> that determines the 2026 midterm elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The whole connection to everybody’s energy bills going up — I think that’s what’s really made this an issue that is so stark for people,” Cendejas told TechCrunch. “So many of us are struggling month to month. Meanwhile, there’s this huge expansion of data centers…[People are wondering] Where is all that money coming from? How are our local governments giving away subsidies and public funds to incentivize these projects, when there’s so much need in our communities?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some cases, protests appear to be working and even halting (if only temporarily) planned developments. Data Center Watch <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims that</a> some $64 billion worth of developments have been blocked or delayed as the result of grassroots opposition. Cendejas is certainly a believer in the idea that organized action can halt companies in their tracks. “All this public pressure is working,” he said, noting that he could sense a “very palpable anger” around the issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, the tech industry is fighting back. Earlier this month, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/data-centers-have-a-political-problem-and-big-tech-wants-to-fix-it-00693695\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a> a relatively new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has been “distributing talking points to members of Congress and organizing local data center field trips to better pitch voters on their value.” Tech companies, including Meta, have been taking out ad campaigns to sell voters on the economic benefits of data centers, the outlet wrote. In short: The tech industry’s AI hopes are pegged to a compute buildout of epic proportions, so for now it’s safe to say that in 2026 the server surge will continue, as will the backlash and polarization that surround it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the actual data on the state of the region’s venture market shows a different reality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upshot: The European market has not recovered from the global venture capital reset that occurred in 2022 and 2023. But there is evidence it is on the cusp of a turnaround, including Klarna’s recent exit and the region’s homegrown AI startups garnering attention from local investors and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors poured €43.7 billion ($52.3 billion) into European startups in 2025 across 7,743 deals through the third quarter, according to PitchBook data. That means the yearly total is on pace to match — not exceed — the €62.1 billion invested in 2024 and €62.3 billion in 2023. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, U.S. venture deal volume in 2025 had already surpassed 2022, 2023, and 2024 by the end of the third quarter, according to PitchBook data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deal recovery isn’t Europe’s biggest problem, though — it’s VC firm fundraising. Through Q3 2025, European VC firms raised a mere €8.3 billion ($9.7 billion), which puts Europe on track for its lowest overall fundraising yearly total in a decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fundraising, LP to GP, is definitely the weakest area within Europe,” Navina Rajan, a senior analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “We’re on track for around 50% to 60% decline in the first nine months of this year. A lot of that is made up now by emerging managers versus experienced firms, and the mega funds that closed last year haven’t repeated this year.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Rajan doesn’t share the same fever that oozed out of attendees at Slush, she pointed to a few positive data points that suggest the European market is turning around.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, the participation of U.S. investors in European startup deals is back on the rise. Rajan said that figure dipped to a low in 2023 when U.S.-based VCs participated in just 19% of European venture deals. It has been steadily on the rise since, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They seem pretty optimistic on the European market,” Rajan said. “Just from an entry point of view, because you think about valuations, especially within AI tech and in the U.S., it’s just impossible to get in now, whereas, if you’re in Europe and your multiples are lower, and you’re new as an investor, it just provides a better entry point for perhaps similar tech.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable is one example of this shift. Vibe-coding companies have raised a lot of VC money in the United States. But U.S. investors also clearly love Lovable. The company just announced a new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/vibe-coding-startup-lovable-raises-330m-at-a-6-6b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$330 million Series B round</a> that was both led by and participated in by a slew of U.S.-based VCs, including Salesforce Ventures, CapitalG, and Menlo Ventures, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">French AI research lab Mistral has seen similar love from U.S.-based firms. <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-raises-1-7-b-to-accelerate-technological-progress-with-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mistral landed a €1.7 billion Series C round</a> in September that included Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, and Lightspeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Klarna’s recent exit also suggests a turnaround is underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swedish fintech giant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/klarnas-ipo-pops-raising-1-4b-with-sequoia-as-the-biggest-winner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Klarna went public</a> in September after raising $6.2 billion across two decades in the private market. That exit likely recycled some capital back to European LPs or gave them confidence in a changing exit environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Victor Englesson, a partner at Swedish EQT, the recent European success stories, like Klarna, have started to change how founders in Europe approach building their companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ambitious founders have seen what great looks like in companies like Spotify, Klarna, Revolut and are now starting companies with that type of ambition,” Englesson told TechCrunch. They’re not starting companies with like, I want to win in Europe, or I want to win in Germany. They start companies with a mindset that I want to win globally. I don’t think we have seen that to the same extent before.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That mindset has EQT, and others, bullish on Europe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For EQT, we’ve invested $120 billion in Europe [over the] last five years,” Englesson said. “We’re going to invest $250 billion [over the] next five years in Europe. So we are extremely committed to Europe.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That should have allowed the robotaxis to operate normally in spite of the massive outage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, many of the vehicles requested a “confirmation check” from Waymo’s <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fleet response team</a> to make sure what they were doing was correct. All Waymo robotaxis have the ability to make these confirmation checks. With such a widespread outage on Saturday, there was a “concentrated spike” in these confirmation requests, Waymo said, which helped create all the congestion caught on video.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said it built this confirmation request system “out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment” but that it is now refining it to “match our current scale.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the [self-driving software] with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,” the company wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software update will add “even more context about regional outages” to the company’s self-driving software. Waymo also said it will improve its emergency response protocols by “incorporating lessons from this event.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a lot of focus has been placed on the instances where Waymo’s robotaxis got stuck during the power outage, the company shared that its vehicles “successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology,” the company wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saturday’s mess is the latest example of how Waymo is still uncovering unforeseen issues with its software and its approach to designing a reliable fleet of self-driving vehicles. The company already had to ship multiple software updates to make its robotaxis wait for stopped school buses, which prompted a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/waymo-to-issue-software-recall-over-how-robotaxis-behave-around-school-buses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">led to a recall</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Waymo says it has used <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2025/12/demonstrably-safe-ai-for-autonomous-driving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gemini’s “world knowledge”</a> to train its autonomous vehicles to navigate complex, rare, and high-stakes scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: “a friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle” whose primary goal is “to enhance the rider’s experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.” The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the system prompts, when a rider activates the assistant via the in-car screen, Gemini can choose from a set of pre-approved greetings personalized with the rider’s first name. The system can also access contextual data about the rider, like how many Waymo trips they’ve been on. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The prompts currently let Gemini access and control in-car features, like the temperature, lighting and music. Notably absent from the function list are volume control, route changes, seat adjustment, and window control, Wong pointed out. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can’t control, the bot is to reply with “aspirational phrases,” like, “It’s not something I can do yet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, the assistant is directed to maintain a clear distinction between its identity as Gemini the AI bot and the autonomous driving technology (the Waymo Driver). So when replying to a question such as, “How do you see the road?” Gemini shouldn’t say “I use a combination of sensors,” and instead should reply, “The Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors…”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. So if a passenger asks about a video they saw of a Waymo hitting something, the bot is instructed to not answer directly and deflect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Your role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system’s performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,” the prompt reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The in-car assistant is allowed to answer general knowledge questions like about the weather, the height of the Eiffel Tower, what time the local Trader Joe’s closes, and who won the last World Series. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo isn’t the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-is-coming-to-tesla-vehicles-next-week-says-elon-musk/\">Tesla is doing something similar with xAI’s Grok</a>. The two different car assistants serve different functions, however. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mill may have started with households, but co-founder and CEO Matt Rogers says the food waste startup has long aspired to expand to commercial customers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This has been part of our plan since our Series A deck,” Rogers told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, with an official deal locked in with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/whole-foods-to-install-smart-food-waste-bins-from-mill-starting-in-2027/\">Amazon and Whole Foods</a> the company’s plan to profit from handling other people’s food waste is a bit more public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whole Foods will deploy a commercial-scale version of <a href=\"https://www.mill.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mill</a>’s food waste bin in each of its grocery stores beginning in 2027. The bins will grind and dehydrate waste from the produce department, reducing costly landfill fees while also providing feed for the company’s egg producers. Both trim the company’s overhead and lower its ecological footprint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, Mill’s bins will collect data to help Whole Foods understand what gets wasted and why, helping the grocer further control costs. “Ultimately, our goal is not just to make their waste operations more efficient, but also to move upstream so they actually waste less food,” Rogers said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company started selling food waste bins to households <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/17/nest-co-founder-matt-rogers-new-startup-is-trash/\">a few years ago</a>. As can be expected from a team that made the Nest thermostat, the devices are well designed and — to lean on a Silicon Valley cliché — they can be a delight to use. My kids got a kick out of the bins while testing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/mill-compost-review/\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/mills-redesigned-food-waste-bin-really-is-faster-and-quieter-than-before/\">second generations</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Starting in consumer was very intentional because you build the proof points, you build the data, the brand, loyalty,” Rogers said. Many members of the Whole Foods team were already familiar with Mill when the two companies started talking.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s actually kind of our enterprise sales strategy,” Rogers continued. “We have conversations with senior leadership at our various ideal customers, and if they haven’t had Mill at home yet, we say, ‘Hey, try Mill at home, see what your family thinks.’ It is a surefire way of getting folks excited.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup began having conversations with Whole Foods about a year ago, Rogers said. In the ensuing months, Mill demonstrated the consumer version in some of the chain’s grocery stores. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mill has also developed an AI that uses a range of sensors to determine whether food that enters the bin should still be on the shelf. Minimizing “shrink” — the industry’s term for sales lost through waste or theft — can give grocers an edge in a cutthroat market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advances in large language models have been key, Rogers said. When he and Mill co-founder Harry Tannenbaum were at Nest, it took dozens of engineers and a “Google budget” more than a year to train Nest Cameras to recognize people and packages. With new LLMs, Mill only needed a handful of engineers and far less time to deliver superior results, according to Rogers, who said “AI is a huge enabler.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The use of AI allowed Mill to deliver a commercial version faster, diversifying its customer base and source of revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you are a single channel, single customer business, you’re fragile,” Rogers said. “I grew up at Apple during the iPod era,” he said. “Apple at the time was a single leg business. iPod was like 70% of company revenue. This was why we did the iPhone. Steve [Jobs] pushed us really hard on the iPhone because he was worried that folks like Motorola — who were working on smartphones at the time — would start to eat our lunch on the iPod business and that that would crush us. We needed to build another leg of the stool.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it seems that Mill isn’t finished adding legs to its figurative stool. Rogers said it’s working on building out a municipal business as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re continuing to add more legs to the stool and adding more diversity to the business,” he said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In addition, it would have required the age data be shared with developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A judge, citing First Amendment concerns, blocked the law’s enforcement that was set to take effect in January. The ruling was a win for tech giants and a setback to Texas lawmakers, who said the legal fight will continue. The Texas attorney general’s office noted in a court filing that it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-texas-app-store-age-law-meant-protect-children-2025-12-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plans to appeal</a> the decision, a report from Reuters noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To comply with the coming law, Apple had announced in October a series of new requirements for apps in Texas, which included all users under the age of 18 would have to join a Family Sharing group, where parents or guardians would provide consent for all App Store downloads, app purchases, and in-app transactions. Parents would be able to revoke their consent for an app at any time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple also said its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Declared Age Range API</a>, a technology the company debuted to help it comply with the growing number of age-assurance laws worldwide, would be updated in the months ahead to provide the required age categories for new account users in Texas. Apple had planned to launch new APIs for developers to request parental consent again if their app was significantly updated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple had objected to this law, and similar laws arriving next year in Utah and Louisiana, on the grounds of privacy, not kids’ protection. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we share the goal of strengthening kids’ online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores,” Apple explained in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=btkirlj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a developer announcement</a> earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple on Thursday announced other developer tools for complying with new age-assurance laws will remain available for testing, including its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Declared Age Range API</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/PermissionKit/SignificantAppUpdateTopic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Significant Change API under PermissionKit</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/appstore/ageRatingCode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">New age rating property type in StoreKit</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications/notificationtype\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">App Store Server Notifications</a>. In addition, the Declared Age Range API is still available worldwide across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, and later.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude are prohibited from being distributed via the API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The European Commission this month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/eu-investigating-meta-over-policy-change-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">also launched an investigation</a> into the new policy, raising concerns that it may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling the Authority’s decision “fundamentally flawed,” Meta said WhatsApp’s business API isn’t a route to the market for AI companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. The Italian authority assumes WhatsApp is somehow a defacto app store. The route to market for AI companies are the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform. We will appeal,” Meta said in an emailed statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Note: This story was updated to add Meta’s response to the decision.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While it used to be just a boring animation of Santa’s sleigh and reindeer flying across a map, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/norad-santa-tracker-will-stay-on-even-if-the-government-shuts-down/\">NORAD</a> has added tons of features<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/04/tracking-santa-has-never-been-so-technologically-friendly/\"> since then</a>, such as fun mini-games, videos, stories, and Christmas music.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, NORAD’s Santa Tracker <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/norad-holiday-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">teamed up with OpenAI</a> to introduce new AI-powered features. These include an image generator that transforms your selfie into an animated elf character, a tool for generating toy ideas and converting them into printable coloring book pages, and a fill-in-the-blank storytelling tool that allows families to add names, places, and other details to create a fun holiday story to read aloud.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-destinationlink=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png\" data-event=\"clickable_image\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2460192\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png 1337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=1200,634 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=1280,676 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=900,475 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=800,422 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=668,353 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=1168,617 1168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=708,374 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-17-at-3.26.41-PM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1337px) 100vw, 1337px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>NORAD</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than a 2D model, the NORAD Santa tracker has a 3D visual depiction of Santa’s journey, as the platform was built on <a href=\"https://cesium.com/blog/2018/12/14/tech-behind-santa-tracker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cesium</a>’s open source 3D mapping library.

Indeed, DJI is considered to be one of the <a href=\"https://wpln.org/post/many-americans-have-come-to-rely-on-chinese-made-drones-now-lawmakers-want-to-ban-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most popular drone brands</a> for American consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment by TechCrunch, DJI said it disapproved of the decision. “DJI is disappointed by the Federal Communications Commission’s action today to add foreign‑made drones to the Covered List. While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.”<br><br>The company, which said that it remained committed to the U.S. market, continued: “As the industry leader, DJI has advocated for an open, competitive market that benefits all US consumers and commercial users, and will continue to do so. DJI products are among the safest and most secure on the market, supported by years of reviews conducted by U.S. government agencies and independent third parties.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Throughout his multiple presidential administrations, Trump has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/471884/nvidia-chips-china-trump-huang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">played hardball</a> with Chinese companies. His administration laid the groundwork for the new drone ban with <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/unleashing-american-drone-dominance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an executive order</a> passed in June that sought to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5425465/trump-drones-world-cup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">boost the production</a> of U.S.-made drones and thus foster a “strong and secure domestic drone sector,” while also securing “the United States drone supply chain against foreign control or exploitation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The voluntary recall of its software affected 332 vehicles, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCLRPT-25E090-1680.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to documents</a> filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there have not been any collisions associated with the issue, Zoox noted in the NHTSA filing that it could increase the risk of a crash. The company provides free rides to the public in its <a href=\"https://zoox.com/where-to-ride/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">driverless Zoox vehicles</a> in parts of San Francisco and Las Vegas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Zoox spokesperson told TechCrunch the company identified some instances in which its vehicles made maneuvers that, while common for human drivers, didn’t meet its standards. For example, in an effort to avoid blocking certain intersections at a red light, the robotaxi might stop in a crosswalk. In other instances, the robotaxi made a late turn, resulting in a wide turn, according to a spokesperson’s emailed statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue was initially identified on August 26 when a Zoox robotaxi made a wide right turn, crossed partially into the opposing travel lane, and temporarily stopped in front of the oncoming travel lane, according to the NHTSA filing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox monitored its data for additional lane crossings near intersections, ultimately identifying 62 instances between August 26 and December 5. The company said in the filing it was in “ongoing conversations with NHTSA about the frequency, severity, and root causes of these occurrences.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company updated its software on November 7 and again in mid-December to address all of the issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have successfully identified and deployed targeted software improvements to address the root causes of these incidents,” the statement reads. “Today, we’re submitting a voluntary software recall because transparency and safety is foundational to Zoox, and we want to be open with the public and regulators about how we are constantly refining and improving our technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software recall affected Zoox vehicles operating on public roads between March 13 and December 18, according to the filing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox has issued several software recalls this year, including one in March to address <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/zoox-recalls-258-self-driving-cars-over-unexpected-braking/\">unexpected hard braking</a>.

The biggest hack by far was the breach at Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit, where <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/crypto-exchange-bybit-says-it-was-hacked-and-lost-around-1-4-billion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hackers stole around $1.4 billion</a> in crypto. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/researchers-accuse-north-korea-of-1-4-billion-bybit-crypto-heist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blockchain analysis firms</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/fbi-says-north-korea-responsible-for-1-4-billion-bybit-heist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FBI</a>, accused North Korean government hackers — the most prolific group targeting crypto in the last few years — of this massive heist.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was the largest known loot of crypto of all time, and one of the largest financial heists in the history of humanity. Before the Bybit hack, the largest crypto thefts netted $624 million and $611 million for hackers in the 2022 breaches against the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/15/us-officials-link-north-korean-lazarus-hackers-to-625m-axie-infinity-crypto-theft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ronin Network</a> and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/29/axie-infinitys-ronin-network-suffers-%E2%89%88625m-exploit-in-largest-defi-hack-to-date/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Poly Network</a>, respectively. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cryptocurrency-monitoring firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs both estimated a total of $2.7 billion stolen in crypto in 2025, per data shared with TechCrunch. Chainalysis also tracked another $700,000 stolen from individual crypto wallets, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">De.Fi, the web3 security firm running the <a href=\"https://de.fi/rekt-database\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">REKT database</a> that tracks crypto thefts, also estimated $2.7 billion in stolen and hacked crypto last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As usual, North Korean government hackers were the most successful crypto thieves throughout 2025, after stealing at least $2 billion, according to Chainalysis and Elliptic, which estimated that Kim Jong Un’s hackers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/north-korean-hackers-stole-over-2-billion-in-crypto-so-far-in-2025-researchers-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">have stolen around $6 billion since 2017</a>. North Korea uses crypto thefts to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other significant crypto hacks this year included the one against <a href=\"https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-cetus-hack-may-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cetus</a>, a decentralized exchange, which netted the hackers $223 million; the breach against <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/how-an-attacker-drained-128m-from-balancer-through-rounding-error-exploitation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Balancer</a>, a protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in a loss of $128 million; and the one against the crypto exchange <a href=\"https://phemex.com/announcements/phemex-hot-wallet-security-incident-update-and-timeline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Phemex</a>, where cybercriminals stole more than $73 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cybercriminals targeting crypto exchanges and other DeFi projects are not slowing down.

His dad built homes for major developers, and his mom sold to big-box builders across the East Coast. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Donahue was particularly interested in why designing a custom home cost a fortune and took forever, and why most people had to settle for whatever the developers were offering that year. So when he dropped out of NC State and moved to the Bay Area, he eventually did what you might expect a college dropout to do in San Francisco: He started a company to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That effort, Atmos, went through Y Combinator, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/yc-khosla-backed-atmos-lands-12-5m-to-help-people-design-their-dream-homes-real-estate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $20 million</a> from investors like Khosla Ventures and Sam Altman, and tried to use tech to streamline the custom home design process. It had designers on staff who worked with clients while software handled the back end. It grew to 40 people and $7 million in revenue, and they designed $200 million worth of houses and built 50.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All that sounds great until you hear Donahue describe it. “It became this extremely operational business,” he told me on a Zoom call last week. “Kind of like a glamorized architecture firm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It never quite replaced the humans, in other words. Then the Federal Reserve started jacking up interest rates, and suddenly clients who’d spent months designing their dream homes couldn’t afford them anymore. Nine months ago, Donahue shut it down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s where most founders would take a break, maybe write a few LinkedIn posts about what they learned. Instead, Donahue regrouped and started another company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.drafted.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Drafted</a> is now nearly five months old, and it’s everything Atmos wasn’t. No designers on staff. No operational complexity. Just AI-driven software that generates residential floor plans and exterior designs in minutes. You tell it what you want — bedrooms, square footage, whatever — and it spits out five designs. Don’t like them? You can generate five more and keep going until something clicks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, Drafted has six employees, four from Atmos, and it’s raised $1.65 million at a $35 million post-money valuation from Bill Clerico of Convective Capital, Stripe’s Patrick Collison, Jack Altman, Josh Buckley, and Warriors player Moses Moody.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clerico led the round because he’d also been an angel investor in Atmos and had watched Donahue will houses into existence despite rising interest rates. When Donahue told him about the new company over coffee, Clerico didn’t need convincing. “Nick, please take our money,” he apparently said repeatedly over a two-week period until Donahue agreed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pitch is straightforward. Right now, if you want a custom home, you’ve got two options: hire an architect (expensive, slow), or buy a template plan online (cheap, inflexible). Drafted sits in the middle, offering customization at template prices. A complete plan costs between $1,000 and $2,000. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The economics work because Drafted built its own AI model, trained on real house plans from homes that were built and passed permitting. Practical constraints are considered, and Donahue says the specialized model costs almost nothing to run: two-tenths of a penny per floor plan, compared to 13 cents for general-purpose AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Drafted only does single-story homes right now, but multi-story and lot-specific features are coming. The bigger question is whether there’s actually a market for this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers aren’t huge. Of the million new homes built in America each year, only 300,000 are custom designed. Most people buy existing homes or pick from whatever tract homes the big builders are offering. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clerico’s argument is that this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Make custom design cheap and fast enough, and many more people will do it. Donahue compares it to Uber, which didn’t just replace taxis but made on-demand car service something that nearly everyone uses. “There’s really no reason in the future why everyone shouldn’t have a totally custom-designed home,” Clerico says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or maybe most Americans will keep being price-conscious buyers who take what’s available. The housing market has a long track record of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/made-renovation-which-intrigued-then-infuriated-its-customers-is-shutting-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rebuffing disruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also the “moat” question. Asked what’s to keep an LLM player or even another vertical player from buying similar datasets and creating the same product, Donahue talks about brand, pointing to his friend David Holz, who founded the video and image generating AI outfit, Midjourney. Despite the plethora of new image-generation models being launched, Midjourney’s usage barely moves, Holz has told Donahue; its customers keep coming back to make AI images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Donahue thinks if they move fast enough and please enough customers, Drafted can become the place for people to design houses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Time will tell. Since opening to the public, the outfit has begun seeing about 1,000 daily users. Not huge numbers, but they show steady growth for such a young product.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Donahue has something pretty valuable that could give Drafted an edge: deep knowledge of a problem and the insights gleaned from taking a crack at it once already.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Pictured above, the Drafted crew, left to right: Martynas Pocius, Albert Chiu, Martina Cheru, Carson Poole, Stephen Chou, and Nick Donahue</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
