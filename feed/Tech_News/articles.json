Despite the strategic priority that the hardware product represents, the company recently shed one of the top executives tied to the project, reportedly over a dispute with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech blog Sources <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/alexeheath/status/2024340366582038960?s=20\">originally reported</a> that the company had recently lost Scott Myers, its SVP of Specs, over a supposed “blow-up” with Spiegel.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment by TechCrunch, a Snap spokesperson said that Myers had “decided to step down from his role at Snap.” The statement thanked him for his contributions, and wished him “the best in his next chapter.” The spokesperson also disputed the “blow-up” characterization but wouldn’t reveal more about Myers’ departure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spokesperson added: “We can’t wait to bring Specs to the world later this year. We remain focused on disciplined execution and long-term value creation for our developer partners, community and shareholders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear when exactly Myers left the company, or what the alleged “blow-up” might have entailed. When a user on X asked Sources author Alex Heath about the nature of the reported dispute, he replied that it was about “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/alexeheath/status/2024344234636304493?s=20\">strategy</a>,” adding that he couldn’t reveal more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap has teased the commercial release of Specs for quite a while and, in recent months, has signaled that it’s getting serious about the product’s launch. In January, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">spun off the Specs team</a> into its own distinct subsidiary, Specs Inc., saying that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Myers joined the Snap team in 2020 and, prior to that, held roles at SpaceX, Apple, and Nokia, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-myers-7a63b22/\">his LinkedIn</a> profile. In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/exclusive-i-asked-snaps-hardware-chief-about-the-companys-next-gen-specs-heres-what-i-found-out\">an interview</a> with Tom’s Guide last summer, Myers called the development process for Specs an “entirely new paradigm” but also discussed the tricky nature of getting its form factor just right. “I don’t want to see people wearing a wire coming out of the back of their head,” he quipped.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s unclear why Cellebrite has changed its approach, which appears contrary to its previous actions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, researchers at The University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/research/cellebrite-used-on-kenyan-activist-and-politician-boniface-mwangi/\">published a report</a> alleging the Kenyan government used Cellebrite’s tools to unlock the phone of Boniface Mwangi, a local activist and politician, while he was in police custody. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/research/from-protest-to-peril-cellebrite-used-against-jordanian-civil-society/\">In another report</a> from January, the Citizen Lab accused the Jordanian government of breaking into the phones of several local activists and protesters using Cellebrite’s tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In both investigations, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/citizen-lab-director-warns-cyber-industry-about-us-authoritarian-descent/\">the Citizen Lab</a>, an organization that has investigated abuses of spyware and hacking technologies around the world, based their conclusions on finding traces of a specific application linked to Cellebrite on the victims’ phones. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers said that those traces are a “high confidence” signal that someone used Cellebrite’s unlocking tools on the phones in question, because the same application had been previously found on VirusTotal, a malware repository, and was signed with digital certificates owned by Cellebrite.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other researchers have also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259893601_Android_Anti-forensics_Modifying_CyanogenMod\">linked the same application</a> to Cellebrite.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do not respond to speculation and encourage any organization with specific, evidence-based concerns to share them with us directly so we can act on them,” Victor Cooper, a spokesperson for Cellebrite, told TechCrunch in an email. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why Cellebrite is acting differently from the Serbia case, Cooper said “the two situations are incomparable,” and that, “high confidence is not direct evidence.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cooper did not respond to multiple follow-up emails asking if Cellebrite would investigate the Citizen Lab’s latest report, and what, if any, differences there are with its case in Serbia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Cellebrite, or other similar companies?

That figure is also down year-over-year from 158,000 in 2024, and 333,000 in 2023.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png\" alt=\"a screenshot showing a graphic of Google numbers, including 1.75 million policy-violating apps from being published to Google play. \" class=\"wp-image-3094599\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SafeAppEcosystem_HeroVisual_3Claims_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google touted how its investments in AI and other real-time defenses have helped fight these sorts of threats, but also how they served as a deterrent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Initiatives like developer verification, mandatory pre-review checks, and testing requirements have raised the bar for the Google Play ecosystem, significantly reducing the paths for bad actors to enter,” the company’s blog post explained, adding that its “AI-powered, multi-layer protections” have been “discouraging bad actors from publishing malicious apps.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google noted it now runs over 10,000 safety checks on every app it publishes and continues to recheck apps after publication. The company has also integrated its latest generative AI models into the app review process, which has helped human reviewers find more complex malicious patterns faster. Google said it plans to increase its AI investments in 2026 to stay ahead of emerging threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Google said it prevented more than 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data, a figure that’s down from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2025/01/how-we-kept-google-play-android-app-ecosystem-safe-2024.html\">1.3 million in 2024</a>. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings and reviews last year, and prevented an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_bomb\">review bombing</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Android’s defense system, known as Google Play Protect, identified more than 27 million new malicious apps, and warned users or blocked the app from running. That’s an increase from the 13 million non-Play Store apps identified in 2024 and five million seen in 2023. These increases seem to suggest that bad actors are now more often avoiding the Play Store when targeting users with their malicious apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, it is the fastest-growing unit within the battery recycling and materials startup — a reflection of an AI data center building boom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The evidence of that growth, the company says, can be found at its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/redwood-materials-preps-for-expansion-spree-with-new-rd-center-in-san-francisco/\">R&amp;D lab</a> in San Francisco, which has expanded four-fold into a 55,000-square-foot facility and now employs nearly 100 people. Those are small figures compared to Redwood’s total workforce of 1,200 people and its sprawling campus at its Carson City, Nevada headquarters and another facility near Reno. But its value and recent expansion are tied directly to its burgeoning energy storage that launched in June 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco facility, which opened in April 2025, is where engineers integrate the hardware, software, and power electronics for energy storage systems that power data centers, AI computing, and other large-scale industrial applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/news/redwood-quadruples-san-francisco-r-d-footprint-to-support-redwood-energy-success/\">said in a blog post </a>Thursday the expansion will support a wave of energy storage deployments related to data centers. The company’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/redwood-attracts-google-for-its-425m-series-e-as-ai-power-needs-rise/\">$425 million Series E</a> raise will provide the capital needed to scale the business. Google, a new investor, as well as existing backer Nvidia, joined the round to support Redwood’s energy storage business venture.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI data centers have definitely been a pressing area of focus,” Claire McConnell, vice president of business development told TechCrunch in a recent interview, who added there are other use cases for its systems including supporting renewable projects like solar and wind. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers have been around for decades, but advancements in AI have spurred a building spree and a need for reliable electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What data center developers are seeing is something that they hadn’t experienced before,” McConnell said. “When they’re trying to connect to the grid, they are being told it is going to take five-plus years to get that and at the same time, you’re seeing this massive demand to build more data centers and compete in the AI race.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Redwood Materials was founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics, which was processed and then sold to customers such as Panasonic. The company also expanded into the battery materials business and today produces cathodes for battery cells. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company opened <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/redwood-materials-launches-energy-storage-business-and-its-first-target-is-ai-data-centers/\">Redwood Energy</a> last summer to leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Redwood Energy’s first customer is Crusoe, a startup that, in 2021, Straubel invested in. Redwood setup an energy storage system that uses old EV batteries that are not yet ready for recycling. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas — the initial site of the Stargate project. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McConnell said customers that are in the pipeline include hyperscalers — companies that operate massive cloud computing data centers and consume hundreds of megawatts of power — that would far exceed the capacity of its project with Crusoe.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re working on ones in the hundreds of megawatt hours, and we have ones in the pipeline that are multiple gigawatt hours,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Studies suggest that roles where <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-us-labor-market\">AI can automate most tasks will be impacted</a>, though some <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-will-ai-affect-the-global-workforce\">analysts</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://time.com/7357476/economics-of-ai-and-jobs/\">believe</a> that AI may also create jobs, with the displacement effect only transitional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Shim, CEO of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/read-ai-raises-50m-to-integrate-its-bot-with-slack-email-and-more/\">meeting notetaker and intelligence company Read AI</a>, told TechCrunch at Web Summit Qatar earlier this month that even with the rise of AI tools, it will ultimately be humans who decide the course of action, and their job will be important. He equated the technology with using maps in a car.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there’s always going to be a human in the middle,” Shim said. “I think the job is going to get easier over time. But a good example would be like driving a car. When we first started, you used to have a map. And you’d pull out the map. And you’d go in and say okay I’m driving. I’m deciding what happens. Now everyone uses Waze or Google Maps, and the map is telling you where to go. And you’re just following that order. But you’re the human in the middle who can decide what happens.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shim acknowledged that AI would affect jobs, noting that advertising agencies may lose human roles in favor of automated tools. However, he noted that tech platforms would need jobs to oversee the automation process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abdullah Asiri, founder of AI-powered consumer support tooling startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lucidya.com/en\">Lucidya</a>, said that he believes that AI will replace tasks but not roles. He said that when his company’s clients use Lucidya, customer support agents often take up different roles and responsibilities. He noted that some become supervisors who guide other humans and AI, while some take up relationship-building and business development responsibilities using the time they saved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Read AI’s Shim noted that meeting notetakers have freed up humans from taking notes manually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody here wants to sit down and take meeting notes, but as you start to take away that job, you have a little bit more time to do other things that you can go and focus on. You can send that report a little bit faster, or you can respond back to a customer and actually have better context to make better decisions, versus spending a bunch of time gathering all the information and having little time to make a decision,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-s-internal-use-and-hiring\">AI’s internal use and hiring</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As tech companies like Read AI and Lucidya are increasingly using AI tools, they want to keep their teams lean. Currently, Read AI’s customer service team consists of just five people, who serve millions of monthly users. Shim noted that the company is using AI tools to make a small team more productive and give them more context to help them do their job more quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies are said to be reaping productivity gains. Read AI said that its sales tool helps predict the state of a deal using data from CRM systems like HubSpot and Salesforce. The startup said that it has seen deals worth $200 million approved through that system. Shim said Read AI captures 23% more context with each update, which could be used to evaluate what worked or what didn’t in a lead call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucidya’s Asiri also noted that the company uses AI tools, including Read AI, for meetings and marketing asset creation. He said that the company wants “scale outcomes without scaling headcounts.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The goal for any company is to hire people who are AI native, who are very strong with AI, but we need to be realistic,” Asiri said. “Today, this skill is being developed. You cannot find a lot of people who have very strong AI capabilities, not building AI, but using AI.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091418\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=768,544 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=680,482 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=430,305 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=720,510 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=668,473 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=529,375 529w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=708,502 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Lucidya CEO Abdullah Asiri Image Credits: Ramsey Cardy/Web Summit Qatar via Sportsfile</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asiri noted that people who would be able to build agents that can help them do their job would be more desirable to hire.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-handling-customer-perception-of-ai\">Handling customer perception of AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shim noted that just a few years ago, many people were hesitant to have AI notetakers in meetings and didn’t understand why a bot was on the call. However, now people are more receptive to notetakers as long as you give them controls around recording, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asiri said that Lucidya discloses to users when it’s using a voice AI to communicate. He said that for users, issue resolution is more important than the fact that an AI bot is handling their calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s all about resolving issues and finding customers’ problems and resolving them,” Asiri said. “As long as the AI agents are actually focusing on that part, customers are happy that their issues are being resolved. The customer really doesn’t care whether it’s fixed by AI or a human, as long as it’s fixed fast and accurately.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature offers suggested questions based on the video, or users can use their remote’s microphone button to ask anything related to the video. For instance, they might ask about recipe ingredients or the background of a song’s lyrics, and receive instant answers without pausing or leaving the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, this feature is available to a select group of users over 18 and supports English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube first launched this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/youtube-to-test-generative-ai-features-including-a-comments-summarizer-and-conversational-tool/\">conversational AI tool</a> in 2024 to help viewers explore content in greater depth. The expansion to TVs comes as more Americans now access YouTube through their television than ever before. A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">Nielsen report</a> from April 2025 found that YouTube accounted for 12.4% of total television audience time, surpassing major platforms like Disney and Netflix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies are also making significant strides with their conversational AI technologies. Amazon rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/alexa-comes-to-new-fire-tv-devices-with-ai-powered-conversations/\">Alexa+ on Fire TV devices</a>, enabling users to engage in natural conversations and ask Alexa+ for tailored content recommendations, hunt for specific scenes in movies, or even ask questions about actors and filming locations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.roku.com/article/208756908#section-5\">Roku</a> has enhanced its AI voice assistant to handle open-ended questions about movies and shows, such as “What’s this movie about?” or “How scary is it?” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/netflix-debuts-its-generative-ai-powered-search-tool/\">Netflix</a> is also testing its AI search experience. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another way YouTube has tried to improve its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/youtubes-latest-updates-are-aimed-at-improving-the-tv-experience/\">TV experience with AI</a> is the recent launch of a feature that automatically enhances videos uploaded at lower resolutions to full HD.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the company continues to launch other AI features, like a comments summarizer that helps viewers catch up on video discussions and an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/youtube-adds-an-ai-overviews-like-search-results-carousel/\">AI-driven search results carousel</a>.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a year-long pilot project, Toyota’s Canadian manufacturing subsidiary has contracted seven humanoid robots to work in a plant building RAV4 SUVs under a robots-as-a-service deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After evaluating a number of robots, we are excited to deploy Digit to improve the team member experience and further increase operational efficiency in our manufacturing facilities,” Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada President Tim Hollander said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Digit robot in question is built by Agility Robotics, a firm spun out of Oregon State University in 2015. Digit is intended to work in industrial environments without humans nearby, often bridging two different automated production lines. In this case, the robots will be unloading totes full of auto parts from an automated warehouse tugger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While seven robots doing manual drudgery may seem a small step compared to sizzle reels of metal humans doing backflips, actually deploying humanoid robots in real workplaces is rare and difficult. Demonstrating a capability in a lab is one thing, but integrating it into a company’s workflow — including maintenance and charging — isn’t easy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When the tech companies spend real time in the field understanding the task that needs to be operated, the real workflows that happens…that’s when we will see a huge uptick in adoption,” Ram Devarajulu, a VP at Cambridge Consultants, said at the Humanoids Summit in late 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agility is among the leaders in getting robots out of the lab, with Digits working in similar capacities for logistics providers like GXO, Schaeffler, and Amazon. The company has a proprietary cloud-based software package called Arc for users to manage fleets of their robots, and says AI will be vital in reducing deployment costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Cost of deployment … can be more than the price of the robot by a lot,” Pras Velagapudi, Agility’s CTO, said in an interview last year. “AI tools let us decrease that cost of deployment, decrease the amount of time getting the robot configured and getting it operating at a level of performance that they want.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMMC and Agility will use this engagement as an opportunity to pioneer other use cases that relieve human workers of repetitive physical tasks and prioritize more valuable work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also preparing a next generation robot that will be safe to operate alongside human workers; current humanoid robots that are strong enough to lift heavy loads are still considered too unreliable to operate autonomously around people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Competitor Figure.AI <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.figure.ai/news/production-at-bmw\">tested</a> its Figure 02 robots in a BMW factory for ten months last year, which the company said unloaded 90,000 parts. Other companies deploying humanoids in pilot programs include Apptronic, Unitree, Tesla, Boston Dynamics, 1X Technology, and Reflex Robotics. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Gay guys have the orgy. It doesn’t mean it’s problematic. It’s a way we bond and connect.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The piece doesn’t let the culture off the hook entirely. As is true wherever power dynamics exist, nine of the gay men interviewed describe experiencing unwanted advances from more senior colleagues — and Bernard doesn’t shy from examining where networking ends and coercion begins. But her sources are careful about what that means: “This is a complex subject and I don’t think readers can draw the distinction between some bad men being gay and all gay men being bad. It can be a slippery slope into homophobia.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Now it wants its own court, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase’s city administrator submitted a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2.18.2026-Packet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proposed ordinance</a> to the city commission during a meeting on Wednesday that would create a municipal court with a part-time judge, prosecutor, and court clerk. Starbase’s mayor will serve as the judge until one is appointed to a two-year term. The administrator wrote that he hopes to have a candidate ready by next month’s meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The formation of a court within Starbase, which currently claims around 580 residents and sits adjacent to SpaceX’s South Texas rocket factory and launch facility, is the latest in a series of steps the city has taken to build up its own municipal services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the volunteer fire department, Starbase is also now handling its own building permits and fire code inspections. And when a plan to contract local county sheriff’s deputies to patrol the city fell apart, the city <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/elon-musks-spacex-company-town-is-getting-a-police-department/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decided instead to start up the Starbase Police Department</a>. (The city is still paying the Cameron County Sheriff’s Department to use its jail facilities, though, according to paperwork filed ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase is still in the process of establishing the police department, and it expects that process could take around six months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During Wednesday’s meeting, the city commission reviewed an application to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement that is required to stand up the police force. That application revealed some new details about the plans for the new Starbase Police Department.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The city wrote that its expanding population has led to an increase in calls for service. Across 2025, there were 420 calls to law enforcement in the city, 180 calls for fire service, and 140 EMS calls, according to the application. There were also 353 crashes documented in the area last year, with more than 7,000 vehicles traveling Highway 4 — the main artery in and out of Starbase — per day. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Cameron County Sheriff’s Office has not been able to “guarantee dedicated law enforcement coverage for Starbase,” the city wrote, and Starbase’s remote geographic location “requires rapid and reliable” response times. “These limitations have raised significant concerns among residents and city leadership,” the city wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The city’s unique blend of cutting-edge technology and coastal charm, coupled with high median household incomes and rising property values, drives expectations for municipal services, particularly public safety,” the city wrote in the application. The city was also sure to point out that SpaceX launches, which are expected to dramatically increase over the next few years, draw many tourists to the area. “Additionally, The City has a substantial governmental interest in ensuring the integrity of spaceflight operations occurring within its jurisdiction,” the application reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company on Thursday announced the official launch of a trio of options, including Split View, PDF annotations, and a Save to Google Drive feature, designed to more deeply integrate Chrome with one of Google’s other online services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While these particular additions aren’t focused on AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/google-brings-gemini-in-chrome-to-us-users-unveils-agentic-browsing-capabilities-and-more/\">Google already integrated its Gemini AI assistant into Chrome</a>. The move was made in response to the increased competition from AI providers like OpenAI and Perplexity, which are dabbling in agentic browsers. These so-called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/as-the-browser-wars-heat-up-here-are-the-hottest-alternatives-to-chrome-and-safari-in-2025/\">browser wars</a> have pushed Google to be less stagnant in terms of developing and releasing more consumer-facing features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Split View, multitasking in Chrome has become easier as the feature puts two pages side-by-side in the same tab. This lets you work across two web pages or watch a video while taking notes, among other things. To use the feature, you’ll drag a tab to the left or right edge of the browser window or right-click a link and select “Open Link in Split View.” The tabs will automatically snap into place. When no longer needed, you can exit the Split View layout via an option found via a right-click.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094518\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=430,278 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=720,466 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=900,582 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=800,518 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=668,432 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=580,375 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=954,617 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=708,458 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another practical addition is the PDF annotations feature, which lets you add notes to a PDF or highlight its text from the browser.

The move comes as Reddit launched its <a href=\"https://www.business.reddit.com/blog/dynamic-product-ads-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first shoppable ad product</a> last year, called Dynamic Product Ads (DPA), which display personalized product recommendations to users based on their interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, when users who are part of the test search for something like “best noise-canceling headphones” or “electronic gift ideas for a college student,” they will see a carousel of related products at the bottom of the results. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This carousel will feature products directly mentioned by users from conversations on related posts and comments. If users tap on the product, they can view more details and then be directed to the retailer to purchase the item. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This feature surfaces top-recommended products directly from discussions, giving redditors instant information about any product,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/news/in-case-you-saw-it-we-are-testing-a-new-shopping-product-experience-in-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “This test is designed to make Reddit easier to navigate while keeping community perspectives at the center of the experience. We’ll continue learning from how people use this new feature and refine the experience over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While platforms like TikTok and Instagram have long integrated shopping features, Reddit is now looking to follow suit. Of course, Reddit isn’t the only tech platform that recently started exploring AI-driven shopping, as OpenAI’s ChatGPT rolled out an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">“Instant Checkout”</a> feature last September that lets users make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thursday’s announcement comes after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/\">Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said</a> during the company’s earnings release last week that the platform’s AI search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business, not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huffman also noted that weekly active users for search grew 30% over the past year, increasing from 60 million to 80 million, while weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers feature rose from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Starting April 2026, the website will no longer be available.

If you can’t remember your PIN, you can reset it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes a few months after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/facebook-messengers-desktop-app-is-no-more/\">Meta shut down Messenger’s standalone desktop apps</a> for Windows and Mac. The writing may have been on the wall at the time, as Meta had been redirecting existing desktop app users to the Facebook website to continue using the messaging service, rather than the Messenger website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change was first spotted by reverse engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2023763715674566705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>. Meta is notifying users of the update via a pop-up message on the Messenger website and app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users have taken to social media to <a href=\"https://x.com/_snow118/status/2023722050783945129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">express their frustration</a> with the update, with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1r6pxzp/why_does_meta_keep_removing_every_service_that/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many saying</a> they don’t want to rely on the Facebook website to send and receive Messenger chats on the web, especially those who have deactivated their Facebook accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta’s decision to shut down various Messenger platforms is frustrating for users, it allows the tech giant to reduce costs by leaving it with fewer platforms to maintain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Messenger first launched as “Facebook Chat” back in 2008, and Facebook (now Meta) launched Facebook Messenger as a standalone app in 2011. Over the years, the tech giant positioned Messenger as its own service outside of Facebook, and in 2014, the social network removed messaging capabilities from its main mobile app to push people to the Messenger app. However, the company reversed this in 2023 when it began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/07/facebooks-latest-test-brings-back-in-app-messaging/\">merging Messenger</a> back into the Facebook app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler confirmed to TechCrunch that the proposal has been pulled. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” Butler said in an emailed statement. Bloomberg was the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/new-york-s-robotaxi-plan-pulled-in-setback-to-waymo-expansion?srnd=homepage-americas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first to report</a> the proposal had been removed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The withdrawal is a setback for Waymo which has tried for years — along with other autonomous vehicle (AV) companies — to test and eventually deploy robotaxis in New York.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home,” Waymo said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They want the safety, privacy, and comfort that riders in other major cities already enjoy. While we are disappointed by the Governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety. We will continue to engage constructively with the Governor, the Legislature, and officials around the state to deliver this proven mobility option that New Yorkers are waiting for,” added Waymo’s statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hochul had introduced, as part of her <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/new-york-governor-clears-path-for-robotaxis-everywhere-with-one-notable-exception/\">broader budget proposal</a>, a plan to change a state law that mandates drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That law essentially prevents robotaxi companies like Waymo from operating in the state since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Hochul’s proposal had survived, it would not have opened the floodgates to AV companies. The proposal contained a number of limitations, including that AV companies could not deploy for-hire robotaxi services in any city with more than a million people. AV companies would also need approval from the state’s transportation commissioner, pay a $1 million fee, and show proof of financial security of at least $5 million. The state would have only backed robotaxi pilots in cities or townships where there was a clear demonstration of local support, Butler said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that proposal dead, the state’s existing AV pilot program, which is far more restrictive, is expected to remain. Under the pilot program, companies can seek an exemption to the one-hand on the wheel rule, allowing them to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state, but not launch commercial robotaxi services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is currently testing in New York City, and is allowed to do so through March 31. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New York City regulators granted a permit last August to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city. Under that permit, Waymo is allowed to test up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, as long as there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is active in numerous other states and operates commercial robotaxi services in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it provides more than 400,000 paid rides every week and is targeting 1 million weekly rides by the end of the year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The trial, taking place in LA Superior Court, already revealed that Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/metas-own-research-found-parental-supervision-doesnt-really-help-curb-teens-compulsive-social-media-use/\">own research indicated</a> that parental supervision couldn’t prevent teens from compulsive use of social media, and teens who faced traumatic life experiences were even more inclined to overuse social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for the plaintiff, a 20-year-old who goes by her initials KGM, questioned Zuckerberg this week about whether Instagram employees were given goals to increase daily app usage. The Meta CEO had said during an earlier congressional hearing that this was not the case, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-trial-testimony-instagram-c8cbaa32ccbf4933ec3a7beebd6cf34b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the AP noted</a>, but a 2015 email chain presented as evidence in the trial showed Zuckerberg pushing to increase <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-trial-0e9a7fa0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">users’ time spent in app by 12%</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg was also asked about Instagram’s use of beauty filters, which Meta’s own experts said should be banned when it comes to teens, as well as internal documents with Meta’s estimates of how many children under the age of 13 were on the platform. One <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-grilled-during-landmark-social-media-addiction-trial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Meta document from 2018 <span>stated that</span></a><span>, a</span>s of 2015, 4 million children under 13 had Instagram accounts, including roughly 30% of children aged 10-12 in the U.S., for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying age verification was difficult and smartphone makers like Apple could be more helpful on this front. (Apple recently rolled out its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\">own age assurance tools</a> for developers, as a result of the increasing push to regulate apps like Facebook and Instagram in the U.S., where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/apple-prepares-to-comply-with-texas-age-assurance-law-but-warns-of-privacy-risks/\">many</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/new-utah-law-makes-app-stores-responsible-for-age-verification/\">states</a> have <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/social-media-and-children-2025-legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">now created or are developing</a> their own social media laws.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-trial-testimony-instagram-c8cbaa32ccbf4933ec3a7beebd6cf34b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reports from the courtroom</a> noted Zuckerberg largely stuck to the company’s talking points during his testimony, sometimes claiming the plaintiff’s lawyers were <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-trial-0e9a7fa0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">taking things out of context</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-safety-trial.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mischaracterizing</a> what documents said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaintiff KGM (who also goes by her first name Kaley) sued four social media companies over what she alleges is the harmful and addictive nature of their platforms. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-joins-snap-to-settle-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">TikTok</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/snap-reaches-settlement-in-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">Snap</a> settled before the trial began, with YouTube and Meta defending their apps’ success. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the trial, lawyers for Meta have pointed to Kaley’s unhappy childhood as leading to her mental health concerns, not the social apps themselves. The results of this trial by jury could lead to big tech reforms, prompt new laws and regulations, and lead to a settlement with victims, if the tech companies are found to be at fault. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If completed, it would be the largest power plant in the U.S., capable of powering around 7.5 million homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a price tag of $33 billion, the project would be more expensive than recent natural gas-fired power plants, which have skyrocketed in cost, Bloomberg notes. It’s unclear who will ultimately foot the bill, though traditionally rate-payers have shouldered the burden for new generating capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Japanese investor is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">partner in the Stargate project</a> with OpenAI. SB Energy did not say whether the new power plant would feed directly into the grid or if it would power data centers. OpenAI and SoftBank are <a href=\"https://businessjournaldaily.com/preparation-work-begins-on-lordstown-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in the process of building</a> a “proof of concept” data center at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/foxconn-sells-former-gm-factory-to-mystery-buyer-after-failing-to-make-evs/\">GM’s former Lordstown automotive assembly plant</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A power plant of this size is likely to take years, perhaps a decade, to complete even before taking into account the shortage of natural gas turbines. If completed, the project could emit around 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to our calculations based on public, energy-use metrics. When <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/081.%20Gordon,%20Evaluating%20net%20life-cycle%20GHG%20emissions%20intensities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">including methane leaks</a> from the natural gas supply chain, the climate impact could be even bigger. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

For instance, new headlines and articles from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/feed/\">your favorite news site</a> would appear as new, unread entries in the RSS reader (aka news reader or feed reader) of your choice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The format was hugely popular in the early 2000s until the 2006 arrival of Twitter shifted people to another platform for real-time news and information sharing. Within a few years, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/rest-in-peace-rss/\">people were ditching Google’s popular RSS reader,</a> Google Reader, in favor of Twitter’s 140-character posts. Another few years later, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/rip-google-reader/\">Google Reader shut down for good</a>. (We still miss it.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But RSS itself never died. In addition to being the underlying tool for podcast distribution, you can still use the format to syndicate from websites through RSS apps like Feedly, NetNewsWire, Inoreader, <a href=\"https://reederapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reeder</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Current, however, proposes a different RSS experience. Instead of structuring feeds as lists to be processed, or unread counts driven to zero, the app’s main screen is a river.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094185\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg 2362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1200,634 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1280,676 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=900,476 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=800,423 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1536,812 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=2048,1082 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=668,353 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=1168,617 1168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=708,374 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Current-app-store.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Screenshot</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Current on the App Store</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re not watching content drift past like a screensaver.

Breaking news, for instance, remains bright for three hours, while daily news articles may stick around for around 18 hours.

It also notices when you regularly skip specific content or enthusiastically read it, and will suggest you either remove feeds you don’t read often or pin those that you do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Current lets you follow individual writers in a space called Voices, which differentiates blogs or newsletters written by individuals from feeds belonging to larger news publications. You can tap on any Voice to filter your feed to focus on just their content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(You can potentially follow individuals within larger publications if their writers have individual RSS feeds. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/sarah-perez/feed/\">Here’s mine</a>!)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094186\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg 1005w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=300,244 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=768,624 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=680,552 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=430,349 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=720,585 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=900,731 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=800,650 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=668,542 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=462,375 462w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=760,617 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=654,531 654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/current-voices.jpg?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Current</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Godier is interested in identifying voices behind the news, having authored a specification called <a href=\"https://www.bylinespec.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Byline</a> that adds author context to RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Voices” is just one of three built-in categories, which Current simply calls “currents” (hence the app’s name).

This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After this story was published, a Tenga spokesperson told TechCrunch that the breach affected “approximately 600 people” in the United States, based on a forensic review. “We have already proactively contacted those who may have been impacted to ensure their safety and provide guidance,” said the spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company spokesperson would not say if there was any multi-factor on the email account prior to the breach. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo. Tenga sells a variety of sex toys, mostly for men. It’s unclear if the breach affected customers outside of the United States, given that the email came explicitly from Tenga Store USA.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga is the latest in a long list of sex toy makers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/sex-toy-maker-lovense-caught-leaking-users-email-addresses-and-exposing-accounts-to-takeovers/\">such as Lovense last year</a>, and adult websites, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/hacking-group-says-its-extorting-pornhub-after-stealing-users-viewing-data/\">Pornhub</a> last year and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/sexting-site-sextpanther-data-exposed/\">SexPanther</a> in 2020, that have been hacked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>First published on February 13</em>. <em>Updated with comment from Tenga spokesperson.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Email addresses and phone numbers of parents, as well as information about children’s siblings, were also exposed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Florida-based VenturEd Solutions, which develops and maintains Ravenna Hub, <a href=\"https://www.ravennasolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">says</a> on Ravenna Hub’s website that it serves over a million students, and processes hundreds of thousands of applications a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch first learned of the vulnerability on Wednesday and soon after alerted the company. VenturEd fixed the bug the same day, but TechCrunch held this report until we could verify that the bug was fixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nick Laird, the chief executive of VenturEd Solutions, told TechCrunch in an email that the company was able to replicate the issue and has addressed the vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laird said the company was investigating the incident, but he would not commit to notifying users about the security lapse, or say — when asked by TechCrunch — if the company has the ability to check if there was any improper access to other users’ data. We also asked if Ravenna Hub had its security checked by a third-party, and if so, by whom. Laird would not say, and declined to comment further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear who, if anyone, oversees cybersecurity at VenturEd and Ravenna Hub.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/cisa-nsa-australia-idor-flaws/\">common security flaw</a> that allows users to access stored information because of weak or non-existent security controls on the concerned servers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, the bug allowed any logged-in user to access another student’s data, including their personal information, by modifying the unique number associated with a student’s profile using their web browser’s address bar. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Ravenna Hub, student numbers are sequential, meaning it was possible for any user to access another student’s data by changing the profile number by one or more digits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch created a new account with test data, we found that the web address contained a seven-digit number. As such, there were slightly more than 1.63 million records prior to ours that were accessible to any other user.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest security lapse involving simple security flaws affecting the personal information of children. In January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/ustrive-security-lapse-exposed-personal-data-of-its-users-including-children/\">online mentoring site UStrive exposed the personal information of its users</a>, many of whom are still in school. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
