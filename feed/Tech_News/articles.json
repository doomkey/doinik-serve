Anthropic</a> case, in which a group of fiction and nonfiction authors similarly accused the AI company of using their copyrighted works to train products like Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that case, Judge William Alsup ruled that it is legal for Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted content. However, he pointed out that it was not legal for Anthropic to acquire that content via piracy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bartz v. Anthropic case became a slap on the wrist worth $1.5 billion for Anthropic, with impacted writers receiving about $3,000 per work for roughly 500,000 copyrighted works. While $1.5 billion seems like a substantial sum, it’s not exactly back-breaking for a company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\">valued</a> at $183 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally, these music publishers had filed a lawsuit against Anthropic over its use of about 500 copyrighted works. But through the discovery process in the Bartz case, the publishers say they found that Anthropic had also illegally downloaded thousands more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The publishers tried to amend their original lawsuit to address the piracy issue, but the court denied that motion back in October, ruling they’d failed to investigate the piracy claims earlier. That move prompted the publishers to instead file this separate lawsuit, which also names Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and co-founder Benjamin Mann as defendants.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While Anthropic misleadingly claims to be an AI ‘safety and research’ company, its record of illegal torrenting of copyrighted works makes clear that its multibillion-dollar business empire has in fact been built on piracy,” the lawsuit says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With <a href=\"https://www.mid-day.com/tech/tech-news/article/india-crosses-1-billion-internet-users-as-satellite-internet-drives-digital-growth-23595446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than a billion internet users</a>, the country now accounts for the highest global usage of Gemini for learning, according to Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, within an education system shaped by state-level curricula, strong government involvement, and uneven access to devices and connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Phillips was speaking on the sidelines of Google’s AI for Learning Forum in New Delhi this week, where he met with industry stakeholders, including K-12 school administrators and education officials, to gather feedback on how AI tools are being used in classrooms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scale of India’s education system helps explain why the country has become such a consequential testing ground. The country’s school education system serves about 247 million students across nearly 1.47 million schools, per the Indian government’s <a href=\"https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Economic Survey 2025-26</a>, supported by 10.1 million teachers. Its higher education system is among the world’s largest as well, with <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2097864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 43 million students</a> enrolled in 2021-22 — a 26.5% increase from 2014-15 — complicating efforts to introduce AI tools across systems that are vast, decentralized, and unevenly resourced.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the clearest lessons for Google has been that AI in education cannot be rolled out as a single, centrally defined product. In India, where curriculum decisions sit at the state level and ministries play an active role, Phillips said Google has had to design its education AI so that schools and administrators — not the company — decide how and where it is used. That marks a shift for Google, which, like most Silicon Valley firms, has traditionally built products to scale globally rather than bending to the preferences of individual institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are not delivering a one-size-fits-all,” Phillips told TechCrunch. “It’s a very diverse environment around the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond governance, that diversity is also reshaping how Google thinks about AI-driven learning itself. The company is seeing faster adoption of multimodal learning in India, said Phillips, combining video, audio, and images alongside text — reflecting the need to reach students across different languages, learning styles, and levels of access, particularly in classrooms that are not built around text-heavy instruction.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-maintaining-the-teacher-student-relationship\">Maintaining the teacher-student relationship</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A related shift has been Google’s decision to design its AI for education around teachers, rather than students, as the primary point of control. The company has focused on tools that assist educators with planning, assessment, and classroom management, Phillips noted, rather than bypassing them with direct-to-student AI experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The teacher-student relationship is critical,” he said. “We’re here to help that grow and flourish, not replace it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In parts of India, AI in education is being introduced in classrooms that have never had one device per student or reliable internet access. Google is encountering schools where devices are shared, connectivity is inconsistent, or learning jumps directly from pen and paper to AI tools, Phillips said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Access is universally critical, but how and when it happens is very different,” he added, pointing to environments where schools rely on shared or teacher-led devices rather than one-to-one access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Google is translating its early learnings from India into deployments, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/google-turns-gemini-toward-indias-most-competitive-entrance-exam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-powered JEE Main preparation</a> through Gemini, a nationwide teacher training program covering 40,000 Kendriya Vidyalaya educators, and partnerships with government institutions on vocational and higher education, including India’s first AI-enabled state university.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087519\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1200,666 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1280,711 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=430,239 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=720,400 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=900,500 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=800,444 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1536,853 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=668,371 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=1111,617 1111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=708,393 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/google-gemini-jee-main.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Gemini adds JEE Main preparation for Indian Engineering aspirants</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Google, India’s experience is serving as a preview of challenges likely to surface elsewhere as AI moves deeper into public education systems. The company expects issues around control, access, and localization — now obvious in India — to increasingly shape how AI in education scales globally.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-entertainment-to-learning-as-the-top-ai-use-case\">From entertainment to learning as the top AI use case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s push also reflects a broader shift in how people are using GenAI. Entertainment had dominated AI use cases last year, said Phillips, who added that learning has now emerged as one of the most common ways people engage with the technology, particularly among younger users. As students increasingly turn to AI for studying, exam preparation, and skill-building, education has become a more immediate — and consequential — arena for Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s complex education system is also drawing increasing attention from Google’s rivals. OpenAI has begun building a local leadership presence focused on education, hiring <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/openai-announces-education-push-in-india-hires-second-india-employee/article69975697.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">former Coursera APAC managing director Raghav Gupta</a> as its India and APAC education head and <a href=\"https://openai.com/global-affairs/learning-accelerator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launching a Learning Accelerator program</a> last year. Microsoft, meanwhile, has <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/teachers-in-india-help-microsoft-research-design-ai-tool-for-creating-great-classroom-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded partnerships</a> with Indian institutions, government bodies, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/how-microsoft-planned-usd-3-billion-investment-in-india-is-playing-out-ai-upskilling-edtech-physics-wallah-ws-l-19615473.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">edtech players, including Physics Wallah</a>, to support AI-based learning and teacher training, highlighting how education is becoming a key battleground as AI companies seek to embed their tools into public systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, India’s latest Economic Survey flags risks to students from uncritical AI use, including over-reliance on automated tools and potential impacts on learning outcomes. Citing studies by MIT and Microsoft, the survey noted that “dependence on AI for creative work and writing tasks is contributing to cognitive atrophy and a deterioration of critical thinking capabilities.” This serves as a reminder that the race to enter classrooms is unfolding amid growing concerns over how AI shapes learning itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether Google’s India playbook becomes a model for AI in education elsewhere remains an open question. However, as GenAI moves deeper into public education systems, the pressures now visible in India are likely to surface in other countries as well, making the lessons Google is learning there difficult for the industry to ignore.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The founding team is impressive, and the goal — finding a less data-hungry way to train large models — is a particularly interesting one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on what I’ve seen so far, I would rate them as Level Two on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/a-new-test-for-ai-labs-are-you-even-trying-to-make-money/\">the trying-to-make-money scale</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there’s something even more exciting about the Flapping Airplanes project that I hadn’t been able to put my finger on until I read <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dcahn.substack.com/p/investing-in-flapping-airplanes\">this post from Sequoia partner David Cahn</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Cahn describes it, Flapping Airplanes is one of the first labs to move beyond scaling, the relentless buildout of data and compute that has defined most of the industry so far:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scaling paradigm argues for dedicating a huge amount of society’s resources, as much as the economy can muster, toward scaling up today’s LLMs, in the hopes that this will lead to AGI. The research paradigm argues that we are 2-3 research breakthroughs away from an “AGI” intelligence, and as a result, we should dedicate resources to long-running research, especially projects that may take 5-10 years to come to fruition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">[…]</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A compute-first approach would prioritize cluster scale above all else, and would heavily favor short-term wins (on the order of 1-2 years) over long-term bets (on the order of 5-10 years). A research-first approach would spread bets temporally, and should be willing to make lots of bets that have a low absolute probability of working, but that collectively expand the search space for what is possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It might be that the compute folks are right, and it’s pointless to focus on anything other than frenzied server buildouts. But with so many companies already pointed in that direction, it’s nice to see someone headed the other way.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Last quarter alone, the Megapack contributed $1.1 billion of the storage business’s $3.8 billion in gross profit for the entire year. Storage and energy generation revenues were up 26.5% to $12.8 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those batteries and solar panels are also very profitable, with a gross margin of 29.8%, nearly double what Tesla earns selling cars and trucks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Storage will likely play a larger role in the company’s near future, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large energy storage projects, like those installed for utilities or data centers, tend to be milestone-based, and revenue from the projects is recognized when certain milestones are achieved. In its 10-K filing with the SEC, Tesla said it expects to recognize $4.96 billion this year in deferred revenue from projects already underway. That’s more than double what the company recognized in deferred revenue from storage projects in 2025.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some hurdles lie ahead, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) phased out tax credits for residential energy storage systems like the Powerwall, though commercial tax credits for the Megapack and Megablock products will continue through the mid-2030s. Tariffs and provisions in the OBBBA also threaten to increase battery cell prices, the company said. Sales were up because volumes were up, but the average selling price of a Megapack was down, suggesting increased competition in energy storage market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet overall, Tesla remains optimistic about the storage business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Despite these challenges, as AI infrastructure drives rapid load growth, we see opportunities for our energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity,” the company said in its earnings report.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Over the past year, several U.S. phone giants, including AT&amp;T and Verizon, have confirmed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/fbi-says-chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-at-least-200-us-companies/\">persistent intrusions by China-backed hackers</a>, dubbed Salt Typhoon, seeking <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?mod=article\">phone call logs and messages</a> of senior American officials. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recent threats aside, long-known vulnerabilities in global cellular networks have allowed surveillance vendors to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/a-surveillance-vendor-was-caught-exploiting-a-new-ss7-attack-to-track-peoples-phone-locations/\">snoop on the location data of individuals</a> anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While telecom operators can determine the approximate location of a person’s phone, the person’s device itself plays a part in providing accurate location data back to the carrier, said Gary Miller, a mobile security expert who serves as a Citizen Lab researcher and senior director of network intelligence at iVerify.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most people aren’t aware that devices can send location data outside of just apps,” said Miller. “While [the devices] can limit GPS disclosure at the app level, they haven’t been able to lock down precise location disclosure to the network.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Apple’s feature, while limited to very few operator networks, is a step in the right direction in providing users with greater privacy controls,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The update comes a few months after Google Maps rolled out its Gemini-powered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/google-maps-bakes-in-gemini-to-improve-navigation-and-hands-free-use/\">hands-free, conversational driving experience</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement marks Google’s ongoing efforts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/google-previews-new-gemini-features-for-tv-at-ces-2026/\">plug Gemini into more</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/gmail-debuts-a-personalized-ai-inbox-ai-overviews-in-search-and-more/\">parts of people’s everyday lives</a>, while shifting Google Maps from static directions to real-time, conversational navigation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you’re walking around and navigating with Maps, you can now ask Gemini questions like “Tell me more about the neighborhood I’m in,” “What are some must-see attractions?” or “Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says that walking and typing can be hard, which is why it’s rolling out the ability for users to ask questions without breaking their stride or leaving Maps’ navigation screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’re cycling, you can ask Gemini questions while remaining focused on the road, Google says. You can ask questions like “What’s my ETA?” or “When’s my next meeting?” Plus, you could ask Gemini to “Text Emily I’m 10 minutes behind” so you can communicate with others while keeping your grip on the handlebars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature lets you ask multiple questions in a conversation. For example, you could ask: “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What’s parking like there?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The update is now available worldwide on iOS wherever Gemini is available, and rolling out on Android.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as Google recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/google-maps-adds-gemini-powered-tips-section-ev-charger-availability-predictions-and-more/\">updated Maps</a> with new features, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tips sections that surfaces important information places you’re interested in.

Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NHTSA has opened an <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investigation</a> into the accident, and Waymo said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/a-commitment-to-transparency-and-road-safety\">blog post</a> that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at 6 miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">probe</a> into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the National Transportation Safety Board opened its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investigation</a> last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just four years in, the cloud security startup is now worth $1.5 billion, and boasts the likes of Siemens, Peloton, Roku, Wix, Nextdoor and Nubank among its clientele. But if you ask the company’s co-founder and CEO Amiram Shachar, the journey to get here was anything but certain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Three years ago, we would spend hours asking ourselves if we were heading in the right direction, and 80% of the time, it felt like we weren’t,” a candid Shachar told TechCrunch in an interview following the startup’s recent $250 million Series B. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the beginning, we constantly questioned whether the market needed our solution, whether it would be too hard to integrate into larger systems, or if customers would adopt it,” he recalled. “Developing a new approach was difficult; people are used to installing certain agents on machines, but they don’t like doing it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwind likes to call that approach “runtime” security: Prioritizing alerts and remediation efforts around threats and vulnerabilities in active services in real time. As Shachar puts it, it’s an “inside-out” take on cloud security, where internal signals like network requests and API traffic function as context to help security teams separate urgent risks from those that can wait. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developing that approach wasn’t easy, however, as Shachar and his co-founders didn’t have a traditional background in security: they first built and sold a cloud compute brokerage called  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/06/04/netapp-spot-io-acquisition/\">Spot.io, to NetApp</a> for around $450 million in 2020. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After joining NetApp post the Spot acquisition, I experienced first-hand how difficult cloud security really is,” Shachar said. “The security team would scan our environment and report issues, but they lacked critical context. Coming from a DevOps background, we (Shachar and his team) understood the infrastructure deeply, while security teams often didn’t know how APIs were exposed or which packages were running. As a result, they flagged many issues that weren’t real risks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Shachar and his team felt they had better insight into cloud environments because they were running them. “The dominant approach was agentless, an ‘outside-in’ model where you scan environments externally,” he explained. “It’s easy to deploy, but it creates a lot of noise because you can only see what’s visible from the outside.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team realized that the context provided by internal signals would be more useful to security teams, as they’d get to see what was happening in the network, in real time. But selling their new take on cloud security proved challenging, as security teams often lack permission to deploy software internally and default to more traditional tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So Upwind sales took time. “It wasn’t clear at first, and there was a lot of uncertainty; customers were hesitant,” Shachar said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But we saw something others didn’t,” he explained. “Inside-out isn’t an advanced option; it’s the only way to solve the next generation of problems. With ephemeral infrastructure like containers, serverless workloads, AI agents talking to each other, and data constantly moving through APIs, you simply can’t map this from the outside. It has to be inside.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the company had to contend with an overcrowded security market. Security teams were already overwhelmed by the number of tools, and customers didn’t want multiple products just to manage cloud security. “From the beginning, it was clear that Upwind would need to build a broad, integrated platform,” Shachar said. “Otherwise, customers wouldn’t engage or allow us to deploy our technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s logic eventually spoke to its target customers: large, data-intensive organizations with sizable cloud footprints. Since its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/confirmed-cloud-security-specialist-upwind-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation/\">$100 million Series A in 2024</a>, Upwind has grown rapidly, posting 900% year-over-year revenue growth and doubling its customer base. The company has also expanded from its core markets in the U.S., U.K. and Israel to emerging markets including Australia, India, Singapore, and Japan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $250 million Series B was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Salesforce Ventures and Picture Capital. The fresh cash will be used for product development and go-to-market motions, and the startup plans to invest in its AI security capabilities within its core cloud security platform and “extend its approach closer to developers to help prevent misconfigurations before they reach production.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Notably, the service now receives 60,000 AI tracks per day, totaling 13.4 million AI-detected songs. By contrast, in June of last year, fully AI-generated music made up 18% of daily uploads, surpassing 20,000 tracks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Deezer claims its AI music detection tool can identify every AI-generated track from major generative models like Suno and Udio. In addition to excluding AI-generated tracks from recommendations, Deezer’s tool demonetizes them and excludes them from the royalty pool, as the company aims to fairly compensate musicians and songwriters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool’s accuracy is 99.8%, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier says there has been “great interest” in the tool, and several companies have “already performed successful tests.” One such company is Sacem, the French management company that represents over 300,000 music creators and publishers, including David Guetta and DJ Snake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The company didn’t provide pricing information or disclose which additional companies are interested in adopting the tool. A spokesperson told us that the cost varies based on the type of deal.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3087479\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Deezer-AI-DATA.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Deezer</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​There is increasing concern about AI companies using copyrighted material to train their models, as well as about methods being used to manipulate streaming systems and commit fraud. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One instance of music streaming fraud occurred in 2024, when a North Carolina musician was charged by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/north-carolina-musician-charged-music-streaming-fraud-aided-artificial-intelligence\">the Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> with creating AI-generated songs and using bots to stream them billions of times, resulting in more than $10 million in stolen streaming royalties. Additionally, AI bands like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/ai-band-the-velvet-sundown-confirm-ai-1235379354/\">The Velvet Sundown </a>have gained millions of streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/bandcamp-takes-a-stand-against-ai-music-banning-it-from-the-platform/\">​Bandcamp</a> recently got fed up and banned AI-generated music altogether, while <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/spotify-updates-ai-policy-to-label-tracks-cut-down-on-spam/\">Spotify</a> has updated its policy to address the rise of AI tracks, clarifying when AI is used in music production, reducing spam, and explicitly stating that unauthorized voice clones are prohibited on the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By contrast, major record labels have resolved lawsuits with Suno and Udio, appearing to embrace AI-generated music.

Now, in a development that seems directly related, the company has revealed that the unit lost many billions of dollars last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, Meta’s <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-302673127.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings report</a> showed that its embattled virtual reality business had lost some $19.1 billion in 2025, which is slightly more than it lost in 2024 (that year, the losses hovered around $17.7 billion). In its fourth quarter, the unit posted a loss of $6.2 billion, the report shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those losses stood against what the unit generated in sales: $955 million in Q4 and some $2.2 billion throughout 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg struck a tone of optimism for his company’s VR team while noting that losses in 2026 are expected to be very much the same.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,” Zuckerberg said, during the call. However, the CEO noted that losses were expected to continue. “I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year,” Zuckerberg said, while noting that this year would “likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Meta announced a pivot toward the “metaverse” in 2021, the move was regarded with a certain amount of skepticism and, during its first year of VR efforts, the company <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/10/07/metas-horizon-world-quality-poor-not-even-employees-using-says-metaverse-vp-leaked-memo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">faced harsh criticism</a> — even being referred to as an “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/08/18/mark-zuckerberg-mocked-metaverse-selfie-10-billion-reality-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">international laughingstock</a>.” Nearly half a decade later, that skepticism <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/well-there-goes-the-metaverse/\">hasn’t exactly subsided</a>. As the VR business continues to lose money and Meta continues an aggressive pivot away from VR and toward AI, it’s unclear what exactly will turn the ailing business around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/13/meta-lays-off-vr-employees-underscoring-zuckerbergs-pivot-to-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a>, in addition to the layoffs, Meta had plans to shutter a number of its VR studios — another sign that the company’s interest in virtual reality is waning. The company also recently announced that it would be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-closing-down-its-vr-meeting-rooms-as-part-of-its-wider-cull-140000422.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">retiring its standalone Workrooms app</a> — which the company had pitched to office workers as a VR space that could be used to hold meetings.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Both <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/google-launches-new-protocol-for-agent-driven-purchases/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">OpenAI</a> have built platforms for agent-enabled transactions, with companies like Stripe and Uber signed on as partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while other AI labs have already built significant technical infrastructure, Meta believes its access to personal data will prove uniquely valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content and our relationships,” Zuckerberg said on the call. “A lot of what makes agents valuable is the unique context that they can see, and we believe that Meta will be able to provide a uniquely personal experience.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/manus-joins-meta-accelerating-ai-innovation-for-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In December</a>, Meta acquired the general-purpose agent developer Manus, which provides similar technology. At the time, Meta said it would “continue to operate and sell the Manus service, as well as integrate it into our products.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investor call was timed to the release of <a href=\"https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2026/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Meta’s most recent quarterly earnings</a>, which also disclosed a significant increase in new infrastructure spending. The company now anticipates that it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion on overall capital expenditures over the course of 2026, up from $72 billion in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its official filing, Meta attributed the jump to “increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While significant, the figure still falls short of the projected $600 billion that Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly projected</a> for Meta’s infrastructure spending through 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has previously drawn criticism from investors for failing to clearly state how its massive AI investment will translate to the company’s bottom line. But while details are still thin, Zuckerberg made it clear that the AI lab’s work would reach the public soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is going to be a big year for delivering personal superintelligence, accelerating our business, building infrastructure for the future, and shaping how our company will work going forward,” he told investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Those obligations leaped to $625 billion from $392 billion in the previous quarter.

Once production ends, Tesla will build Optimus robots in the same factory space, according to Musk. Production of Tesla’s Cybertruck, which is made at the company’s factory outside of Austin, will continue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-motors-delivers-worlds-first-premium-electric-sedan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched</a> the Model S in 2012, and it’s regarded as the first car that made electric vehicles widely appealing. The Model X was Tesla’s second major electric vehicle program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla always intended for its more affordable models — the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV — to greatly outsell their predecessors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But sales of both models have flatlined in recent years, despite interior and exterior refreshes along the way. Tesla has faced increased competition in the luxury EV space from legacy automakers, as well as upstarts like Rivian and Lucid Motors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So that is slightly sad, but it’s… it is time to bring the S and X programs to an end,” Musk said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tesla-s-first-ground-up-design\">Tesla’s first ground-up design</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model S was not Tesla’s first car — that title goes to the original Roadster. But the Model S was the first car Tesla created from the ground up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That helped it ditch a lot of the tradeoffs of the Roadster, and paved the way for the Model S to become one of the first true mass-market electric vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla launched the sedan in 2012 with a base price of $57,400. It had a floor-mounted battery that helped make it roomier and far more dynamic to drive than the few other all-electric vehicles that were available at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla also offered the Model S with multiple battery sizes, allowing customers to pay up for more EV range. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The car was instantly popular, with Tesla collecting more than 10,000 reservations for it by the time the first deliveries started in June of that year. By 2013, it had become MotorTrend’s <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/2013-motor-trend-car-of-the-year-tesla-model-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">car of the year</a>, beating out the best gas cars from around the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At its core, the Tesla Model S is simply a damned good car you happen to plug in to refuel,” MotorTrend wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla iterated on the Model S in the years that followed. It changed up battery options — at one point even offering larger battery packs with range that was software-limited, in a bid to get customers to adopt a sort of “buy now pay later” attitude. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model S was also the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/17/teslas-model-s-gets-ludicrous-mode-will-do-0-60-in-2-8-seconds/\">first Tesla</a> to get “Ludicrous Mode,” which made it possible to go from 0 to 60 m.p.h in just 2.8 seconds. It was an exhilarating feature that also became one of Tesla’s sharpest word-of-mouth marketing tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla kept improving the Model S, giving it industry-leading range that still beats most other EVs and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh\">an overall exterior and interior refresh</a> in 2021. But by that point the company’s success had skyrocketed on the backs of the much cheaper Model 3 and Model Y. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-faberge-suv\">The Fabergé SUV</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model X was not so straightforward. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/10/tesla-model-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">teased</a> before the release of the Model S in 2012, the Model X SUV didn’t hit the streets until 2015. When it did, it arrived with overly complex “Falcon Wing” rear doors that folded up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These made it extremely easy to get in and out of the Model X. But the doors — along with the rest of the SUV — proved to be very hard to build at scale with any reliable quality over the years. Musk eventually <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/elon-musk-model-s-model-x-production-continues-for-sentimental-reasons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">called</a> it the “Fabergé of cars.” It was a nod to the luxury stylings and features, but also to the Model X’s brittle nature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model X still sold fairly well alongside the S, and it also received a big refresh in 2021. But production problems plagued the new version, too, and Musk admitted in early 2022 that Tesla made a mistake by halting production before the redesigned Model X was <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2022/02/10/tesla-delays-model-x-deliveries-elon-musk-admits-problems-production-ramp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ready to be made at scale</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-long-time-coming\">A long time coming</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In hindsight, the retirement of the Model S and Model X have been a long time coming. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk himself <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/elon-musk-model-s-model-x-production-continues-for-sentimental-reasons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a> in 2019 that Tesla was still making these “niche” vehicles more for “sentimental reasons than anything else.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They are really of minor importance to our future,” Musk said at the time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that point, Tesla was still selling tens of thousands of Model S and Model X SUVs per quarter. But the company’s first truly new model was on the horizon: the Cybertruck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revealed in 2019, Tesla had big plans for the Cybertruck. The company stated it would sell a base version for $40,000, and make 250,000 of them a year. Delays brought on by the Covid pandemic, along with the vehicle’s complex new design, meant the vehicle hit the market far later than anticipated.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once it did hit the road, the Cybertruck bombed — although Tesla continues to publicly support it, including during Wednesday’s earnings call. A supposed backlog of 2 million orders never materialized, and neither did the $40,000 base price. Tesla has struggled to sell just a few thousand of them per quarter ever since.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Cybertruck’s failure likely gave the Model S and Model X some cover. Not only did the two legacy EVs help <em>slightly </em>offset the garish truck’s terrible popularity, Tesla also bucketed the three vehicles as “other models” when reporting quarterly sales figures, making it hard to say just how badly the Cybertruck was doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Tesla is now a company aimed at solving autonomy in cars, and in robots, according to Musk. That’s apparently what ultimately did in the Model S and Model X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They may have been of “minor importance” to [Tesla’s] future seven years ago. But they will always be crucial to the company’s early years, and the construction of Musk as an uber-rich businessman who now looms over modern society.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now we know Tesla is among its investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla disclosed in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">letter to shareholders</a> on Wednesday that it invested $2 billion in xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot that also owns <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Musk’s social media company X</a>. Other <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/series-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously disclosed</a> investors in xAI include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, as well as Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a truly circular deal and one that Tesla shareholders voted against last year. In November, shareholders were asked in a nonbinding measure to allow the Tesla board to authorize an investment in xAI. About 1.06 billion votes were in favor, and 916.3 million opposed, per <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-07/tesla-shareholders-didn-t-approve-authorizing-investment-in-xai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg’s reporting</a> at the time. While that would seem like an approval, the number of abstentions — which count as votes against in Tesla’s bylaws — meant the measure was rejected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla proceeded anyway and offered up an argument, in its shareholder letter and during its earnings call, in support of the investment. Tesla’s justification appears to be tied to xAI’s alignment with its most recent master plan — and how these companies are about to get a lot closer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As set forth in Master Plan Part IV, Tesla is building products and services that bring AI into the physical world. Meanwhile, xAI is developing leading digital AI products and services, such as its large language model (Grok),” the shareholder letter reads. “In that context, and as part of Tesla’s broader strategy under Master Plan Part IV, Tesla and xAI also entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla said the agreement builds upon an existing relationship with xAI by “providing a framework for evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla already supplies its Megapack batteries to power xAI data centers, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1924684815548207566\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed last year</a>, and the company <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/support/grok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has included</a> the xAI chatbot Grok into some of its vehicles.

Because this is part of the strategic initiative.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its letter to shareholders, Tesla highlighted these and other developments in physical AI and robotics, including plans for developing its Optimus robot, semitrucks, and other autonomous capabilities. The company broadly beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue, but profit <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fell 46% last year</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Together, the investment and the related framework agreement are intended to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale,” Tesla said in the shareholder letter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investment is expected to close in the first quarter. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk and Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja signaled during the company’s earnings call it expect other capital expenditures that support its mission. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This year for Tesla is the first major steps as we increase vehicle autonomy and begin to produce Optimus robots at scale — we’re making very, very big investments,” Musk said on the call. “So this is going to be a very big capex here; that is deliberate, because we’re making big investments for an epic future.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the company has not clarified how it will make this determination, or whether it includes images that have been edited using traditional tools, like Adobe’s Photoshop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, the only details on the new feature come from a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2016387626257813518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cryptic X post from Elon Musk</a> saying, “Edited visuals warning,” as he reshares an announcement of a new X feature made by the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/16i4s5d/using_investigative_journalism_to_answer_the/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">anonymous</a> X account <a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/2016385433849221135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DogeDesigner</a>. That account is often used as a proxy for introducing new X features, as Musk will repost from it to share news.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, details on the new system are thin. DogeDesigner’s post claimed X’s new feature could make it “harder for legacy media groups to spread misleading clips or pictures.” It also claimed the feature is new to X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before it was acquired and renamed as X, the company known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/twitters-policy-on-deepfakes-and-manipulated-media-will-only-remove-harmful-tweets-including-voter-suppression/\">Twitter had labeled tweets</a> using manipulated, deceptively altered, or fabricated media as an alternative to removing them. Its policy wasn’t limited to AI but included things like “selected editing or cropping or slowing down or overdubbing, or manipulation of subtitles,” the site integrity head, Yoel Roth, said in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear if X is adopting the same rules or has made any significant changes to tackle AI. Its help <a href=\"https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/authenticity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">documentation</a> currently says there’s a policy against sharing inauthentic media, but it’s rarely enforced, as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">recent deepfake debacle</a> of users sharing non-consensual nude images showed.

In addition, users should know whether or not there’s any sort of dispute process beyond X’s crowdsourced Community Notes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Meta discovered when it introduced AI image labeling in 2024, it’s easy for detection systems to go awry. In its case, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/meta-tagging-real-photos-made-with-ai/\">Meta was found to be incorrectly tagging</a> real photographs with its “Made with AI” label, even though they had not been created using generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This happened because AI features are increasingly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/adobe-brings-firefly-ai-powered-generative-remove-to-lightroom/\">being integrated</a> into creative tools used by photographers and graphic artists. (Apple’s new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/with-apples-new-creator-studio-pro-ai-is-a-tool-to-aid-creation-not-replace-it/\">Creator Studio suite, launching today</a>, is one recent example.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it turned out, this confused Meta’s identification tools. For instance, Adobe’s cropping tool was flattening images before saving them as a JPEG, triggering Meta’s AI detector. <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2024/05/28/instagram-photos-are-being-labeled-made-with-ai-when-theyre-not/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In another example,</a> Adobe’s Generative AI Fill, which is used to remove objects — like wrinkles in a shirt, or an unwanted reflection — was also causing images to be labeled as “Made with AI,” when they were only edited with AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/01/meta-changes-its-label-from-made-with-ai-to-ai-info-to-indicate-use-of-ai-in-photos/\">Meta updated its label to say “AI info,</a>” so as not to outright label images as “Made with AI” when they had not been. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, there’s a standards-setting body for verifying the authenticity and content provenance for digital content, known as the <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">C2PA</a> (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity). There are also related initiatives like <a href=\"https://contentauthenticity.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CAI</a>, or Content Authenticity Initiative, and <a href=\"https://iptc.org/media-provenance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Project Origin</a>, focused on adding tamper-evident provenance metadata to media content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presumably, X’s implementation would abide by some sort of known process for identifying AI content, but X’s owner, Elon Musk, didn’t say what that is. Nor did he clarify whether he’s talking specifically about AI images, or just anything that’s not the photo being uploaded to X directly from your smartphone’s camera. It’s even unclear whether the feature is brand-new, as DogeDesigner claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X isn’t the only outlet grappling with manipulated media. In addition to Meta, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/tiktok-now-lets-you-choose-how-much-ai-generated-content-you-want-to-see/\">TikTok</a> has also been labeling AI content. Streaming services like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/deezer-starts-labeling-ai-generated-music-to-tackle-streaming-fraud/\">Deezer</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/spotify-updates-ai-policy-to-label-tracks-cut-down-on-spam/\">Spotify</a> are also scaling initiatives to identify and label AI music, as well. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/16496549?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google Photos is using C2PA</a> to indicate how photos on its platform were made. Microsoft, the BBC, Adobe, Arm, Intel, Sony, OpenAI, and others are on <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/membership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the C2PA’s steering committee</a>, while many more companies have joined as members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X is not currently listed among the <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/membership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">members</a>, though we’ve reached out to C2PA to see if that recently changed. X doesn’t typically respond to requests for comment, but we asked anyway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
