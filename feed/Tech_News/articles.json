The electric bike company filed for <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/rad-power-bikes-files-for-bankruptcy-and-is-looking-to-sell-the-business/\">Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a>, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding. A spokesperson told TechCrunch the company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then there is troubled lidar maker <strong>Luminar</strong>, which also <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\">filed for bankruptcy</a> this week. The Luminar bankruptcy does not seem like a let’s-help-it-live-another-day type of situation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Luminar filing, which occurred after months of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/luminar-is-cutting-jobs-losing-its-cfo-and-warning-of-a-cash-shortage/\">layoffs</a>, executive departures, and a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/luminar-is-fighting-with-its-biggest-customer-as-bankruptcy-threat-looms/\">legal fight</a> with its largest customer, Volvo, notes the company plans to sell off the business. It has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it’s completed, senior reporter <strong>Sean O’Kane</strong> reported. Want to learn more? I recommend reading O’Kane’s piece that looks at how <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\">Luminar’s doomed Volvo deal helped drag the company into bankruptcy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though the year was bookended by some failures, that doesn’t mean 2025 wasn’t filled with innovation and growth. The emerging robotaxi industry has indeed <em>emerged</em>. With that I have noticed new kinds of autonomous vehicle-adjacent companies popping up, and I expect that to become a trend in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scale of robotaxis was largely driven by <strong>Waymo’s</strong> fast-paced growth, although <strong>Zoox</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong> have also started to set up shop. This next year could be when we see these companies really squaring off in the same markets; it will also be the year when companies will face even greater scrutiny over safety and how robotaxis fit into daily life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, EVs have had their struggles this year and automakers have struggled to adjust.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, <strong>Ford</strong> is pivoting yet again. The company said this week it is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/fords-next-f-150-lightning-will-have-a-gas-generator-as-it-pivots-away-from-large-evs/\">ending production</a> of the fully-electric F-150 Lightning as part of a broader companywide shake-up that will put more emphasis on hybrids and gas-powered vehicles. As part of its shift, Ford is turning to the increasingly popular “extended range electric vehicle” version of the truck, which adds a gas generator that can recharge the battery pack to power the motors for over 700 miles. It’s also getting into the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/ford-is-starting-a-battery-storage-business-to-power-data-centers-and-the-grid/\">energy storage business</a> — gotta do something with all those batteries — and says it is still committed to producing a midsized electric truck that will go on sale in 2027. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But hey, the EV is not dead. And the promise of smaller, more affordable ones are looming in the near distance with the imminent launch of <strong>Rivian’s</strong> R2 and <strong>Slate Auto’s</strong> electric truck. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Housekeeping note</strong>: This is the last newsletter of the year.

The robotaxi service is limited with a fleet size numbering in the dozens. Still, it is a milestone. And for those wondering, the California Department of Motor Vehicles told me this week that Tesla has not applied for a driverless testing permit. The company only holds a permit to test autonomous vehicle technology with a human safety operator located behind the wheel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Tesla is facing a tricky situation in California. Here’s the gist: An administrative law judge agreed with the case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and ruled Tesla <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-marketing-for-autopilot-and-full-self-driving-judge-rules/\">engaged in deceptive marketing</a> that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver-assistance software. The DMV wanted to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its action, and a judge has agreed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ah, but wait. The DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to comply. That gives Tesla two options if it wants to keep those licenses: drop the Autopilot name or ship software to its cars that make them autonomous.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-one-more-thing\">One more thing …</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of you might not know that I am also co-host of <strong>Equity</strong>, a TechCrunch’s podcast about the business of startups.

Spokesperson Suzanne Philion provided a similar statement to TechCrunch on Sunday morning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage,” Philion said. “Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials to monitor infrastructure stability, and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon. We appreciate your patience and will provide further updates as soon as they are available.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company did not provide an explanation for why the blackout had such a dramatic effect on its vehicles. One possible culprit: The blackout took down many of the city’s traffic lights. (In fact, with the blackout affecting both lights and Muni mass transit, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=849547921115149\">warned residents to stay off the roads</a> unless they needed to travel.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others theorized that Waymo might have been affected by an interruption in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/OkGoDoIt/status/2002548692386189765\">cell service</a> or <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/12/20/waymo-sf-blackout-robotaxi-traffic-jams/\">traffic data</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The blackout appears to have been caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric substation in the city. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/san-francisco-power-pge-outage-21255221.php\">SFGate reports</a> that around 120,000 PG&amp;E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pgealerts.alerts.pge.com/outage-tools/outage-map/\">PG&amp;E’s website</a> also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/investor-letter-reveals-skyrocketing-growth-of-waymos-robotaxi-rides/\">A letter from Tiger Global Management</a> that leaked earlier this month said Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week, nearly double the amount that the Alphabet-owned company disclosed in the spring.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate. This change is part of a broader ‘<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_3051\">Automotive Package</a>‘ designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“China already dominates EV manufacturing,” said Craig Douglas, a partner at World Fund, a European climate-focused venture capital firm. “If Europe doesn’t compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Douglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Senior executives from companies including Cabify, EDF, Einride, Iberdrola, and numerous EV-related startups signed the letter, exhorting the Commission to “stand firm” on the original 2035 zero-emission target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their appeal wasn’t enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. But continuing pressure has sparked debate within the startup community and beyond about the best path for Europe if it’s to remain competitive during the energy transition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Industry split on timeline</strong></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even within the auto industry, opinions differ. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for many years to come.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike Mercedes-Benz and other manufacturers, the Swedish carmaker had no concerns about meeting the 2035 ban. Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Issam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. “History shows that this kind of flexibility has never worked out well,” said Tidjani, who also signed the Take Charge Europe letter this fall. “It delays scale, weakens learning curves, and ultimately costs industrial leadership rather than preserving it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be fair, the Commission hasn’t completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The company, hoping to succeed where Swedish battery maker Northvolt struggled, opened its first large-scale battery factory in Northern France this week. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe’s battery industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Mixed signals</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU’s commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Already, traditional carmakers have begun complaining that the carbon offset requirements could make cars more expensive for consumers, potentially undermining the very competitiveness the policy change was meant to protect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another uncertainty involves the United Kingdom. It’s unclear whether the U.K. will follow the EU’s lead and modify its own 2035 combustion engine ban. Unlike both the European Union and the United States, the U.K. hasn’t yet imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, despite that their rapidly increasing sales in the British market have raised concerns among domestic manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The debate highlights ongoing tensions in climate policy between how to balance the economic realities facing existing industries with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner tech. As Europe tries to thread this needle, the decisions made now will invariably impact whether the continent leads or lags in the global EV market.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Years ago, when venture capitalist Jon Medved took an interest in backing various health tech startups, he had no idea that one day, he would need them to improve his own quality of life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Israel tight-knit startup community received a blow in October when Medved, one of its most famous VCs, announced he was retiring immediately. He was forced to step down from the firm he founded, OurCrowd, after he was diagnosed with the debilitating disease of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS,) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This has come rather sudden,” he told TechCrunch in an audibly hoarse voice — a symptom of ALS — on what could be his last interview. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I had been feeling a little weird before and they didn’t know what was ailing me,” he explained. “I was in the hospital for several weeks recovering, and that’s when they tested me and said, ‘You’ve got ALS,’ which is a horrible disease, the worst you can imagine.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ALS is a condition that degrades the brain’s motor neurons, leading to loss of muscle control, eventually impairing walking, talking, eating, and breathing. He didn’t have the classic symptoms, as his voice was attacked first, not his extremities, he said. But he knows that the condition will worsen, and there is no cure, only therapies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Medved is considered one of the fathers of Israel’s startup ecosystem — often called “Startup Nation” after the decades-old <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Start-up-Nation-Israels-Economic-Miracle-ebook/dp/B004QZ9P6K/\">best-selling book</a> of the same name. He helped usher it in, having moved from California to Israel in his 20s, then founding and selling several tech companies before turning to investing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2013, he founded OurCrowd. While Israel has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://visible.vc/blog/venture-capital-in-israel/\">many powerful home-grown VC firms</a>, as well as branches of global firms like Bessemer, OurCrowd essentially invented crowdsourced venture capital, where a limited partnership was open to any <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/learn/what-is-an-accredited-investor\">accredited investor.</a> </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s roster attracted LPs from Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America, growing a network of 240,000 accredited investor LPs in 195 countries, the firm says. Many of them are doctors, lawyers, and ordinary people who not only help their investment companies, but would have otherwise been cut out of the wealth generation that VCs experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OurCrowd has backed names like Anthropic, Beyond Meat and Lemonade. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Medved describes OurCrowd as now a “significant player” backing about 500 portfolio companies with about 74 exits, including an exit a couple of weeks ago when its infrastructure planning startup Locusview sold for $525 million <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.locusview.com/resources/locusview-to-be-acquired-by-itron-accelerating-digital-construction-management-for-utilities\">to Itron.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite Israel’s conflict with Gaza, which has impacted its citizens and put the nation in global crosshairs over the Palestinian humanitarian crisis, its startup ecosystem has remained strong.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the “startup nation,” Israel remains a key player for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-latest-military-tech-tested-in-gaza-wanted-by-the-west-3d9add02\">cybersecurity and defense tech</a> as well as AI, microchips, enterprise software, food tech, health tech — the whole tech stack. For example, in November, there was “$800 million invested in the Israeli venture ecosystem in one week,” Medved said. The country now has nearly 100 unicorns and over the year, he estimates that between $15 billion and $16 billion was invested in the country in venture deals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the tech of some of these startups will help him navigate life with an incurable condition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, he’s had an avatar made of himself that preserves his voice, face and mannerisms. (The photo/video realistic digital twin is pictured and the full video <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFQdTy0ohss\">can be seen here</a>.) OurCrowd AI portfolio company D-ID, maker of agents and avatars, partnered with voice <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/elevenlabs-just-hit-a-6-6b-valuation-its-ceo-says-the-real-money-isnt-in-voice-anymore/\">AI startup ElevenLabs</a> and other companies through the ALS-focused <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.scottmorganfoundation.org/\">Scott-Morgan Foundation</a> to create an avatar system designed for people with ALS.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He just experienced this tech during a Zoom call with another person who has ALS who was using the avatar to communicate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So this stuff has become very, very personal to me,” Medved said. “It will preserve my voice when it goes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he said there will be a variety of startups tech he will lean on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve made 60, 70 healthcare investments in good companies that help people. We’ve got a company called OncoHost, which uses AI to help select what kind of immunotherapy will actually work for you …  We have companies doing next-generation sequencing for the genome. We have companies doing chronic condition management,” he catalogs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I tell you now as a once-healthy person [who took health for granted] I felt human pain and disease, but once you are actually engaged in one of these nasty diseases, it changes your perspective,” Medved shared.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this means that, even though he’s given up his position running the company and may be retiring from the public eye, “I’m far from over, ok? I want to continue to contribute, both to OurCrowd and the overall ecosystem. So I fully intend to not go off [quietly] into this good night.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And in the end, he says “I’m very proud that in a small way, even though all we are is investors, to be part of this movement.” <br><br>A video featuring Medved’s “digital twin” demonstrates just how realistic his avatar already is.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jon Medved OurCrowd Avatar\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFQdTy0ohss?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Roomba maker, which had sold over 50 million robots since its 2002 launch, had survived 35 years of near-death experiences and technical challenges only to be undone by what founder Colin Angle calls “avoidable” regulatory opposition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The collapse followed Amazon’s January 2024 decision to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-irobot-scrap-acquisition-deal-7072122f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfql3LJk9Osar827PELG38TCJJbE95-p1TzzLtBDgqJS6dhOh_JQfR1L4xplW0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693f68b4&amp;gaa_sig=7DEtWR6zUVdLHZ4Tth-Tie0umvKh-jgAtvdhEmOHhkT_FrXMJOg5o2EKWOPSzqqdOuIFBXHvI82JOSpTXJscJw%3D%3D\">scuttle</a> its $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot after 18 months of investigation by the FTC and European regulators. In this candid conversation, Angle reflects on what he describes as a profoundly frustrating process, the chilling message it sends to entrepreneurs, and his determination to move forward with a new venture in consumer robotics. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>TC: You called the bankruptcy “avoidable” and a “tragedy for consumers.” Walk me through what you think regulators got wrong in blocking the Amazon acquisition.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CA: I think there’s a real lesson around the role of the FTC and the European Commission. The goal, of course, is to avoid the abuses that can happen in monopolies and with the goal of protecting consumer choice and protecting innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot’s trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier. In the EU, we had a 12% market share [but it was] declining where the number one competitor was only three years old in the market, which is nearly the definition of a vibrant and dynamic marketplace. And in the United States, iRobot’s market share was higher, but it was declining and there were multiple growing competitors bringing outside innovation into the marketplace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This should have been a no-brainer. This should have been three, four weeks of investigation. What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What was that 18-month process actually like? What were you being asked to do?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The amount of money and time spent was indescribable. I would not be surprised if over 100,000 documents were created and delivered. iRobot invested a significant part of our discretionary earnings against fulfilling the requirements that went along with doing the transaction. Amazon was forced to invest many, many, many times that. There was a whole team, both internal and external employees and lawyers and economists working to try to, in as many different ways as possible — because it seemed like our message was falling on deaf ears — demonstrate that this acquisition was not going to create a monopolistic situation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There was daily activity for 18 months associated with this. Perhaps most telling, when I was testifying as part of being deposed, I had a chance to walk the halls of the FTC. The examiners on their office doors had printouts of deals blocked, like trophies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Trophies?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To me, it felt so wrong as an entrepreneur who started this thing literally in my living room and lived six and a half years never having enough money in the bank to make payroll, finally making it through succeeding. Here’s an agency whose stated mission is protecting consumer interests and helping the United States economy, celebrating as victories every time they shut down M&amp;A, which in a very real way is the primary driver of value creation for the innovation economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I went into this deposition looking for a friend. It’s like, “Here we are, we’re obviously not in a stronger place, and here’s a great opportunity for us. Are you excited for us?” Maybe this is just my naïve take coming out, but that’s not the reception I got. It was, “Why should we ever let them do this?” It’s like: because it’s good for the consumer — because it’s going to catalyze innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>How do you think what happened here changes the calculus for startup founders who see acquisition as their exit strategy? Do you think we’re in a world where American tech companies can’t scale through M&amp;A?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Risk has a chilling effect. If you’re an entrepreneur, your only option is to hope that it doesn’t happen again. The reason you and I are talking is I hope by my words I can make it less likely that it will happen again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I founded a new company and my outlook on exit strategy and even commercialization strategy is impacted by the experiences I had at iRobot. How can it not be? That precedent creates risk of it happening again, and only through positive experiences do we start to dial down the anxiety that the exits I’m depending on — or as a venture capitalist, the exits I’m investing in assuming will happen — will actually come through. That risk is factored into the willingness to invest, the valuation of deals, and the rate of new company formation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to say there’s X percent fewer entrepreneurial starts or exits as a result of the chilling message, but it certainly didn’t help. Entrepreneurs can use every leg up that we as a nation can provide. It is a rugged journey. When it actually works out, it should be a celebration. The FTC is there as a safeguard against very real examples of things gone too far. I’m a big believer in checks and balances. But when things get out of whack, the country suffers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Let’s talk about iRobot’s journey. The Roomba didn’t come out for 12 years after the company was founded. Tell me about those early days.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">iRobot was a bunch of people in an academic lab saying, “We were promised robots. Where are the robots?” If I could be pissed off that I don’t have the robots we were promised, I should do something about it. If not us, who? If not now, when?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the co-founders, my professor Rod Brooks, had pioneered an AI technology which allowed the embedding of machine intelligence in low-cost robotics. The mission of the company was to build cool stuff, deliver a great product, have fun, make money, and change the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first business plan was “private mission to the moon, sell the movie rights.” We were maybe the first company to fail to do exactly that. But the technology we developed led to additions to the Mars Pathfinder mission — my name’s up on Mars. We built robots that went into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. We built the PackBot, which was the first robot ever deployed in a combat mission for the US Army, went into caves in Afghanistan, and became the primary methodology for diffusing improvised explosive devices. We would get postcards: “You saved my life today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the Fukushima disaster happened, we donated half a million dollars worth of robots to Japan. We sent six people over to train Tokyo Electric Power Company employees. Those robots were the first inside the reactor doors, mapped out radiation levels, and found a path where an employee could run in, get to the control room, work for a minute and a half, run back out, and only receive a lifetime dose of radiation. We were credited with enabling the shutdown of the reactor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>And then year 12, the Roomba?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I had a team that was working on toys, and one of the guys said, “Colin, I think it’s time we can do this. We can finally make the vacuum.” I’m like, “Okay, here’s $15,000. Two weeks. See what you can do.” Two weeks later they came back and said, “Hey, that’s not bad. Maybe there’s something here.” We scraped and found a little bit of money [to build these]. A year and a half later, I convinced my board that we could build 10,000 of these robots and we launched them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s really the media that picked up the story. We had no money for marketing. Reporters were fascinated because we tended to do interesting things that were real, and they couldn’t believe that robot vacuuming could possibly be real. [The reaction was:] “My God, it actually worked.” We ended up selling 70,000 robots in the first three months. Then we nearly went out of business the next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Because you couldn’t accommodate demand?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because we screwed up. The press drove this huge initial demand — 70,000 robots. So next year we’re going to do four times that. We made 300,000 robots. We even made a television commercial, but we were a bunch of geek engineers, so it totally failed. After Cyber Monday we were sitting with 250,000 robots in our warehouse like, “Oh my God, the world’s going to end.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then something good happened. The guy running our website said, “Why did sales quadruple yesterday?” We hadn’t done anything. What had happened was Pepsi had started running a TV ad with Dave Chappelle. He walks into this beautiful home, picks up a potato chip, and a Roomba comes out. He’s like, “A vacuum cleaner!” He throws down the potato chip, the vacuum eats it, then chases him. His pants are ripped off. He stands up in boxers. A beautiful woman appears, and he says, “Your vacuum cleaner ate my pants.” We sold 250,000 robots in two weeks and realized we knew nothing about marketing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Wow! You had no idea Pepsi was incorporating your product into its commercial?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No idea. It was wild. You try to do good for so long and you get smacked in the face so many times, and then sometimes something good happens. You could say because of that crazy moment in time, we have robots. When we think about just how fragile a journey it is — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt5rBfNucc\">cats riding Roombas</a> was a big part of why we succeeded. Does that make any sense? No, not at all. But we certainly didn’t expect tens of billions of views of cats riding Roombas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>At some point you started seeing Chinese competitors like Roborock and Ecovacs adopting lidar navigation years before iRobot. Why did you stick with vision-based navigation for so long?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We explicitly did not put lasers on the robot. We had the technology decades ago because it’s a dead-end technology. Under my strategic direction, we were going to invest every penny of cost against a vision-based nav and situational understanding system. Your Tesla does not have a laser on it. It is all vision-based. At least Elon agrees with me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Our strategic plan was for Roomba to be much more than just a vacuum cleaner in the home. To do that, it needs to understand more. Lasers are not advanced technology — they’ve been around for decades. They’re an expedient solution to a subset of the problems that a robot at home needs to take on. A laser will never tell you whether you actually cleaned the floor or not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is absolutely true that Chinese competition was coming in at lower price points. We were late in building a two-in-one robot — we believed that by separating mopping and vacuuming you could give a better customer experience. The customer voted that we were wrong, and that’s okay. We certainly were first in auto-evac, first in navigation. We were also importantly excluded from the Chinese marketplace, which is the largest market for consumer robotics in the world. That didn’t help.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What learnings from your iRobot experience would you share with other robotics entrepreneurs?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first thing I tell all robotics entrepreneurs is: make sure you understand your market so that you are building something that delivers more value than it costs to create. Robots are so exciting, so sexy that it’s really easy to convince yourself that you’re doing something that is going to change the world, if only consumers were smart enough to realize it. That’s a pretty tough equation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Technology is oftentimes in the robot space well ahead of the business plans that can take advantage of the technology. One of the traps is thinking of robotics as a thing as opposed to a toolkit. As soon as you say, “I’m going to build a robot,” and head off building your humanoid — are you really doing it because you understand a problem you’re trying to solve, or are you enamored with building your thing?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I started iRobot, it was just assumed that robots were going to vacuum floors by building humanoids to push upright vacuum cleaners. When we first built Roomba, we would ask people, “Is that a robot?” People would say, “No, that’s not a robot. A robot has arms and legs and a head.” Yet Roomba at the time cost 10,000 times less than a humanoid pushing an upright vacuum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The challenge of entrepreneurship is breaking through the romance and opportunity and falling in love with your technology and getting to the application that you’re trying to solve. Understand your consumer, understand the problem you’re trying to solve — because it’s complicated, robotics is expensive, and it takes a lot of energy to get right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>You mentioned you’ve founded a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.familiarmachines.com/\">new company</a>. What can you tell me about it?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re in stealth mode, but I’ll give you a broad hint. It’s consumer-facing. We’re really looking at the fact that most of the things robots can do to meet outstanding needs require us to interact with other people. So how do we build a robot that actually has sufficient emotional sophistication — not human-level, but enough — to build an enduring co-character that can make sense over time and use that for health and wellness related applications?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s going to be awesome. I’m so excited about it. It’s given me enthusiasm and energy to have a chance to use this new toolkit and continue on my journey to build the robots we were promised. I really haven’t changed that much from a grad student in college saying, “Oh my God, we’ve been promised robots and we don’t have the ones that I want yet.” I spent 30 years focused on building the world’s greatest floor care robot, and now I have a chance to do something else.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>For more from this interview with Angle, including his take on whether humanoid robots will ever work, check out TechCrunch’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/76SeToo8Rxj8hRTE0iQwWZ\">StrictlyVC Download</a> podcast — new episodes drop every Tuesday, and the full conversation will be available soon</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Brown officials said they removed the student’s digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast Company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91463942/sequoia-shaun-maguire-brown-university-shooter-palestine\">republished</a> two of Maguire’s deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/shaunmmaguire/status/2001043856071254339\">comments</a> he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shaunmaguire.fyi/\">open letter</a> urging Sequoia to take action.

Chief Operating Officer Sumaiya Balbale <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e6de299-3eb6-4ba9-8037-266c55c02170\">left the firm</a> in August over Sequoia’s inaction on Maguire’s anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times.

He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire’s outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs?

As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly.

And this week on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/build-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Build Mode</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Startup Battlefield</a> editor Isabelle Johannessen spoke to two founders who are working to make progress  in industries ripe for disruption, despite the regulatory headaches that might have deterred many other people.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this episode, we’re talking about life and death and how regulatory clearance doesn’t have to be a damper on innovation but it will elongate timelines and require careful planning from the jump.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Isabelle is first joined by Gabriel Sanchez, the CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.enspectrahealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Enspectra Health</a>. The company has built a device that aims to do away with the need for dermatologist skin biopsies. Sanchez breaks down his decade-long journey to receiving FDA clearance. Throughout the interview, Sanchez offers tactical advice to anyone in the midst of a long regulatory process and explains how he’s kept his company afloat and his team motivated despite the uncertainties.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next, Isabelle speaks with Tom Harries, the co-founder of <a href=\"https://earthfuneral.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Earth Funeral</a>, an end-of-life startup that has developed a new process that transforms human remains into soil. Harries didn’t have to lead his team through a long FDA approval process (because the FDA is primarily concerned with the living), but his company has faced its own legislative challenges. Earth Funeral launched at a time when its alternative process was only legal in one state. And though its path to expansion doesn’t hinge on accreditation or approval from a government agency, it does depend on legislative bodies and voters who may be discomforted by a new way to lay a loved one to rest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>New episodes of Build Mode drop every Thursday. </em><a href=\"https://pod.link/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vWUZMNjEyNzkzNjQ5NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Subscribe to the podcast</em></a><em> or watch on </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TechCrunch/featured\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>.

Rivian plans to start selling its more affordable R2 SUV in the first half of 2026. The upcoming R2 is supposed to reach a much wider market than the company’s current R1 SUV and pickup truck and the EV maker has plans to make hundreds of thousands of them per year, including at a new factory in Georgia. Rivian is also looking to expand its automated driving features next year, which it detailed at last week’s inaugural <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/inside-rivians-big-et-on-ai-powered-self-driving/\">Autonomy &amp; AI Day event</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marcario has served on Rivian’s board since January 2021, a role she took after 12 years as an executive (and eventual CEO) of Patagonia. Before her appointment, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe often <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/amazon-invests-rivian-electric-truck-suv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described</a> his aim for the company to become “the Patagonia of EVs.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian said Friday that Marcario will continue her role as chair of the board of trustees overseeing the Rivian Foundation. She serves on that board alongside Scaringe, Rivian’s chief sustainability officer Anisa Kamadoli Costa, and conservationist Ed M. Norton.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Formed just before the company’s blockbuster 2021 IPO, the Rivian Foundation was initially handed 1% of the company’s equity in order to make “the natural world” a “stakeholder in [Rivian’s] success.” The foundation remained quiet for the first few years as Rivian’s stock price fell from its post-IPO highs, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/rivian-foundation-reveals-first-10-million-grantees/\">announced its first $10 million in grants in 2024</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, the Rivian Foundation <a href=\"https://rivianfoundation.org/what-we-fund#our-grantees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has publicized</a> another $2.6 million in awards on its website.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We would like to thank her for her stewardship on the Rivian board over the past 5 years, and look forward to her continued leadership on the Rivian Foundation,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The environment is moving fast, Achadjian told the crowd, and companies are experiencing unprecedented growth.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We spend an enormous, enormous amount of time really assessing the entrepreneur and how resilient they will be able to be in a moment where things are just rapidly changing,” Achadjian said. Now more than ever, founders have to lean into showing their passion and domain expertise, and remain honest about their product market fit, she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is so much demand from enterprise companies to try the latest and greatest AI, sometimes there’s false positives of product market fit,” she explained, “and you can get a lot of revenue with not having true ROI,” meaning customers who are getting their return on investment.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That leads another consideration VCs are looking for: an ability to pivot as the market twists and turns. “There’s a joke that, like, 1,000 startups die and that’s why being resilient is really important,” Achadjian continued.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deng, who used to work at OpenAI, added to Achadjian’s statements. He said founders need to find their unique data flywheels that are going to separate them from the hordes of everyone pitching the exact same idea, especially since the enterprise companies likely testing their products are also testing out a few other competitors at the same time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re able to go deep and really solve a true need for them,” in a way they cannot do themselves, then managing data is “where the important part is,” he said.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders should also have an answer for why their product will not just be a feature added into the foundational models, Achadjian said. It may be okay if a founder doesn’t know if the model makers are working on a competor but they should have a hypothesis on how the business is defensible when pitching investors.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, what’s working in AI seems to be three things, Chen noted: Chat apps, coding apps, and AI in customer service. But there is still so much more change to happen throughout every sector and industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deng is excited by AI-enabled marketplaces. Achadjian, meanwhile, thinks that this could be the moment for robotics, while Chen is curious to see how AI impacts SaaS and othermarkets not yet directly impacted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for what’s not AI and exciting? “Pen and paper processes and digitize them,” Achadjian said. There’s a lot of blue-collar industries that, incredibly, still do many processes manually, she continued. But, they acknowledged even that is ripe for the opportunity to be automated by AI. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, security researchers say there are hundreds of Cisco customers who could potentially be hacked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Piotr Kijewski, the chief executive of the nonprofit Shadowserver Foundation that scans and monitors the internet for hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that the scale of exposure “seems more in the hundreds rather than thousands or tens of thousands.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kijewski said the foundation was not seeing widespread activity, presumably because “current attacks are targeted.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"http://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/tree/?date_range=1&amp;source=http_vulnerable&amp;source=http_vulnerable6&amp;tag=cve-2025-20393%2B&amp;data_set=count&amp;scale=log&amp;auto_update=on\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shadowserver has a page</a> where it’s tracking the number of systems that are exposed and vulnerable to the flaw disclosed by Cisco, named officially as CVE-2025-20393. The vulnerability is known as a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day</a>, because the flaw was discovered before the company had time to make patches available. As of press time, India, Thailand, and the United States collectively have dozens of affected systems within their borders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Censys, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacking activities across the internet, is also seeing a limited number of affected Cisco customers. <a href=\"https://censys.com/advisory/cve-2025-20393\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">According to a blog post</a>, Censys has observed 220 internet-exposed Cisco email gateways, one of the products known to be vulnerable.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this hacking campaign?

Neither of those two conditions are enabled by default, per Cisco, which would explain why there appears to be, relatively speaking, not that many vulnerable systems on the internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cisco did not respond to a request for comment, asking if the company could corroborate the numbers seen by Shadowserver and Censys. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger problem with this hacking campaign is that there are no patches available. Cisco recommends that customers wipe and “restore an affected appliance to a secure state,” as a way to remediate any breach. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“​​In case of confirmed compromise, rebuilding the appliances is, currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actors persistence mechanism from the appliance,” the company wrote in its advisory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Cisco’s threat intelligence arm Talos, the hacking campaign has been ongoing since “at least late November 2025.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Nabla disclosed LeBrun’s new job in a <a href=\"https://www.nabla.com/press-release/nabla-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-advanced-machine-intelligence-to-pioneer-the-next-era-of-agentic-healthcare-ai#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a> and LeCun confirmed it in a brief post on LinkedIn.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Yes, AMI Labs is my new startup. I’m the Executive Chairman. And Alex LeBrun is transitioning from CEO of Nabla to CEO of AMI Labs!” LeCun <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7407558824187867136/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AMI Labs is also reportedly seeking to raise €500 million (about $586 million) at a €3 billion valuation (about $3.5 billion) right out of the gate, before even launching, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d88729c0-c44f-4530-b888-bafa29ee0446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Financial Times reported</a>, citing people familiar with the dealmaking. Given the kind of money that VCs are throwing at AI startups founded by world-recognized AI scientists these days, that’s not even an comparatively outrageous ask.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was valued at $12 billion for its seed round</a> last year. And Murati doesn’t have the same kind of street cred as LeCun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeCun, a professor at New York University who was formerly VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta, <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lecun_6017366.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">won the prestigious A.M. Turing Award</a>, for his work on reinforcement learning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The press release also confirms what everyone knew as well: that AMI Labs is working on world model AI. This is an alternative to LLMs where the AI attempts to understand its environment (aka the world) so it can simulate cause-and-effect and what-if scenarios to predict outcomes. World model creators believe it’s the answer to LLMs’ structural hallucination problems. LLMs can’t be trusted to never fabricate info because it is their very nature to be “non-deterministic” — that is, creative.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Top labs and startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/deepmind-thinks-genie-3-world-model-presents-stepping-stone-towards-agi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google DeepMind</a> and Fei-Fei Li’s startup, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">World Labs</a>, are also developing world models. By that comparison, the fundraising aspirations of AMI might appear a bit more audacious. When World Labs debuted, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-comes-out-of-stealth-with-230m-in-funding/\">Li raised $230 million at a $1 billion valuation</a> right out of the gate, which was considered a lot at the time. But that was way back in August 2024, or about 100 AI years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Nabla says the company will be searching for a new CEO and will be, for now, run by its co-founder and COO, Delphine Groll, who has not been handed the reins permanently yet. Nabla also says it has signed a partnership to use AMI’s models as they are developed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nabla has raised $120 million in total from an all-star list of backers, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nabla-raises-70m-series-c-to-deliver-agentic-ai-to-the-heart-of-clinical-workflows-bringing-total-funding-to-120m-302483646.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">including a $70 million Series C in June</a>. LeCun is one of Nabla’s investors, as is Tony Fadell’s Build Collective, HV Capital, Highland Europe, and Cathay Innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nabla’s LeBrun could be a good choice for CEO. He’s been building multimodal AI since before anyone called it that, working at Nuance Communications in the early 2010s, which originally powered Apple’s Siri in those long-ago years when Siri was wow technology. (Microsoft eventually acquired Nuance.) He founded and sold a couple of natural language startups, including one to Facebook. Then he ran Facebook’s AI division before founding Nabla in 2018, according to his LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeBrun said that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-another-24-million-for-its-ai-assistant-for-doctors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nabla, a darling of the Paris-based AI startup community</a>, is still growing well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have more than tripled our live ARR this year. Up next to $1B!” LeBrun wrote as he announced his departure as CEO. The founder says he will remain on at Nabla as chairman and chief AI scientist. Nabla declined further comment and AMI did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The streamer signed deals with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/netflix-doubles-down-on-video-podcasts-with-iheartmedia-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iHeartMedia</a> and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-dave-portnoy-barstool-sports-exclusive-video-podcasts-1236610822/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Barstool Sports</a> this week, in addition to a recent deal with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a>, to gain exclusive video rights to select shows. The company is also rumored to be in talks with <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-talks-siriusxm-exclusive-video-podcast-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SiriusXM</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Podcasters see this as an offensive move with YouTube as the primary target. And the data provides a convincing argument. According to YouTube, viewers watched over <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcasts-living-room-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">700 million hours</a> of podcasts each month on living room devices (like TVs) in 2025, up from 400 million per month last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As people begin to spend less time watching traditional television, and more time watching short form or low-cost, low-production value content on YouTube, that might present a long-term competitive threat to Netflix,” Matthew Dysart, an entertainment attorney and former head of podcast business affairs at Spotify, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While podcasters might understand the motivation, not everyone is convinced about Netflix’s move. Some podcasters told TechCrunch they’re not sure there is long-term value in video podcasts, while others are worried Netflix is contributing to a podcast bubble.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re basically saying, ‘We want to be the king of content, and the only way we’re going to do that is if we take a swipe at YouTube,’” podcaster Ronald Young Jr. told TechCrunch. Young Jr. thinks people are turning on video podcasts and letting them play in the background, noting that ESPN has been doing some version of this for much longer than we’ve been able to name it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-buzz-of-video-podcasts\">The buzz of video podcasts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When independent podcasters Mike Schubert and Sequoia Simone launched their new show <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/protalkpod/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“Professional Talkers”</a> this year, they noted the buzz around video podcasts and decided to start the new show as a video-first production on YouTube and Spotify.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Neither of us had done video before, so we were like, ‘Why don’t we just start from the beginning and make this a video show?’” Schubert told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Schubert found that his audience was ambivalent toward the video, perhaps because he has spent nearly a decade releasing audio podcasts, cultivating a fanbase that already enjoys and expects audio content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We posted an audio-only episode, and it did pretty similarly, numbers-wise,” he said. “So why would we put so much time and effort into the video and then run the risk of the episode being late when we can just do audio only?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Young Jr. considered investing more energy into video, but decided against it — like Schubert and Simone, he realized that he built an audience that prefers listening to podcasts over viewing them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m like, ‘Well who am I pivoting for?’” he said. “And I realized that the pivot would be for advertisers, for podcast executives, and for people who think that video is the direction that everyone’s going.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, there are some consumers who want to see video — even as a passive show to turn on in the background — as evidenced by YouTube’s staggering viewership stats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mikah Sargent, a podcast producer and host at <a href=\"https://twit.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TWiT.tv</a>, works with shows like “This Week in Tech,” which have had a video component for more than 15 years. <em>(Disclosure: I co-host a show at TWiT.tv once per month.)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Something that I regularly hear from our listeners is … ‘you were my background when I was going through a rough time, or I needed to travel across the country, and having you there to listen to helped me pass the time,’” Sargent told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of passed time with podcasts. So Netflix can look at that and go, ‘Ooh, we get to have this thing that in some cases takes up more time and more streaming than you would get with a typical show.’”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-a-podcast-anyway\">What is a podcast anyway?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a disconnect between how creators and tech companies each think about podcasts. For people who make podcasts, a podcast can be a conversational show like the ones on YouTube, but it can also be a format that doesn’t translate seamlessly to video, like scripted fiction with sound design and voice actors, or the kind of reported, refined audio stories you’d find on NPR. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think this has to do with how squishy the word podcast is now,” podcaster Eric Silver told TechCrunch. “It means anything. It just means show now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For these independent creators, the corporate goings-on between Netflix and Spotify don’t immediately impact their day-to-day. But podcasters remember what happened when Spotify bought up and consolidated a significant chunk of the industry, created a bubble, then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/spotify-layoffs-podcast-industry-fallout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">burst that same bubble itself</a>. The impact reverberated across the industry with <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/spotify-layoffs-the-ringer-podcast-studios-1236420307/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">studio closures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/business/spotify-layoffs-gimlet-podcasts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">layoffs</a>, and a conception among onlookers that podcasting was “dead.” So when another Big Tech company comes waltzing into their industry, they’re skeptical. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In any form of entertainment and media, when companies consolidate, the people who currently have power continue to get richer and richer than the industry underneath it,” Silver said. “The future gets more and more murky, and has less and less resources.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix isn’t making as extreme moves as Spotify. The latter company spent billions acquiring several tech startups and studios, allowing Spotify to control the entire process of making a podcast, from the recording software to the ad sales tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that what Netflix is doing is a little bit more calculated than what Spotify did,” Young Jr. said. “Spotify blindly threw money at the top creators, and they kind of cratered the market in doing so, because the minute you value Joe Rogan at $250 million … you value them so highly that the regular podcaster is like, where do I fall on this?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s seen as an industry-changing infusion of money into the podcast industry isn’t actually that staggering for a company like Netflix, which is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-earnings-top-estimates-but-stock-slips-on-elevated-expectations-133606430.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">on track</a> to make about $45 billion this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Netflix and Spotify are similar in that way — aggressive moves to test a new value proposition by targeting top performers and spending money that ultimately is not that substantial from the perspective of a global tech platform, but is meaningful to the creator economy, to quickly learn if there’s a ‘there’ there,” Dysart said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix has only made deals with media companies thus far, rather than individual creators like Spotify did, but Dysart thinks Netflix’s investments are only beginning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I would expect Netflix to at some point go try to strike a nine-figure deal with a top podcast creator,” he added.  “I would also expect Netflix to take really big swings with very high-profile personalities on original podcasts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Netflix gets its way, our culture will shift away from watching programmatic daytime TV and talk shows and toward watching podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Back in the day, my mom would have a soap opera playing in the background while she was doing things, and I was definitely the person who would have ‘The Office’ playing in the background while I’m doing things,” Sargent said. “Now people get to have a podcast playing in the background while they’re doing things, and if Netflix can be the place where they go to do that, then I think it’s a win for the company.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
