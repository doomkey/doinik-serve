Propelled by its young and curious founders, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://flappingairplanes.com/\">Flapping Airplanes</a> is focused on finding less data-hungry ways to train AI. It’s a potential game-changer for the economics and capabilities of AI models — and with $180 million in seed funding, they’ll have plenty of runway to figure it out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, I spoke with the lab’s three co-founders — brothers Ben and Asher Spector, and Aidan Smith — about why this is an exciting moment to start a new AI lab and why they keep coming back to ideas about the human brain.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>I want to start by asking, why now? Labs like OpenAI and DeepMind have spent so much on scaling their models. I’m sure the competition seems daunting. Why did this feel like a good moment to launch a foundation model company?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong> There’s just so much to do. So, the advances that we’ve gotten over the last five to ten years have been spectacular. We love the tools. We use them every day. But the question is, is this the whole universe of things that needs to happen? And we thought about it very carefully and our answer was no, there’s a lot more to do. In our case, we thought that the data efficiency problem was sort of really the key thing to go look at. The current frontier models are trained on the sum totality of human knowledge, and humans can obviously make do with an awful lot less. So there’s a big gap there, and it’s worth understanding. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What we’re doing is really a concentrated bet on three things. It’s a bet that this data efficiency problem is the important thing to be doing. Like, this is really a direction that is new and different and you can make progress on it. It’s a bet that this will be very commercially valuable and that will make the world a better place if we can do it. And it’s also a bet that’s sort of the right kind of team to do it is a creative and even in some ways inexperienced team that can go look at these problems again from the ground up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. We don’t really see ourselves as competing with the other labs, because we think that we’re looking at just a very different set of problems. If you look at the human mind, it learns in an incredibly different way from transformers. And that’s not to say better, just very different. So we see these different trade offs. LLMs have an incredible ability to memorize, and draw on this great breadth of knowledge, but they can’t really pick up new skills very fast. It takes just rivers and rivers of data to adapt. And when you look inside the brain, you see that the algorithms that it uses are just fundamentally so different from gradient descent and some of the techniques that people use to train AI today. So that’s why we’re building a new guard of researchers to kind of address these problems and really think differently about the AI space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher</strong>: This question is just so scientifically interesting: why are the systems that we have built that are intelligent also so different from what humans do? Where does this difference come from? How can we use knowledge of that difference to make better systems? But at the same time, I also think it’s actually very commercially viable and very good for the world. Lots of regimes that are really important are also highly data constrained, like robotics or scientific discovery. Even in enterprise applications, a model that’s a million times more data efficient is probably a million times easier to put into the economy. So for us, it was very exciting to take a fresh perspective on these approaches, and think, if we really had a model that’s vastly more data efficient, what could we do with it?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>This gets into my next question, which is sort of ties in also to the name, Flapping Airplanes. There’s this philosophical question in AI about how much we’re trying to recreate what humans do in their brain, versus creating some more abstract intelligence that takes a completely different path. Aidan is coming from Neuralink, which is all about the human brain. Do you see yourself as kind of pursuing a more neuromorphic view of AI? </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan: </strong>The way I look at the brain is as an existence proof. We see it as evidence that there are other algorithms out there. There’s not just one orthodoxy. And the brain has some crazy constraints. When you look at the underlying hardware, there’s some crazy stuff. It takes a millisecond to fire an action potential. In that time, your computer can do just so so many operations. And so realistically, there’s probably an approach that’s actually much better than the brain out there, and also very different than the transformer. So we’re very inspired by some of the things that the brain does, but we don’t see ourselves being tied down by it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>Just to add on to that. it’s very much in our name: Flapping Airplanes. Think of the current systems as big, Boeing 787s. We’re not trying to build birds. That’s a step too far. We’re trying to build some kind of a flapping airplane. My perspective from computer systems is that the constraints of the brain and silicon are sufficiently different from each other that we should not expect these systems to end up looking the same. When the substrate is so different and you have genuinely very different trade-offs about the cost of compute, the cost of locality and moving data, you actually expect these systems to look a little bit different. But just because they will look somewhat different does not mean that we should not take inspiration from the brain and try to use the parts that we think are interesting to improve our own systems. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>It does feel like there’s now more freedom for labs to focus on research, as opposed to, just developing products. It feels like a big difference for this generation of labs. You have some that are very research focused, and others that are sort of “research focused for now.” What does that conversation look like within flapping airplanes?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher:</strong> I wish I could give you a timeline. I wish I could say, in three years, we’re going to have solved the research problem. This is how we’re going to commercialize. I can’t. We don’t know the answers. We’re looking for truth. That said, I do think we have commercial backgrounds. I spent a bunch of time developing technology for companies that made those companies a reasonable amount of money. Ben has incubated a bunch of startups that have commercial backgrounds, and we actually are excited to commercialize. We think it’s good for the world to take the value you’ve created and put it in the hands of people who can use it. So I don’t think we’re opposed to it. We just need to start by doing research, because if we start by signing big enterprise contracts, we’re going to get distracted, and we won’t do the research that’s valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan:</strong> Yeah, we want to try really, really radically different things, and sometimes radically even things are just worse than the paradigm. We’re exploring a set of different trade offs. It’s our hope that they will be different in the long run. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>Companies are at their best when they’re really focused on doing something well, right? Big companies can afford to do many, many different things at once. When you’re a startup, you really have to pick what is the most valuable thing you can do, and do that all the way. And we are creating the most value when we are all in on solving fundamental problems for the time being. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m actually optimistic that reasonably soon, we might have made enough progress that we can then go start to touch grass in the real world. And you learn a lot by getting feedback from the real world. The amazing thing about the world is, it teaches you things constantly, right? It’s this tremendous vat of truth that you get to look into whenever you want. I think the main thing that I think has been enabled by the recent change in the economics and financing of these structures is the ability to let companies really focus on what they’re good at for longer periods of time. I think that focus, the thing that I’m most excited about, that will let us do really differentiated work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>To spell out what I think you’re referring to: there’s so much excitement around and the opportunity for investors is so clear that they are willing to give $180 million in seed funding to a completely new company full of these very smart, but also very young people who didn’t just cash out of PayPal or anything. How was it engaging with that process? Did you know, going in, there is this appetite, or was it something you discovered, of like, actually, we can make this a bigger thing than we thought.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong> I would say it was a mixture of the two. The market has been hot for many months at this point. So it was not a secret that no large rounds were starting to come together. But you never quite know how the fundraising environment will respond to your particular ideas about the world. This is, again, a place where you have to let the world give you feedback about what you’re doing. Even over the course of our fundraise, we learned a lot and actually changed our ideas. And we refined our opinions of the things we should be prioritizing, and what the right timelines were for commercialization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think we were somewhat surprised by how well our message resonated, because it was something that was very clear to us, but you never know whether your ideas will turn out to be things that other people believe as well or if everyone else thinks you’re crazy. We have been extremely fortunate to have found a group of amazing investors who our message really resonated with and they said, “Yes, this is exactly what we’ve been looking for.” And that was amazing. It was, you know, surprising and wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan:</strong> Yeah, a thirst for the age of research has kind of been in the water for a little bit now. And more and more, we find ourselves positioned as the player to pursue the age of research and really try these radical ideas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>At least for the scale-driven companies, there is this enormous cost of entry for foundation models. Just building a model at that scale is an incredibly compute-intensive thing. Research is a little bit in the middle, where presumably you are building foundation models, but if you’re doing it with less data and you’re not so scale-oriented, maybe you get a bit of a break. How much do you expect compute costs to be sort of limiting your runway.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong> One of the advantages of doing deep, fundamental research is that, somewhat paradoxically, it is much cheaper to do really crazy, radical ideas than it is to do incremental work. Because when you do incremental work, in order to find out whether or not it does work, you have to go very far up the scaling ladder. Many interventions that look good at small scale do not actually persist at large scale. So as a result, it’s very expensive to do that kind of work. Whereas if you have some crazy new idea about some new architecture optimizer, it’s probably just gonna fail on the first rum, right? So you don’t have to run this up the ladder. It’s already broken. That’s great. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, this doesn’t mean that scale is irrelevant for us. Scale is actually an important tool in the toolbox of all the things that you can do. Being able to scale up our ideas is certainly relevant to our company. So I wouldn’t frame us as the antithesis of scale, but I think it is a wonderful aspect of the kind of work we’re doing, that we can try many of our ideas at very small scale before we would even need to think about doing them at large scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher: </strong>Yeah, you should be able to use all the internet. But you shouldn’t <em>need</em> to. We find it really, really perplexing that you need to use all the Internet to really get this human level intelligence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>So, what becomes possible  if you’re able to train more efficiently on data, right? Presumably the model will be more powerful and intelligent. But do you have specific ideas about kind of where that goes? Are we looking at more out-of-distribution generalization, or are we looking at sort of models that get better at a particular task with less experience?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher: </strong>So, first, we’re doing science, so I don’t know the answer, but I can give you three hypotheses. So my first hypothesis is that there’s a broad spectrum between just looking for statistical patterns and something that has really deep understanding. And I think the current models live somewhere on that spectrum. I don’t think they’re all the way towards deep understanding, but they’re also clearly not just doing statistical pattern matching. And it’s possible that as you train models on less data, you really force the model to have incredibly deep understandings of everything it’s seen. And as you do that, the model may become more intelligent in very interesting ways. It may know less facts, but get better at reasoning. So that’s one potential hypothesis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another hypothesis is similar to what you said, that at the moment, it’s very expensive, both operationally and also in pure monetary costs, to teach models new capabilities, because you need so much data to teach them those things. It’s possible that one output of what we’re doing is to get vastly more efficient at post training, so with only a couple of examples, you could really put a model into a new domain. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then it’s also possible that this just unlocks new verticals for AI. There are certain types of robotics, for instance, where for whatever reason, we can’t quite get the type of capabilities that really makes it commercially viable. My opinion is that it’s a limited data problem, not a hardware problem. The fact that you can tele-operate the robots to do stuff is proof that that the hardware is sufficiently good. Butthere’s lots of domains like this, like scientific discovery. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>One thing I’ll also double-click on is that when we think about the impact that AI can have on the world, one view you might have is that this is a deflationary technology. That is, the role of AI is to automate a bunch of jobs, and take that work and make it cheaper to do, so that you’re able to remove work from the economy and have it done by robots instead. And I’m sure that will happen. But this is not, to my mind, the most exciting vision of AI. The most exciting vision of AI is one where there’s all kinds of new science and technologies that we can construct that humans aren’t smart enough to come up with, but other systems can. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On this aspect, I think that first axis that Ascher was talking about around the spectrum between sort of true generalization versus memorization or interpolation of the data, I think that axis is extremely important to have the deep insights that will lead to these new advances in medicine and science. It is important that the models are very much on the creativity side of the spectrum. And so, part of why I’m very excited about the work that we’re doing is that I think even beyond the individual economic impacts, I’m also just genuinely very kind of mission-oriented around the question of, can we actually get AI to do stuff that, like, fundamentally humans couldn’t do before? And that’s more than just, “Let’s go fire a bunch of people from their jobs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Absolutely. Does that put you in a particular camp on, like, the AGI conversation, the like out of distribution, generalization conversation.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher: </strong>I really don’t exactly know what AGI means. It’s clear that capabilities are advancing very quickly. It’s clear that there’s tremendous amounts of economic value that’s being created. I don’t think we’re very close to God-in-a-box, in my opinion. I don’t think that within two months or even two years, there’s going to be a singularity where suddenly humans are completely obsolete. I basically agree with what Ben said at the beginning, which is, it’s a really big world. There’s a lot of work to do. There’s a lot of amazing work being done, and we’re excited to contribute</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Well, the idea about the brain and the neuromorphic part of it does feel relevant. You’re saying, really the relevant thing to compare LLMs to is the human brain, more than the Mechanical Turk or the deterministic computers that came before.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan: </strong>I’ll emphasize, the brain is not the ceiling, right? The brain, in many ways, is the floor. Frankly, I see no evidence that the brain is not a knowable system that follows physical laws. In fact, we know it’s under many constraints. And so we would expect to be able to create capabilities that are much, much more interesting and different and potentially better than the brain in the long run. And so we’re excited to contribute to that future, whether that’s AGI or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher: </strong>And I do think the brain is the relevant comparison, just because the brain helps us understand how big the space is. Like, it’s easy to see all the progress we’ve made and think, wow, we like, have the answer. We’re almost done. But if you look outward a little bit and try to have a bit more perspective, there’s a lot of stuff we don’t know. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>We’re not trying to be better, per se. We’re trying to be different, right? That’s the key thing I really want to hammer on here. All of these systems will almost certainly have different trade offs of them. You’ll get an advantage somewhere, and it’ll cost you somewhere else. And it’s a big world out there. There are so many different domains that have so many different trade offs that having more system, and more fundamental technologies that can address these different domains is very likely to make the kind of AI diffuse more effectively and more rapidly through the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of the ways you’ve distinguished yourself, is in your hiring approach, getting people who are very, very young, in some cases, still in college or high school. What is it that clicks for you when you’re talking to someone and that makes you think, I want this person working with us on these research problems?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Aidan: </strong>It’s when you talk to someone and they just dazzle you, they have so many new ideas and they think about things in a way that many established researchers just can’t because they haven’t been polluted by the context of thousands and thousands of papers. Really, the number one thing we look for is creativity. Our team is so exceptionally creative, and every day, I feel really lucky to get to go in and talk about really radical solutions to some of the big problems in AI with people and dream up a very different future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong>  Probably the number one signal that I’m personally looking for is just like, do they teach me something new when I spend time with them? If they teach me something new, the odds that they’re going to teach us something new about what we’re working on is also pretty good. When you’re doing research, those creative, new ideas are really the priority. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of my background was during my undergrad and PhD., I helped start this incubator called Prod that worked with a bunch of companies that turned out well. And I think one of the things that we saw from that was that young people can absolutely compete in the very highest echelons of industry. Frankly, a big part of the unlock is just realizing, yeah, I can go do this stuff. You can absolutely go contribute at the highest level. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, we do recognize the value of experience. People who have worked on large scale systems are great, like, we’ve hired some of them, you know, we are excited to work with all sorts of folks. And I think our mission has resonated with the experienced folks as well. I just think that our key thing is that we want people who are not afraid to change the paradigm and can try to imagine a new system of how things might work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of things I’ve been puzzling about is, how different do you think the resulting AI systems are going to be? It’s easy for me to imagine something like Claude Opus that just works 20% better and can do 20% more things. But if it’s just completely new, it’s hard to think about where that goes or what the end result looks like.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher:</strong> I don’t know if you’ve ever had the privilege of talking to the GPT-4 base model, but it had a lot of really strange emerging capabilities. For example, you could take a snippet of an unwritten blog post of yours, and ask, who do you think wrote this, and it could identify it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a lot of capabilities like this, where models are smart in ways we cannot fathom. And future models will be smarter in even stranger ways. I think we should expect the future to be really weird and the architectures to be even weirder. We’re looking for 1000x wins in data efficiency. We’re not trying to make incremental change. And so we should expect the same kind of unknowable, alien changes and capabilities at the limit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ben: I broadly agree with that. I’m probably slightly more tempered in how these things will eventually become experienced by the world, just as the GPT-4 base model was tempered by OpenAI. You want to put things in forms where you’re not staring into the abyss as a consumer. I think that’s important. But I broadly agree that our research agenda is about building capabilities that really are quite fundamentally different from what can be done right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Fantastic! Are there ways people can engage with flapping airplanes? Is it too early for that? Or they should just stay tuned for when the research and the models come out well.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher:</strong> So, we have Hi@flappingairplanes.com. If you just want to say hi, We also have disagree@flappingairplanes.com if you want to disagree with us. We’ve actually had some really cool conversations where people, like, send us very long essays about why they think it’s impossible to do what we’re doing. And we’re happy to engage with it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben:</strong> But they haven’t convinced us yet. No one has convinced us yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Asher:</strong> The second thing is, you know, we are, we are looking for exceptional people who are trying to change the field and change the world. So if you’re interested, you should reach out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ben: </strong>And if you have another unorthodox background, it’s okay. You don’t need two PhDs. We really are looking for folks who think differently.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With Moltbook’s security vulnerabilities, it became impossible to determine the authenticity of any post on the network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anyone, even humans, could create an account, impersonating robots in an interesting way, and then even upvote posts without any guardrails or rate limits,” John Hammond, a senior principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Moltbook made for a fascinating moment in internet culture — people recreated a social internet for AI bots, including a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moltmatch.com/\">Tinder for agents</a> and 4claw, a riff on 4chan.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More broadly, this incident on Moltbook is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise. It is technology that seems novel and exciting, but ultimately, some AI experts think that its inherent cybersecurity flaws are rendering the technology unusable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openclaw-s-viral-moment\">OpenClaw’s viral moment</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenClaw is a project of Austrian vibe coder <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://steipete.me/\">Peter Steinberger</a>, initially released as Clawdbot (naturally, Anthropic <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/clawdbot-changes-name-moltbot-anthropic-trademark-2026-1\">took issue</a> with that name).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The open-source AI agent amassed over 190,000 stars on Github, making it the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/EvanLi/Github-Ranking/blob/master/Top100/Top-100-stars.md\">21st most popular</a> code repository ever posted on the platform. AI agents are not novel, but OpenClaw made them easier to use and to communicate with customizable agents in natural language via WhatsApp, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and most other popular messaging apps. OpenClaw users can leverage whatever underlying AI model they have access to, whether that be via Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or something else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the end of the day, OpenClaw is still just a wrapper to ChatGPT, or Claude,  or whatever AI model you stick to it,” Hammond said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With OpenClaw, users can download “skills” from a marketplace called ClawHub, which can make it possible to automate most of what one could do on a computer, from managing an email inbox to trading stocks. The skill associated with Moltbook, for example, is what enabled AI agents to post, comment, and browse on the website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on what people are already doing, and most of that iterative improvement has to do with giving it more access,” Chris Symons, chief AI scientist at Lirio, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Artem Sorokin, an AI engineer and the founder of AI cybersecurity tool Cracken, also thinks OpenClaw isn’t necessarily breaking new scientific ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“From an AI research perspective, this is nothing novel,” he told TechCrunch. “These are components that already existed. The key thing is that it hit a new capability threshold by just organizing and combining these existing capabilities that already were thrown together in a way that enabled it to give you a very seamless way to get tasks done autonomously.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s this level of unprecedented access and productivity that made OpenClaw so viral. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It basically just facilitates interaction between computer programs in a way that is just so much more dynamic and flexible, and that’s what’s allowing all these things to become possible,” Symons said. “Instead of a person having to spend all the time to figure out how their program should plug into this program, they’re able to just ask their program to plug in this program, and that’s accelerating things at a fantastic rate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s no wonder that OpenClaw seems so enticing. Developers are snatching up Mac Minis to power extensive OpenClaw setups that might be able to accomplish far more than a human could on their own. And it makes OpenAI CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/what-exactly-is-an-ai-agent/\">Sam Altman’s prediction</a> that AI agents will allow a solo entrepreneur to turn a startup into a unicorn, seem plausible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can’t think critically like humans can.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you think about human higher-level thinking, that’s one thing that maybe these models can’t really do,” Symons said. “They can simulate it, but they can’t actually do it. “</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-existential-threat-to-agentic-ai\">The existential threat to agentic AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI agent evangelists now must wrestle with the downside of this agentic future. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Can you sacrifice some cybersecurity for your benefit, if it actually works and it actually brings you a lot of value?” Sorokin asks. “And where exactly can you sacrifice it — your day-to-day job, your work?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahl’s security tests of OpenClaw and Moltbook help illustrate Sorokin’s point. Ahl created an AI agent of his own named Rufio and quickly discovered it was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This occurs when bad actors get an AI agent to respond to something — perhaps a post on Moltbook, or a line in an email — that tricks it into doing something it shouldn’t do, like giving out account credentials or credit card information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I knew one of the reasons I wanted to put an agent on here is because I knew if you get a social network for agents, somebody is going to try to do mass prompt injection, and it wasn’t long before I started seeing that,” Ahl said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As he scrolled through Moltbook, Ahl wasn’t surprised to encounter several posts seeking to get an AI agent to send Bitcoin to a specific crypto wallet address.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not hard to see how AI agents on a corporate network, for example, might be vulnerable to targeted prompt injections from people trying to harm the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is just an agent sitting with a bunch of credentials on a box connected to everything — your email, your messaging platform, everything you use,” Ahl said. “So what that means is, when you get an email, and maybe somebody is able to put a little prompt injection technique in there to take an action, that agent sitting on your box with access to everything you’ve given it to can now take that action.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI agents are designed with guardrails protecting against prompt injections, but it’s impossible to assure that an AI won’t act out of turn — it’s like how a human might be knowledgable about the risk of phishing attacks, yet still click on a dangerous link in a suspicious email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve heard some people use the term, hysterically, ‘prompt begging,’ where you try to add in the guardrails in natural language to say, ‘Okay robot agent, please don’t respond to anything external, please don’t believe any untrusted data or input,’” Hammond said. “But even that is loosey goosey.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the industry is stuck: for agentic AI to unlock the productivity that tech evangelists think is possible, it can’t be so vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Speaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don’t use it right now,” Hammond said.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That shift has prompted Peak XV Partners to back <a href=\"https://c2isemi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">C2i Semiconductors</a>, an Indian startup building plug-and-play, system-level power solutions designed to cut energy losses and improve the economics of large-scale AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">C2i (which stands for control conversion and intelligence) has raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Peak XV Partners, with participation from Yali Deeptech and TDK Ventures, bringing the two-year-old startup’s total funding to $19 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investment comes as data-center energy demand accelerates worldwide. Electricity consumption from data centers is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">projected to nearly triple by 2035</a>, per a December 2025 report from BloombergNEF, while Goldman Sachs Research estimates data-center power demand <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-research/data-center-power-demand-the-6-ps-driving-growth-and-constraints\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">could surge 175% by 2030</a> from 2023 levels — the equivalent of adding another top-10 power-consuming country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of that strain comes not from generating electricity but from converting it efficiently inside data centers, where high-voltage power must be stepped down thousands of times before it reaches GPUs. This process currently wastes about 15% to 20% of energy, C2i’s co-founder and CTO Preetam Tadeparthy said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What used to be 400 volts has already moved to 800 volts, and will likely go higher,” Tadeparthy told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2024 by former Texas Instruments power executives Ram Anant, Vikram Gakhar, Preetam Tadeparthy, and Dattatreya Suryanarayana, along with Harsha S.

Rajan Anandan, the venture firm’s managing director, told TechCrunch that after the upfront capital investment in servers and facilities, energy costs become the dominant ongoing expense for data centers, making even incremental efficiency gains highly valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you can reduce energy costs by, call it, 10 to 30%, that’s like a huge number,” Anandan said. “You’re talking about tens of billions of dollars.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The claims will be tested quickly. C2i expects its first two silicon designs to return from fabrication between April and June, after which the startup plans to validate performance with data-center operators and hyperscalers that have asked to review the data, according to Tadeparthy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based startup has built a team of about 65 engineers and is setting up customer-facing operations in the U.S. and Taiwan as it prepares for early deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Power delivery is one of the most entrenched parts of the data-center stack, long dominated by large incumbents with deep balance sheets and years-long qualification cycles. While many newer companies focus on improving individual components, redesigning power delivery end-to-end requires coordinating silicon, packaging, and system architecture simultaneously — a capital-intensive approach that few startups attempt and one that can take years to prove in production environments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anandan said the real question now is execution, noting that all startups face technology, market, and team risks when betting on how industries evolve. In C2i’s case, he said, the feedback loop should be relatively short. “We’ll know in the next six months,” said Anandan, pointing to upcoming silicon and early customer validation as the moment when the thesis will be tested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bet also reflects how India’s semiconductor design ecosystem has matured in recent years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way you should look at semiconductors in India is, this is like 2008 e-commerce,” said Anandan. “It’s just getting started.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He pointed to the depth of engineering talent — with a growing share of global chip designers based in the country — alongside government-backed design-linked incentives that have lowered the cost and risk of tape-outs, making it increasingly viable for startups to build globally competitive semiconductor products from India rather than operate only as captive design centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether those conditions translate into a globally competitive product will become clearer over the coming months, as C2i begins validating its system-level power solutions with customers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Altman is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/openai-chief-sam-altman-plans-india-visit-as-ai-leaders-converge-in-new-delhi-sources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">attending the event</a> alongside senior executives from several of the world’s leading AI companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The growth comes as OpenAI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">like other leading AI firms</a>, looks to India’s young population and its more than a billion internet users to fuel global expansion. The ChatGPT maker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened a New Delhi office</a> in August 2025 after months of groundwork in the country, and has adjusted its approach for India’s price-sensitive market, including rolling out a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sub-$5 ChatGPT Go tier</a> that was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">later made free for a year</a> for Indian users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the article, Altman said India is ChatGPT’s second-largest user base after the United States, highlighting the South Asian nation’s growing weight in OpenAI’s global strategy. The disclosure comes as ChatGPT’s overall usage has surged worldwide, with the platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reaching 800 million weekly active users</a> as of October 2025 and reported to be <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/newsletters/ai-agenda/chatgpt-nears-900-million-weekly-active-users-gemini-catching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">approaching 900 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman also highlighted the role of students in driving adoption, saying India has the largest number of student users of ChatGPT globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indian students have become a key growth segment for leading AI companies more broadly, as rivals race to embed their tools in classrooms and learning workflows. Google has similarly targeted the market, offering Indian students a <a href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/technology/students-in-india-just-got-a-gemini-upgrade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan</a> in September 2025. Separately, India accounts for the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/india-is-teaching-google-how-ai-in-education-can-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highest global usage of Gemini for learning</a>, Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, said last month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With its focus on access, practical Al literacy, and the infrastructure that supports widespread adoption, India is well positioned to broaden who benefits from the technology and to help shape how democratic AI is adopted at scale,” Altman wrote.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s rapid growth also highlights a broader challenge for AI companies in India: translating widespread adoption into sustained economic impact. Indian government initiatives such as the IndiaAI Mission — a national program aimed at expanding computing capacity, supporting startups and accelerating AI adoption in public services — seek to address those gaps. However, the country’s price-sensitive market and infrastructure constraints have made monetization and large-scale deployment more complex than in developed economies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given India’s size, it also risks forfeiting a vital opportunity to advance democratic AI in emerging markets around the world,” Altman wrote, warning that uneven access and adoption could concentrate AI’s economic gains in too few hands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman also signaled that OpenAI plans to deepen its engagement with the Indian government, writing that the company would soon announce new partnerships aimed at expanding access to AI across the country. He did not provide details, but said the focus would be on widening reach and enabling more people to put AI tools to practical use.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://impact.indiaai.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">India AI Impact Summit</a> is expected to draw a wide cross-section of global technology and political leaders, including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Sundar Pichai of Google, and senior Indian business figures such as Mukesh Ambani and Nandan Nilekani.

Microsoft is bundling Copilot into Office. Google is pushing Gemini into Workspace. OpenAI and Anthropic are selling directly to enterprises. Every SaaS vendor now ships an AI assistant. </p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the scramble for the interface, Glean is betting on something less visible: becoming the intelligence layer beneath it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seven years ago, Glean set out to be the Google for enterprise — an AI-powered search tool designed to index and search across a company’s SaaS tool library, from Slack to Jira, Google Drive to Salesforce. Today, the company’s strategy has shifted from building a better enterprise chatbot to becoming the connective tissue between models and enterprise systems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The layer we built initially – a good search product – required us to deeply understand people and how they work and what their preferences are,” Jain told TechCrunch on last week’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/glean-arvind-jain-equity-podcast-own-the-ai-layer-inside-every-company/\">episode of Equity</a>, which we recorded at Web Summit Qatar. “All of that is now becoming foundational in terms of building high quality agents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He says that while large language models are powerful, they’re also generic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AI models themselves don’t really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don’t know who the different people are, they don’t know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Glean’s pitch is that it already maps that context and can sit between the model and the enterprise data. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Who will own your company’s AI layer?

But what keeps customers, Jain argues, is everything underneath it. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First is model access. Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to switch between or combine models as capabilities evolve. That’s why Jain says he doesn’t see OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google as competition, but rather as partners. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our product gets better because we’re able to leverage the innovation that they are making in the market,” Jain said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Second are the connectors. Glean integrates deeply with systems like Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and Google Drive to map how information flows across them and enable agents to act inside those tools. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And third, and perhaps most important, is governance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You need to build a permissions-aware governance layer and retrieval layer that is able to bring the right information, but knowing who’s asking that question so that it filters the information based on their access rights,” Jain said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In large organizations, that layer can be the difference between piloting AI solutions and deploying them at scale. Enterprises can’t simply load all their internal data into a model and create a wrapper to sort out the solutions later, says Jain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also critical is ensuring the models don’t hallucinate. Jain says its system verifies model outputs against source documents, generates line-by-line citations, and ensures that responses respect existing access rights. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question is whether that middle layer survives as platform giants push deeper into the stack. Microsoft and Google already control much of the enterprise workflow surface area, and they’re hungry for more. If Copilot or Gemini can access the same internal systems with the same permissions, does a standalone intelligence layer still matter?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jain argues enterprises don’t want to be locked into a single model or productivity suite and would rather opt for a neutral infrastructure layer rather than a vertically integrated assistant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors have bought into that thesis. Glean raised a $150 million Series F in June 2025, nearly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/enterprise-ai-startup-glean-lands-a-7-2b-valuation/\">doubling its valuation to $7.2 billion</a>. Unlike the frontier AI labs, Glean doesn’t need massive compute budgets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a very healthy, fast-growing business,” Jain said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And it’s not just that I like numbers. These required filings cut through a lot of the marketing noise presented by companies the rest of the year. They also help me assess the short- and long-term stakes the companies face.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rivian</strong>’s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings did precisely that. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/rivian-was-saved-by-software-in-2025/\">My takeaway</a>: Software, and specifically its technology joint venture with Volkswagen Group, was the company’s savior in 2025. It will also buoy the company into 2026 (another $2 billion is expected from VW Group) as Rivian launches its most important product to date: the lower-cost R2 SUV. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s earnings also provided a progress report on its bid to lower the cost of goods sold per unit. The TL;DR is that the cogs per unit for its current portfolio is still high but dropping, meaning it’s losing less on each vehicle it sells. According to Rivian, the company’s automotive cogs per unit delivered was $100,900 in 2025, down from $110,400 in 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upcoming R2, which is supposed to be considerably cheaper (both in production cost and price tag) than its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV, will be the next big test. We’ll get some insight into the results of that later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The R2 is expected to go into production in the first half of the year (we’re hearing June), and based on its guidance for 2026, Rivian is confident it has the demand and the ability to ramp production. The company expects to deliver between 62,000 and 67,000 vehicles in 2026 — which could provide up to a 59% bump from last year. Rivian delivered 42,247 vehicles in 2025, which includes its two R1 consumer vehicles and the electric delivery van (EDV).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market loved that guidance, btw. Rivian stock shot up 27% in the day after it reported earnings.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past 18 months, I’ve noticed a divergence in how <strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> are approaching AVs. Uber is locking up AV partnerships with every player it can. Lyft is trailing behind. Turns out, I am not alone in this observation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insiders have shared their puzzlement about why Lyft hasn’t been more aggressive on this front. They noted that Lyft is sitting on about $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, and recently announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program that represents about 15% of its market cap, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/02/13/ai-firms-like-openai-seek-nvidia-alternatives.html\">per CNBC</a>. That has some wondering why Lyft did not invest in parts of the AV value chain like Uber is doing versus buying shares back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, these little birds also pointed to a few top executives who have departed over the past year. Aurélien Nolf left his position as VP of financial planning and analysis and investor relations to become CFO of Navan. Audrey Liu, who was an executive VP and head of rider and community safety, is now at Adobe. Ameena Gill, who was VP of safety and customer care just took a job at rival Uber.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

Many of the dominant and buzziest ones have since shuttered, while some of the smallest players have hung on and expanded. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Take <strong>Ouster</strong>, for instance. I remember way back when Ouster had this tiny little booth in the jam-packed startups area (Eureka Park) at CES. Today, the company is much bigger — thanks to scale, its 2022 merger with rival Velodyne, and its acquisition of Sense Photonics in 2021. And it doesn’t appear to be finished. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/lidar-maker-ouster-buys-vision-company-stereolabs-as-sensor-consolidation-continues/\">most recently acquired</a> <strong>Stereolabs</strong>, a company that makes vision-based perception systems for robotics and industrial applications, for a combination of $35 million and 1.8 million shares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TechCrunch senior reporter Sean O’Kane notes in his article, the deal is the latest in a march toward consolidation among perception sensor suppliers. (Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/luminar-sale-approved-despite-last-minute-mystery-bid/\">for $33 million</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So why all the activity? It’s complicated, as they say. From my POV, the frenzy around “physical AI” has reignited interest and investment in sensor technologies, particularly cameras.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ever</strong>, the EV-only marketplace, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/eclipse-backs-all-ev-marketplace-ever-in-31m-funding-round/\">raised $31 million</a> in a Series A funding round led by Eclipse.

And that was why I started looking through these files, in part because a long time ago, flashback 10 years ago on my beat especially, there was just a ton of Chinese investment in the space. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was before even the rush of EV startups in China that we see today […] In autonomous vehicles, but electric vehicles especially, there was this moment where Chinese investors and Chinese companies, state-owned automakers, all they wanted to do was to be looked at like Silicon Valley startups. So they came here and they invested in companies and helped get them off the ground, or in some cases even set up offices in Silicon Valley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it was in that environment that a lot of the companies that I’ve covered for a long time popped up. There was just never a full picture of how a lot of them were funded. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One in particular, this company called Canoo, which is now bankrupt and out of business, had maybe the most mysterious set of investors of all of them. They really were not upfront about it when they first sort of came out of stealth in early 2018. And it frankly took until there was a lawsuit between some people who ran the company near the top that the investors were revealed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, it was this businessman in China who was relatively close, the son-in-law of the former sort of like the fourth most senior CCP official under the previous leader of China and a giant electronics magnate from Taiwan. And then there was this really strange guy named David Stern, who was the third founding investor. And there was so little information about this guy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I could tell, back then, that he was some sort of German businessman, that he had some connections to China, but it wasn’t really clear how he had gotten involved. The only thing I really remember hearing at the time was that he was close with Prince Andrew, which I just thought was very strange, this idea that someone had even told me a long time ago, probably in 2018 or 2019, that Prince Andrew was involved with this company Canoo in some way, maybe not invested, but advising or something.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was something that stuck in my head for a very long time, clearly, because I went looking for that information as more of these files came out, assuming that proximity to Prince Andrew means proximity to someone like Epstein.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that was the case here, more so than I could have imagined, because this guy Stern turned from an enigma or a ghost into someone who was present through all this dealmaking 10 years ago, where we see him pitching, in the span of about a year and a half, investments in Faraday Future, trying to convince Epstein to maybe throw a couple hundred million dollars into that company, trying to buy the 30% stake that Faraday Future’s founder had bought or acquired in Lucid Motors arrival at the time, which I feel is an overlooked dynamic [in] how those companies grew around then — and then also in Canoo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epstein never invested in any of those companies despite that proximity, but it was just such a revealing thing. And I get into it in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/prince-andrew-advisor-pitched-jeffrey-epstein-on-investing-in-ev-startups-like-lucid-motors/\">the story that I wrote last week</a>, but we get this sweep of a decade of relationship that Stern had with Epstein from approaching him initially in 2008, kind of hat in hand, and introducing himself and saying, “Hey, I want to invest in China. Will you throw in some money?” to being someone who was seemingly very close to him by the end. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Kirsten:</strong> The whole thing is really interesting, and it goes back to my initial comments about how sometimes when you get a chance to look back at with new information at how deals were unfolding, it really just changes your perception and perspective of the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And for those who didn’t follow quote-unquote “mobility,” think of it as how we’re thinking about physical AI these days. Everyone was talking about it. Every automaker wanted to have a piece of quote-unquote “the future of transportation” or “mobility.” And so it makes a lot of sense that some of these more secretive types were also jumping in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sean, one of the points you made to me as I was working on the story with you, in terms of editing it, you were [saying], it was very clear that Epstein and David Stern weren’t really about investing and building companies. It was all about how to make the most money the fastest. And that, I think, is really historically important and interesting and gives you a little bit of an insight into — in addition to all the horrible, horrifying, terrible things he did to human beings, [Epstein] was a complete operator as well, in order to make money as quickly as possible. And you see that in these emails and exchanges between David Stern and Epstein.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Sean:</strong> Yeah, to both of those points really, I open the story with a moment in time where Lucid Motors […] they had been basically a battery supplier for a long time and then they pivoted into the passenger vehicle startup that we know them as today, but they were really struggling to raise their Series D at the time, and they really needed that money to start production of their first electric sedan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They were struggling, behind the scenes in large part because the founder of Arrival quietly amassed this major stake and was kind of pushing people away and making it look like an uninvestable company in some ways, but the hype around all of that at the time was creating opportunities for people like Stern and Epstein, and we see them talk in these emails about, you know, Stern comes to Epstein and basically says, “I heard that they’re raising. Can you get information from Morgan Stanley?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epstein turns around and passes that information back, and then you see this discussion about, okay, well, Morgan Stanley says Ford — which was reported at the time — had kind of an investment offer, potential acquisition offer, on the table for Lucid Motors [and] was going to come in in that Series D. And they’re chopping up — do we invest in this and maybe get a big return down the road? Or is it something that we sell as Ford comes in a couple months later, if we can get this stake now at fire sale prices?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, they didn’t go through with that, but Stern did eventually invest in Canoo and help get that company off the ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> One thing — maybe pulling back a little bit from the specific industries or investments — that’s also an important piece of context that generally gets mentioned in any of these stories about Epstein in Silicon Valley, but is worth repeating here, is that he [pleaded] guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Almost all the emails that we’re talking about with these stories [and] in pretty much any other story about Epstein in Silicon Valley comes after that. So it’s also partly a story about how people get comfortable with the idea that, okay, this guy has a pretty shady past already. He wasn’t the infamous criminal that he eventually [became], but there were things that were already known about him, and because he was a source of connections to power, to famous names, to money, a lot of people were just willing to look past that.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why top talent is walking away from OpenAI and xAI | Equity Podcast\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K3w3skyzZg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Launched in 2023, the accelerator has an acceptance rate of less than 1%. In a <a href=\"https://speedrun.substack.com/p/what-we-look-for-in-applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">January blog post,</a> the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The program <a href=\"https://speedrun.a16z.com/the-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invests up to $1 million</a> into each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, Y Combinator <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/deal\">typically takes a fixed 7% </a>of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 “invested on an uncapped MFN safe.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications for <a href=\"https://speedrun.a16z.com/apply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the next cohort open in April,</a> though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-on-the-founding-team-nbsp-nbsp\">Focus on the founding team  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speedrun focuses on early-stage startups. Because of this, they really examine who is on the founding team and whether their skills complement each other, Lu said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That doesn’t mean one has to be technical and one has to be commercial and one has to be marketing,” Lu said. It means that “we prefer not to see any glaring holes in capabilities or interests. We want the founding team to be self-aware and for that to be part of the hiring plan.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also like to see teams that have worked together before or have a shared history. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are lots of things that a founding team has to navigate in their startup journey and having a bit of pattern recognition, being able to work with each other, knowing how to disagree and how to come out the other side of a disagreement, those are all things people on founding teams with shared histories have an easier time with, on average,” he continued. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though AI has lowered the barriers to building software, it’s still incredibly helpful for a founding team to be technical, Lu said. At the same time, because AI has made it much faster to build and validate hypotheses and get a product out there, Lu said the Speedrun team likes to see when a startup already has a little bit of market validation or traction for their product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Speedrun as a program is really great at helping teams pour gasoline on a very small spark or fire,” he said. “We look for teams that have endeavored to build and try to show us that there’s a little spark we can fan the flames on.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-limit-the-market-theory\">Limit the market “theory”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu said one common mistake founders often make in the application process is spending too much energy talking about the market theory or why there is a defined problem and why their solution is the right one. “All of that may be true,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, he added, even the biggest, most successful tech companies faced unexpected blockades when they were young, sometimes even pivoting completely. What a company thinks it’s going to build at the beginning isn’t necessarily what will make it successful at the end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What we really want to hear about is why this founding team is really good together,” he continued, “why they’re a great founding team, the best possible founding team to solve this particular problem.” And then on top of that, any validation on the idea itself. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-okay-to-use-ai-for-the-application-but\">It’s okay to use AI for the application, but…</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu said the program encourages every founder to use AI to “clean up” their application. He said there is now no excuse for grammar errors or misspellings given the rising sophistication of AI tools. He also said AI can help founders sort out their thoughts, making them clearer, more concise, and more coherent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if AI did all the work in explaining the startup, that may backfire. If a founder makes it to the next round, it will be a live video-call interview. “At that point, their live narration explanation skills are going to be put to the test,” he said. So founders should be prepared to talk cogently about their startup without the help of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Only about 10% of founders make it to the video-call stage. There are typically two to three investors on the judging panel at a time. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the live interview, the team typically conducts a few more screening calls with the founders, and then a final decision on the cohort is made. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-be-greedy-to-network\">Be greedy to network</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are, of course, other accelerator programs for startups to choose from. Lu said Speedrun itself was inspired by some of these other programs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, he said, this accelerator prides itself on giving founders access to a large, specialized operating team. In fact, he said the best teams that get the most out of the program are the ones most “greedy about getting exposure to the amazing people and programs” Speedrun has to offer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lu listed off just a few points: a16z has around 600 people, and 10% of that staff is on the investment team, he said; everyone else is an operator who supports the companies the firm works with. As a result, founders in Speedrun will have access to experts who can help with marketing, banking, finance, management, and many other functions. So it helps to know who the startup wants to connect with and why. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We tell founders that come through the program, what you get out of Speedrun is what you put into it,” he said. “We think founders who want to take advantage of world experts in many different domains early in their startup journey would be really smart to choose us.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-advice-from-a-founder-in-the-program\">Advice from a founder in the program</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founder Mohamed Mohamed, who is in the recent cohort, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/proptech-startup-smart-bricks-raises-5-million-pre-seed-in-round-led-by-a16z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">just announced a $5 million raise</a> for his proptech startup Smart Bricks led by a16z’s Speedrun. He was attracted to the program because he said it stood out as one of the few “explicitly designed for co-founders working on frontier AI applications,” and he picked it because he wanted a program that would allow him to “stress-test an ambitious technical vision.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mohamed said he treated the application like an internal strategy memo rather than a pitch. “Instead of polishing buzzwords, we focused on clarity — the real problem, why it’s structurally hard, and why our team is unusually well-positioned to solve it,” he said. “We were explicit about what was working, what wasn’t, and where we needed help. I think that honesty and clear articulation of why this problem matters” is what helped the company in the application process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He called the whole process “rigorous but refreshingly thoughtful,” and said it was designed to understand how founders think, not just what they have built so far. “The conversations went deep into product architecture, data strategy, and long-term ambition. It felt closer to a partner-level discussion than a typical accelerator interview, which was a strong signal for us,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His overall advice is to be “intellectually honest and precise.” For example, he said in his application he avoided “over-optimizing” for the sake of hyping up his company. “If you’re vague, derivative, or overly defensive about your idea, it shows quickly. Don’t try to sound bigger than you are; clarity about where you actually are is far more compelling than inflated narratives,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the end, “Speedrun isn’t looking for perfect companies; they’re looking for founders who can reason clearly about complex problems and build with conviction,” he said. “Articulate the hard parts of what you’re doing and why they’re worth tackling. Depth beats polish every time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction, story originally misstated YC’s investment for its 7%.

And like Sora, Seedance quickly drew criticism for an apparent lack of guardrails around the ability to create videos using the likeness of real people, as well as studios’ intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After one X user <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134\">posted a brief video</a> showing Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, which they said was created by “a 2 line prompt in seedance 2,” “Deadpool” screenwriter <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/RhettReese/status/2021446414337966098\">Rhett Reese responded</a>, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Motion Picture Association soon issued <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.motionpictures.org/press/motion-picture-association-calls-for-bytedance-to-cease-seedance-2-0-infringing-activity/\">a statement</a> from CEO Charles Rivkin demanding that ByteDance “immediately cease its infringing activity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,” Rivkin said. “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Human Artistry Campaign — an initiative backed by Hollywood unions and trade groups — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/disneys-openai-deal-is-exclusive-for-just-one-year-then-its-open-season/\">condemned Seedance 2.0</a> as “an attack on every creator around the world,” while <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-seedance-20\">the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA said</a> it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by Bytedance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seedance videos have apparently featured Disney-owned characters such as Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and Grogu, better known as Baby Yoda, prompting the company to take legal action. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/disney-bytedance-seedance\">Axios reports that Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter</a> accusing ByteDance of a “virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP”and claiming the Chinese company is “hijacking Disney’s characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Disney isn’t necessarily opposed to working with AI companies — while it has reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-hits-google-with-cease-and-desist-claiming-massive-copyright-infringement/\">sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google</a> over similar issues, it has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/disneys-openai-deal-is-exclusive-for-just-one-year-then-its-open-season/\">signed a three-year licensing deal with OpenAI</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://variety.com/2026/digital/news/paramount-disney-bytedance-cease-and-desist-seedance-ai-infringement-ip-1236663663/\">Variety reports</a> that Paramount followed suit by sending Bytedance a cease-and-desist letter on Saturday.

For the first time since the dot-com crash, computer science enrollment dropped. System-wide, it fell <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/college-admissions/article/uc-major-computer-science-ai-21284464.php\">6% last year</a> after declining 3% in 2024, according to reporting this past week by the San Francisco Chronicle. Even as overall college enrollment <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nscresearchcenter.org/final-fall-enrollment-trends/\">climbed 2% nationally</a> — according to January data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center — students are bailing on traditional CS degrees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The one exception is UC San Diego  — the only UC campus that added a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://today.ucsd.edu/story/uc-san-diegos-new-ai-major-is-here\">dedicated AI major this fall</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This all might look like a temporary blip tied to news about fewer CS grads <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/10/the-computer-science-dream-has-become-a-nightmare/\">finding work out of college</a>. But it’s more likely an indicator of the future, one that China is much more enthusiastically embracing. As MIT Technology Review <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/28/1120747/chinese-universities-ai-use/\">reported last July</a>, Chinese universities have leaned hard into AI literacy, treating AI not as a threat but instead as essential infrastructure. Nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty now use AI tools multiple times daily, and schools like Zhejiang University have made AI coursework mandatory, while top institutions like Tsinghua have created entirely new interdisciplinary AI colleges. In China, fluency with AI isn’t optional anymore; it’s table stakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. universities are scrambling to catch up. Over the last two years, dozens have launched AI-specific programs. MIT’s “AI and decision-making” major is now the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://capd.mit.edu/blog/2025/12/04/mits-aid-major-becomes-one-of-the-institutes-most-popular-undergraduate-programs/\">second-largest major</a> on campus, says the school. As <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/technology/college-computer-science-ai-boom.html\">reported</a> by the New York Times in December, the University of South Florida enrolled more than <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://This%20semester,%20more%20than%203,000%20students%20enrolled%20in%20a%20new%20college%20of%20artificial%20intelligence%20and%20cybersecurity%20at%20the%20University%20of%20South%20Florida%20in%20Tampa\">3,000 students</a> in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://crowsneststpete.com/2025/09/29/usfs-bellini-college-launch-attracts-students-to-ai-and-cybersecurity-research/#:~:text=The%20college's%20goals%20include:%20*%20Improving%20the,college%20on%20the%20Tampa%20campus%20by%202028.\">new AI and cybersecurity college</a> during its fall semester. The University at Buffalo <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hesc.ny.gov/about/news-releases/governor-hochul-announces-first-their-kind-ai-specialized-degrees-offered\">last summer</a> launched a new “AI and Society” department that offers seven new, specialized undergraduate degree programs, and it received <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2025/12/University-at-Buffalo-solidifies-leadership-AI-data-science.html\">more than 200 applicants</a> before it swung open its doors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transition hasn’t been smooth everywhere. When I spoke with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/the-man-betting-everything-on-ai-and-bill-belichick/\">UNC Chapel Hill Chancellor Lee Roberts </a>in October, he described a spectrum — some faculty “leaning forward” with AI, others with “their heads in the sand.” Roberts, a former finance executive who arrived from outside academia, was pushing hard for AI integration despite faculty resistance. A week earlier, UNC had announced it would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.unc.edu/posts/2025/10/09/development-of-a-new-school-at-carolina/\">merge two schools</a> to create an AI-focused entity — a decision that drew faculty pushback. Roberts had also appointed a vice provost specifically for AI. “No one’s going to say to students after they graduate, ‘Do the best job you can, but if you use AI, you’ll be in trouble,’” Roberts told me. “Yet we have faculty members effectively saying that right now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parents are playing a role in this rocky transition, too. David Reynaldo, who runs the admissions consultancy College Zoom, told the Chronicle that parents who once pushed kids toward CS are now reflexively steering them toward other majors that seem more resistant to AI automation, including mechanical and electrical engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the enrollment numbers suggest students are voting with their feet. According to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cra.org/crn/2025/10/cerp-pulse-survey-a-snapshot-of-2025-undergraduate-computing-enrollment-patterns/\">survey</a> in October by the nonprofit Computing Research Association — its members include computer science and computer engineering departments from a wide range of universities — 62% of respondents reported that their computing programs saw undergraduate enrollment declines this fall. But with AI programs ballooning, it’s looking less like a tech exodus and more like a migration. The University of Southern California is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkj7qOeSte4#\">launching an AI degree</a> this coming fall; so are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/about/news/columbia-engineering-announces-new-program-master-science-artificial-intelligence#:~:text=The%20mix%20of%20backgrounds%20will,success%20in%20their%20chosen%20field.%E2%80%9D\">Columbia University</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pace.edu/news/press-release-pace-university-launch-bachelor-of-science-artificial-intelligence-fall-2026\">Pace University</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.nmsu.edu/news/nmsu-introduces-new-institute--degrees-in-artificial-intelligence/s/57adb5a5-de63-4659-8daa-fb7759372e5b\">New Mexico State University</a>, among many others. Students aren’t abandoning tech; they’re choosing programs focused on AI instead to land work.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s too soon to say whether this recalibration is permanent or a temporary panic or a near-term solution to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/03/ai-economy-labor-market-transformation/685731/\">longer-term challenge</a>. But it’s certainly a wake-up call for administrators who’ve spent years wrestling with how to handle AI in the classroom. The debate over whether to ban ChatGPT is ancient history at this point. The question now is whether American universities can move fast enough or whether they’ll keep arguing about what to do while students transfer to schools that already have answers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Echoing past comments, Google said that it informs users of these subpoenas when it can, and that it pushes back when the subpoenas are “overbroad.”</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of Silicon Valley has spent years chasing mega-rounds and buzzy AI deals. Meanwhile, Stacy Brown-Philpot is running Cherryrock Capital like a throwback to venture capital’s earlier days, writing smaller Series A and B checks to founders that larger firms routinely overlook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The former TaskRabbit CEO and decade-long Google veteran launched Cherryrock a year ago after seeing what she calls a persistent gap: access to capital for “underinvested entrepreneurs” building software companies at the crucial growth stage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I left TaskRabbit, I took some time off to figure out what was next and saw this gap in the market, which was access to capital, particularly for underinvested entrepreneurs,” Brown-Philpot told TechCrunch. She’d originally come to the Bay Area 25 years ago, planning to become a VC and even writing her Stanford Business School essay about it. After spending a decade at Google and leading TaskRabbit to a successful exit to IKEA, she’s finally back to that original plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She circled back to it for a reason. Before launching Cherryrock, Brown-Philpot was a member of the investment committee for the SoftBank Opportunity Fund, a $100 million vehicle started in 2020 to back underserved entrepreneurs. That experience proved there was no shortage of overlooked founders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SoftBank itself sold the Opportunity Fund to its leadership team in late 2023, divesting from the diversity-focused initiative. Brown-Philpot, meanwhile, doubled down, and launched her own fund. By the time she closed Cherryrock’s debut fund in February 2025, she already had more than 2,000 companies in her pipeline. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cherryrock is targeting 12 to 15 investments from its first fund — a concentrated approach and stark contrast to the seed funds that make dozens of bets, or massive funds that write nine-figure checks. Brown-Philpot’s also taking her time; a year after announcing the fund, she and her team, including cofounder Saydeah Howard, who spent nine years at the venture firm IVP, have backed just five companies, putting them about a third of the way toward their goal. In an era when many funds race to deploy capital almost as quickly as it’s raised, Brown-Philpot’s measured pace is another throwback to an earlier generation of VCs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown-Philpot’s focus on “underinvested” founders — a careful choice of words in today’s political climate — means backing entrepreneurs who might not fit the typical Silicon Valley mold.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked directly about the current political environment, where DEI has become a lightning rod, Brown-Philpot is unfazed. “It doesn’t change the pitch at all,” she said. “When we look at the people who decided to back Cherryrock, like JPMorgan and Bank of America…these are financial institutions who expect to generate a return. Our job as investors is to do just that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to those investors, Cherryrock’s LP roster includes Goldman Sachs Asset Management, MassMutual, Top Tier Capital Partners, and Melinda Gates’s Pivotal Ventures. Some of these have stepped back from explicit diversity pledges amid pressure from the Trump administration. Yet Brown-Philpot may find herself in an unexpectedly advantageous position. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cooley.com/news/insight/2024/2024-12-03-californias-broad-venture-capital-diversity-reporting-law-amended-to-now-take-effect-in-2026\">diversity reporting law</a> in California requires VC firms with a California nexus to report demographic data on their portfolio companies’ founding teams, with the first deadline in April. Unlike some corporate diversity initiatives that have faced legal challenges, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.littler.com/news-analysis/asap/california-doubles-down-diversity-data-new-era-dei-transparency-venture-capital\">the law</a> focuses on transparency rather than mandates, requiring reporting but not quotas. For a firm like Cherryrock that’s already tracking and prioritizing investments in diverse founders, compliance is “table stakes,” as Brown-Philpot puts it. “You accomplish what you measure.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown-Philpot’s perspective is informed by her vantage point across multiple institutions. Beyond Cherryrock, she sits on the boards of HP, StockX, and Stanford University — roles that give her insight into both enterprise buyers and the next generation of founders. At Stanford, she’s watching students navigate questions about AI’s impact on employment. “What I see on campus is the students are charting a path and finding a way to create opportunities for themselves,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her portfolio reflects her thesis. One investment is Coactive AI, led by Cody Coleman, an MIT grad with advanced degrees in philosophy and engineering from MIT and Stanford. The company provides multimodal AI infrastructure to the media and entertainment industry, a sector now under intense scrutiny following controversies around AI-generated content. Cherryrock led Coactive’s Series B alongside Emerson Collective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another bet is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pitch-deck-vitable-health-raise-16-million-2024-7\">Vitable Health</a>, founded by Joseph Kitonga, a Thiel Fellow and Y Combinator alum. The Philadelphia-based company provides on-demand, primary care-based health insurance to employers and hourly workers – the kind of population Brown-Philpot came to know well as the CEO of TaskRabbit during its last years as a standalone company. Kitonga “is the exact kind of founder that we want to back,” Brown-Philpot said. “He does what he says he’s going to do.” Brown-Philpot first invested at the seed stage of Vitable through her work with the SoftBank Opportunity Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked about her operating philosophy, Brown-Philpot is pragmatic about exits. “It’s very difficult to go public,” she said. “Most companies don’t go public, they do get acquired.” It’s a refreshingly honest take in an industry that often overpromises on IPO prospects. She points to TaskRabbit’s sale to IKEA as proof that the right acquisition can create lasting value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for 2026, Brown-Philpot’s priority is simple: “We are actively deploying capital.” She’s looking for Series A and B companies that have achieved product-market fit at scale, letting founders define what that means. And while the broader venture ecosystem debates the future of diversity initiatives, she is focused on finding great founders, wherever they are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m from Detroit,” she says. “Hard things are hard, but we know how to do hard things.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
