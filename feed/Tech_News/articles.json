            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modern enterprises generate enormous amounts of security data, but legacy tools like Splunk still require companies to store all of it in one place before they can detect threats – a slow and costly process that’s increasingly breaking down in cloud environments where volumes are exploding and data lives everywhere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI cybersecurity startup Vega Security wants to flip that approach by running security where the data already lives, implementing in cloud services, data lakes, and existing storage systems. And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Led by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega’s valuation to $700M and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef out its go-to-market team, and expand globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military’s cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/intel-confirms-acquisition-of-granulate-reportedly-for-up-to-650m-bringing-ai-based-workload-optimization-into-its-fold/\">Intel acquired for $650 million</a> in 2022. After a year at Intel, Sandler decided to “do it big time in the cybersecurity world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That pedigree is partly what attracted the attention of Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel. But it was also Vega’s ambitious approach to security management in a market that is already dominated by one player: Splunk.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brasoveanu told TechCrunch that legacy SIEM companies like Splunk, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/cisco-to-acquire-splunk-in-28b-mega-deal/\">Cisco acquired in 2024</a> for $28 billion, have been criticized in recent years because their solutions are difficult to scale. They fail at processing the insane rise of data volumes driven by AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Splunk and every contender since has always centralized the data, but by doing that you essentially hold the customer hostage,” Brasoveanu said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, sometimes it’s easier to hate the status quo than do the work of making a switch to a better alternative, a quandary any startup attempting to breach enterprise budgets understands. That’s why Sandler says Vega’s “North Star” was to not only build a solution that is more cost effective and better at threat detection, but “to make it no drama, as simple as possible for the biggest, most complex enterprises in the world to adopt it within minutes.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vega’s approach seems to be working. The 100-person startup has already signed multi-million-dollar contracts with banks, healthcare companies, and Fortune 500 firms, including cloud-heavy companies like Instacart. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only reason they would do that with a two-year-old startup is because the problem is so painful and other solutions on the market require an unrealistic expectation that the enterprise change the way they operate or do two years of data migrations,” Sandler said. “Vega enables them to just plug and play and achieve immediate detection response value.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/how-would-the-netflix-warner-bros-deal-reshape-hollywood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disrupt Hollywood</a> as we know it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix–WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-happened-so-far\">What has happened so far?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) <a href=\"https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revealed it was exploring a potential sale</a> after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/tv-burdened-wbd-will-struggle-cut-cord-2025-06-05/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declining cable viewership</a> and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/david-ellisons-paramount-seen-front-runner-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paramount</a> initially viewed as the frontrunner. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But ultimately, WBD’s board determined that Netflix’s offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount’s bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix’s offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Netflix recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/netflix-revises-offer-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-stave-off-paramount/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">amended its agreement</a> to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-fierce-bidding-war\">A fierce bidding war</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.’ assets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD</a> for several months. Still, the board repeatedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rejected</a> its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/paramount-files-lawsuit-against-warner-bros-amidst-controversial-netflix-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed a lawsuit</a> seeking more information about the Netflix deal.  A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-enhances-its-superior-30-per-share-all-cash-offer-for-warner-bros-discovery-and-provides-update-on-regulatory-progress-302683694.html?tc=eml_cleartime\">announcing </a>it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Netflix backs out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company continues to assert that its offer is far superior.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-regulatory-hurdles\">Regulatory hurdles</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"render of the US Capitol dome on red background\" class=\"wp-image-2024308\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the unprecedented scale and market impact of the deal, regulatory scrutiny is intense and remains a significant obstacle to closing the transaction. Earlier this week, it was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/netflix-s-sarandos-to-testify-in-senate-hearing-on-warner-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division</a>, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/netflix-s-5-8-billion-breakup-fee-for-warner-among-largest-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$5.8 billion breakup fee</a>. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-concerns-within-the-industry\">Concerns within the industry</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. <a href=\"https://www.wgaeast.org/wga-statement-on-the-acquisition-of-warner-bros-discovery-by-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Writers Guild of America</a> has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told. There are also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">widespread concerns about potential job losses</a> and lower wages. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For creators and theaters, uncertainty remains around release windows. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has stated that all films planned for theatrical release through Warner Bros. will continue as scheduled. However, he also hinted that, over time, release windows may be shortened, with movies coming to streaming platforms sooner than before.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-should-subscribers-know\">What should subscribers know?</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"netflix logo on black screen backlit by red glow\" class=\"wp-image-2352994\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg 869w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Thibault Penin / Unsplash</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​What does all this mean if you’re a Netflix or HBO Max subscriber? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix executives have reassured viewers that HBO’s operations will remain largely unchanged in the near term.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, is looking to repeal the 2009 “endangerment finding” that found greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and welfare, possibly as early as this week, the Wall Street Journal <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-to-repeal-landmark-climate-finding-in-huge-regulatory-rollback-ff7d58db?mod=hp_lead_pos1%5D\">reports</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EPA finding had set the legal basis for federal regulation of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, and it has been unsuccessfully challenged since it was first instituted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move is almost certain to attract a number of lawsuits, and it could be years before the matter is settled. The EPA’s move will only affect tailpipe emissions for cars and trucks, though it’s expected that the Trump administration will use it to unwind regulations in other sectors like power plants and industrial facilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Legacy automakers, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/trump-administration-rolls-back-fuel-economy-standards-again/\">pushed Trump to weaken fuel efficiency rules</a>, notably did not push for the EPA to repeal the endangerment finding. Tesla went further, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/tesla-asks-epa-not-to-roll-back-emissions-rules-as-trump-calls-climate-change-a-con-job/\">asking the EPA to maintain the finding</a>, saying it was “based on a robust factual and scientific record.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the Trump administration is successful, the U.S. will be increasingly out of step with regulations in other advanced economies. Companies that do business across borders will need to develop different approaches for each market, increasing costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automakers, in particular, are facing a future in which they’ll be forced to serve bifurcated markets, at least in the near term. Regulatory whiplash in the U.S. coupled with increasing competition from China has cost automakers <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/global-carmakers-book-55-billion-hit-ev-rollback-2026-02-06/\">tens of billions of dollars</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">American automakers’ reliance on fossil fuel-powered trucks, in particular, has painted the domestic industry into a corner, providing addictive profits that distract from future-proofing their fleets in advance of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2026-02-09/chinese-cars-are-coming-to-the-us-like-it-or-not\">seemingly inevitable</a> competition from Chinese marques.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration told the WSJ it expects the policy change to save more than $1 trillion, though it didn’t provide any evidence to back that figure up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Climate change is expected to cost far more. The Congressional Budget Office found that nearly $1 trillion worth of real estate is threatened by rising sea levels, and mortality rates in the U.S. could be <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61146\">2% higher if global warming isn’t abated</a>. Another study, published in 2024, found that climate change could <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-change-damage-could-cost-38-trillion-per-year-by-2050-study-finds-2024-04-17/\">trim global GDP by 17%</a> by 2050, the equivalent of $38 trillion per year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Back in June, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/youtube-says-its-ecosystem-created-490k-jobs-and-added-55b-to-the-us-gdp-in-2024/\">reported </a>that its creative ecosystem added over $55 billion to the U.S. GDP and created more than 490,000 full-time jobs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, many YouTubers have reduced their reliance on ad revenue and brand deals. There are several reasons for this shift. First, ad revenue can be unpredictable. With YouTube continually updating its policies, some creators find it challenging to secure ads for their videos, which can negatively impact their earnings. They’ve also realized that income from these streams can vanish unexpectedly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recognizing the volatility of platform-dependent revenue, many YouTubers are no longer just creators. They’re vertically integrated media companies with parallel businesses, including product lines, brick-and-mortar ventures, and consumer brands that can outlast algorithm changes and policy shifts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some cases, these side businesses are growing faster and more sustainably than their YouTube channels.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mrbeast\">MrBeast</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3042065\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=768,622 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=680,551 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=430,348 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=720,583 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=900,729 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=800,648 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=668,541 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=463,375 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=762,617 762w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=656,531 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beast-Games-Suit-Arms-Crossed.jpg?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Beast Industries</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jimmy Donaldson, known as MrBeast, who has 442 million subscribers, isn’t just one of the platform’s biggest creators — he’s its most aggressive entrepreneur. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2025, for example, The Times <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/mr-beast-theme-park-beast-land-saudi-arabia-lsff6t2b8\">reported</a> that the YouTuber is set to open a theme park in Saudi Arabia, with rides inspired by his video content. Among other features, there will supposedly be a game where six players stand on trap doors and must press a button when it lights up or fall down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MrBeast is also venturing into telecommunications. He plans to establish a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), which could involve partnering with one of the major operators, such as AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, or Verizon. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the YouTuber was spotted filing a trademark application for a mobile app that offers banking, financial advisory, and crypto exchange services. In February 2026, MrBeast announced the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/mrbeasts-company-buys-gen-z-focused-fintech-app-step/\">acquisition of Step</a>, the banking app targeted toward Gen Z users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there’s so much more. What started with a merchandise store in 2018 — ShopMrBeast — has exploded into a broad business portfolio, including his now three-year-old snack brand, Feastables.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Feastables’ initial product was the “MrBeast Bar,” a chocolate bar that generated over <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-youtuber-mrbeast-feastables-uses-giveaways-data-to-sell-chocolate-2022-5\">$10 million</a> in sales within its first 72 hours, selling over 1 million bars at launch. As of today, Feastables is more profitable than his YouTube content and even his “Beast Games” competition series on Prime Video. In 2024, Feastables generated roughly <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/mrbeast-makes-more-money-from-feastables-chocolate-than-youtube\">$250 million</a> in revenue and over $20 million in profit, while his media business lost approximately $80 million. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other ventures include his packaged food brand Lunchly (co-founded with YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI), the toy line MrBeast Lab, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/youtube-star-mrbeast-sues-ghost-kitchen-behind-mrbeast-burger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MrBeast Burger</a>, and the analytics platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/14/mrbeasts-analytics-platform-viewstats-is-out-in-beta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Viewstats</a>.

Hauler Hero has raised more than $27 million in venture capital, to date.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hauler Hero has developed an all-in-one software platform for waste management companies that covers a variety of functions, including customer relationship management, billing, and routing. And now, like so many other software companies, Hauler Hero plans to offer AI agents to its customers as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hauler Hero was co-founded in 2020 by CEO Mark Hoadley and brother-in-law Ben Sikma, who encountered outdated software while working on mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Their aim was to bring waste management into the modern era.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of the existing software in the space, they were clunky, old,” Hoadley told TechCrunch in 2024. “Sometimes we’d talk about how this one reminds us of the Oregon Trail, this reminds us of the cell phone Michael Douglas used in ‘Wall Street.’ They’re very clunky and antiquated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers suggest the company has had some success; Hauler Hero said it has helped facilitate 35 million trash pickups since inception in 2020. And it continues to grow, according to Hoadley, who told TechCrunch the company has doubled its head count, revenue and customer base since announcing its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/hauler-hero-wants-to-bring-waste-management-software-into-the-21st-century/\">seed round in late 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hauler Hero has added new features to its platform since its seed round, Hoadley said. The most notable is a product that captures images from third-party cameras on garbage trucks and send them directly to a software command center. This information helps waste management companies confirm pickups, verify billing, and keep a better eye on their distributed fleet, according to the company.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hoadley said some sanitation workers, and their respective unions, don’t love this tech upgrade. But he added that most unions prevent the footage from being used against the drivers for disciplinary measures, for example, and that the images can actually help reduce liability for drivers in accidents or if they are accused of missing a pickup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think of it as like running a factory with no roof and no visibility into what’s happening in that factory,” Hoadley said. “If you don’t have visibility into what’s happening out there, it’s very hard to have quality control. And the quality control in this case is what was out there, was it picked up?”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-trio-of-ai-agents\">A trio of AI agents</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hauler Hero is now working to develop and deploy a set of three AI agents. One, Hero Vision, is focused on automatically identifying service issues and revenue opportunities. Hero Chat is a chatbot for customer inquiries. Hero Route will use route data to automatically adjust routes to make them more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s an enormous amount of data in our system about pickups, work orders, billing information, and if you give these agents an understanding of your data model, you can just go tell them, hey, go build me a chart,” Hoadley said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hauler Hero plans to use some of its recent funding to commercialize these agents in addition to bulking up its offerings for municipal entities, a growing group of the company’s customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It wasn’t something that I necessarily thought was going to be part of this journey,” Hoadley said about working with these public entities. “It kind of came organically as many things do. We just had inbound from some municipalities and eventually we sold one of them and then we sold another.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hoadley said that he thinks some of that demand is driven by the fact that its two main competitors, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wastedive.com/news/routeware-acquires-recently-spun-off-rubicon-fleet-tech-business/725404/\">Routeware and Wastech</a>, merged in 2024, leaving government entities with little choice of providers to work with. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hoadley said the company is now focused on fine-tuning and scaling its product — and maybe a some new additions as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re going to continue to chart the course for the next decade of being at the cutting edge of delivering value for customers, leveraging all the latest tools,” Hoadley said. “There’s a lot more fun things and valuable things that we can do for our customers, and we’re really excited about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece has been updated to better reflect which investors participated in the Series A. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a move that could reshape how global tech firms moderate content in one of the world’s largest and fastest growing market for internet services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes, <a href=\"https://egazette.gov.in/(S(0ct2e1fwl2vycvmqacrzmxxm))/ViewPDF.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published</a> (PDF) on Tuesday as amendments to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">India’s 2021 IT Rules</a>, bring deepfakes under a formal regulatory framework, mandating the labelling and traceability of synthetic audio and visual content, while also slashing compliance timelines for platforms, including a three-hour deadline for official takedown orders and a two-hour window for certain urgent user complaints.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s importance as a digital market amplifies the impact of the new rules. With over a billion internet users and a predominantly young population, the South Asian nation is a critical market for platforms like Meta and YouTube, making it likely that compliance measures adopted in India will influence global product and moderation practices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the amended rules, social media platforms that allow users to upload or share audio-visual content must require disclosures on whether material is synthetically generated, deploy tools to verify those claims, and ensure that deepfakes are clearly labelled and embedded with traceable provenance data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Certain categories of synthetic content — including deceptive impersonations, non-consensual intimate imagery, and material linked to serious crimes — are barred outright in the rules. Non-compliance, particularly in cases flagged by authorities or users, can expose companies to greater legal liability by jeopardising their safe-harbour protections under Indian law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rules lean heavily on automated systems to meet those obligations. Platforms are expected to deploy technical tools to verify user disclosures, identify, and label deepfakes, and prevent the creation or sharing of prohibited synthetic content in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The amended IT Rules mark a more calibrated approach to regulating AI-generated deepfakes,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner at New Delhi-based policy consulting firm The Quantum Hub. “The significantly compressed grievance timelines — such as the two- to three-hour takedown windows — will materially raise compliance burdens and merit close scrutiny, particularly given that non-compliance is linked to the loss of safe harbour protections.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aprajita Rana, a partner at AZB &amp; Partners, a leading Indian corporate law firm, said the rules now focus on AI-generated audio-visual content rather than all online information, while carving out exceptions for routine, cosmetic or efficiency-related uses of AI. However, she cautioned that the requirement for intermediaries to remove content within three hours once they become aware of it departs from established free-speech principles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The law, however, continues to require intermediaries to remove content upon being aware or receiving actual knowledge, that too within three hours,” Rana said, adding that the labelling requirements would apply across formats to curb the spread of child sexual abuse material and deceptive content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New Delhi-based digital advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation <a href=\"https://x.com/internetfreedom/status/2021229955217228082\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> the rules risk accelerating censorship by drastically compressing takedown timelines, leaving little scope for human review and pushing platforms toward automated over-removal. In a statement posted on X, the group also raised concerns about the expansion of prohibited content categories and provisions that allow platforms to disclose the identities of users to private complainants without judicial oversight.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These impossibly short timelines eliminate any meaningful human review,” the group said, warning that the changes could undermine free-speech protections and due process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two industry sources told TechCrunch that the amendments followed a limited consultation process, with only a narrow set of suggestions reflected in the final rules. While the Indian government appears to have taken on board proposals to narrow the scope of information covered — focusing on AI-generated audio-visual content rather than all online material — other recommendations were not adopted. The scale of changes between the draft and final rules warranted another round of consultation to give companies clearer guidance on compliance expectations, the sources said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Government takedown powers have already been a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/india/india-accused-of-censorship-for-blocking-social-media-criticism-amid-covid-surge-11619435006\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">point of contention</a> in India. Social media platforms and civil-society groups have long criticized the <a href=\"https://x.com/apar1984/status/1757431828124995804\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">breadth and opacity of content removal orders</a>, and even Elon Musk’s X <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/x-sues-india-over-unrestrained-censorship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">challenged New Delhi in court</a> over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/elon-musk-x-to-withhold-specific-accounts-and-tweets-in-india-to-comply-with-executive-orders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">directives to block or remove posts</a>, arguing that they amounted to overreach and lacked adequate safeguards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta, Google, Snap, X, and the Indian IT ministry did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest changes come just months after the Indian government, in October 2025, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/india-limits-content-takedown-powers-fewer-officials-after-spat-with-musks-x-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reduced</a> the number of officials authorized to order content removals from the internet in response to a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/x-says-will-fight-indian-court-ruling-on-content-takedown-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legal challenge by X</a> over the scope and transparency of takedown powers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The amended rules will come into effect on February 20, giving platforms little time to adjust compliance systems.

The startup, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://entire.io\">Entire</a>, has raised $60 million at a $300 million valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Entire offers an open source tool to help developers better manage code written by AI agents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Entire’s tech has three components. One is a git-compatible database to unify the AI-produced code. Git is a distributed version control system popular with enterprises and used by open source sites like GitHub and GitLab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another component is what it calls “a universal semantic reasoning layer” intended to allow multiple AI agents to work together. The final piece is an AI-native user interface designed with agent-to-human collaboration in mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first product Entire is releasing is an open-source tool it calls Checkpoints that automatically pairs every bit of software the agent submits for use in a software project with the context that created it, including prompts and transcripts. The idea is to allow the human developer to review, search, and perhaps even learn from why the AI did what it did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Entire hopes to help developers better deal with the large volumes of software created by AI coding agents. Popular open-source projects are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/4129056/is-ai-killing-open-source.html\">particularly overwhelmed these days with suggested code contributions</a> that may or may not be AI slop — meaning poorly designed and possibly unusable code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dohmke explains in the press release: “We are living through an agent boom, and now massive volumes of code are being generated faster than any human could reasonably understand. The truth is, our manual system of software production — from issues, to git repositories, to pull requests, to deployment — was never designed for the era of AI in the first place.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dohmke was CEO of Microsoft’s GitHub for four years, leaving in August 2025 to found a startup, he said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ashtom/status/1954920157853172064\">post</a> on X at the time.

It perhaps showcases how the size of early-stage rounds has dramatically increased in the age of AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ben Sun, a co-founder and general partner at Primary Ventures, told TechCrunch the average check size for this fund will range from $5 million to $10 million, and that he hopes the firm will invest in 40 to 50 companies over the course of three years. He said the fund will also go as early as pre-seed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund will also continue to spread its investments nationwide. Primary is one of New York’s most well-known venture firms, and at one point, most of its investments were focused in the Big Apple. Sun said the location thesis has changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm, which overall focuses on early-stage investing, has now done deals in Chicago, Seattle, Virginia, and D.C. “The talent, the founder, and the startups are happening everywhere,” he said. “The potential outcomes are so much bigger than they’ve ever been.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He sees seed investing as headed toward its own asset class, especially as the quality of talent and their startups continue to rise, paired with tech’s current transformation. Firms are competing, after all, to find the hottest deals. “I think [a fund of this size] allows you to go in and compete and bring more resources to the table to work with the best founders and opportunities.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sequoia also recently raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/sequoia-unveils-950m-in-new-early-stage-funds-as-it-strives-to-be-only-as-good-as-our-next-investment/\">$200 million seed fund, </a>as did UnCorck Capital, which announced <span>a </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uncork-capital-raises-300-million-to-back-the-next-generation-of-category-defining-companies-302443713.html\"><span>$2</span>25 million seed fund</a> earlier last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Primary calls itself a generalist, Sun said the firm has sector specialists, each with their own focus.

Even after a deal has been brokered, Smart Bricks uses fresh data to continuously update the deal, monitor performance, simulate refinancing, and recommend actions as the market changes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091105\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png 1995w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=1200,651 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=1280,695 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=430,233 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=720,391 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=900,489 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=800,434 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=1536,834 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=668,363 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=1137,617 1137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=708,384 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Smart-Bricks-product-imagry.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced Tuesday a $5 million pre-seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz.

The startup is also currently partaking in a16z’s prestigious Speedrun program. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mohamed met the team at a16z last year while exhibiting at TechCrunch Disrupt. At the time, he said, the company was still under the radar, but the investment from a16z has allowed them to scale. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh capital will be used to expand the product’s infrastructure into additional markets (right now it just operates in the U.S., UK, and the UAE, the latter of which is Mohamed’s home country). The money will also go toward product advancement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mohamed said the last wave of proptech didn’t focus enough on the sector’s true bottleneck: cognition and execution. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Real estate transactions are slow and opaque because the reasoning lives in people’s heads and the process spans too many disconnected systems,” he said, adding that the company is betting that the next era of proptech looks like what happened in the public markets — “intelligence layers, automated execution, and continuous decision-making powered by software,” he continued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Smart Bricks is building the AI infrastructure that allows real estate to operate more like a modern financial system, even across borders,” Mohamed said</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in this space include reAlpha and RoofStock. Mohammed said Smart Bricks is different because others are building on top of a tech stack, but this product has built the stack itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re closer to what Bloomberg did for public markets or what algorithmic trading platforms did for equities than to a consumer property portal,” he said. “The goal is not to show more options, but to enable better outcomes through autonomous reasoning systems.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While the company has historically built a strong customer base in media, entertainment, and advertising –  including a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/12/adobe-and-runway-partner\">recent partnership with Adobe</a> – a spokesperson told TechCrunch that Runway is increasingly seeing adoption in gaming and robotics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Runway’s shift comes amid intensifying competition among labs pursuing world models. Rivals include Fei-Fei Li’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\">World Labs</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/i-built-marshmallow-castles-in-googles-new-ai-world-generator-project-genie/\">Google DeepMind</a>, both of which recently made their models publicly available. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding follows the release of Gen 4.5, Runway’s latest video generation model. Gen 4.5 allows users to generate high-definition videos from text prompts and introduces native audio, longform, multi-shot generation capabilities, character consistency, and advanced editing tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model has earned Runway significant credibility within the AI industry after outperforming video generation offerings from both Google and OpenAI on several benchmarks — a milestone that likely factored into investor interest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond model development, Runway has also been expanding its infrastructure. The company recently signed a deal with CoreWeave to expand its compute capacity, a move that may have helped reassure investors about Runway’s ability to operate in a highly compute-intensive space. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, Runway plans to use the new capital to rapidly expand its roughly 140-person team across research, engineering, and go-to-market, according to a company spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was led by General Atlantic with participation from Nvidia, Fidelity Management &amp; Research, AllianceBernstein, Adobe Ventures, Mirae Asset, Emphatic Capital, Felicis, Premji, and AMD Ventures.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s that AI will save you from it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the version the industry has spent the last three years selling to millions of nervous people who are eager to buy it. Yes, some white-collar jobs will disappear. But for most other roles, the argument goes, AI is a force multiplier. You become a more capable, more indispensable lawyer, consultant, writer, coder, financial analyst — and so on. The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it\">new study</a> published in Harvard Business Review follows that premise to its actual conclusion, and what it finds there isn’t a productivity revolution. It finds companies are at risk of becoming burnout machines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of what they describe as “in-progress research,” UC Berkeley researchers spent eight months inside a 200-person tech company watching what happened when workers genuinely embraced AI. What they found across more than 40 “in-depth” interviews was that nobody was pressured at this company. Nobody was told to hit new targets. People just started doing more because the tools made more feel doable. But because they could do these things, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees’ to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As one engineer told them, “You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less. But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over on the tech industry forum Hacker News, one commenter had the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945755\">same reaction</a>, writing, “I feel this. Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s fascinating and also alarming. The argument about AI and work has always stalled on the same question — are the gains real? But too few have stopped to ask what happens when they are.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers’ new findings aren’t entirely novel. A separate trial last summer found experienced developers using AI tools took <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/\">19% longer on tasks</a> while believing they were 20% faster. Around the same time, a National Bureau of Economic Research study tracking AI adoption across thousands of workplaces found that productivity gains amounted to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w33777\">just 3% in time savings</a>, with no significant impact on earnings or hours worked in any occupation. Both studies have gotten picked apart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This one may be harder to dismiss because it doesn’t challenge the premise that AI can augment what employees can do on their own. It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry bet that helping people do more would be the answer to everything, but it may turn out to be the beginning of a different problem entirely. The research is worth reading, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company has signed up more than 2,600 business customers throughout the U.K. on the promise that buying energy from its utility division can save them up to 30% on their energy bills.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup recently closed an oversubscribed $75 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from AlbionVC, Allianz, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Revent, Schroders Capital, and Voyager Ventures, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round values Tem at more than $300 million, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. The startup plans to use the funding to help expand to Australia and the U.S., starting with Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in a nice position where we kind of have control over our own profitability. So I could have chosen not to raise at all and had a lovely, nice bootstrap business in some ways,” Joe McDonald, co-founder and CEO of Tem, told TechCrunch. “Well, we’re not that kind of business. We know what we want to achieve as someone who wants to go public over the years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tem is a classic marketplace play, matching electricity generators with consumers. The company intentionally started by focusing almost exclusively on renewable energy generators and small businesses to fill both sides of the ledger. “The more decentralized and the more distributed, the better it is for the algorithms,” McDonald said. “But this works all the way up to enterprise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s customers include fast-fashion retailer Boohoo Group, soft drink company Fever-Tree, and Newcastle United FC. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Tem is running what amounts to two different businesses. One, called Rosso, is the transaction engine that matches suppliers with buyers. Here, machine learning algorithms and LLMs help predict supply and demand. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal with Rosso, McDonald said, is to cut costs by eliminating several layers that are present in current energy markets. “In each of them, you’ve got different teams doing different jobs, taking different levels of profit from back office to trading, trading desks to other trading desks, and probably five to six intermediaries in total that enable the flow of money to move from one side to the other,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With AI, he said, “you now have an opportunity to replace the humans, the labor costs, and the disparate systems into one single transaction infrastructure.” The goal is to make the price that customers pay for electricity closer to the wholesale cost.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other part of Tem, called RED, is a “neo-utility” built to prove the value of Rosso. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we first started, we tried to sell our infrastructure to the energy companies, and we got nowhere,” he said. RED is currently the only utility using Rosso, and McDonald said its growth has pushed the company to prioritize it over opening Rosso to others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At some point, though, Tem plans to allow other utilities in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In reality, it doesn’t matter how good [RED] is; it’s not going to get above a 40% market share. And it shouldn’t, because that becomes a monopoly in itself. So, me, I’d much rather go to get access to all the transaction flow,” McDonald said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Long term, we really don’t mind who owns the customer, who owns the generation as long as our infrastructure is being used,” he said. “This is just an infrastructure play in the same way AWS was, or Stripe was.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Ahmedabad City Crime Branch has become the first police unit in India to integrate Aadhaar-based offline verification with PATHIK, a guest-monitoring platform launched by the police department, aimed at hotels and guest accommodations to record visitors’ information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UIDAI has also positioned the new Aadhaar app as a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/UIDAI/status/2019757027191582882\">digital visiting card</a> for meetings and networking, allowing users to share selected personal details via a QR code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Officials at the launch in New Delhi said these latest efforts are part of a broader effort to replace photocopies and manual ID checks with consent-based, offline verification. The approach, they argued, is meant to give users more control over which specific identity information they want to share, while enabling verification at scale without having to query Aadhaar’s central database.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-early-uptake-on-top-of-massive-scale\">Early uptake on top of massive scale</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While UIDAI formally launched the new Aadhaar app last month, it had been in testing since earlier in 2025. Estimates from Appfigures show that the app, which appeared in app stores toward the end of 2025, quickly overtook the older mAadhaar app in monthly downloads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Combined monthly installs of Aadhaar-related apps rose from close to 2 million in October to nearly 9 million in December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new app is being layered onto an identity system that already operates at enormous scale considering India’s population. Figures published on<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uidai.gov.in/aadhaar_dashboard/\"> UIDAI’s public dashboard</a> show that Aadhaar has issued more than 1.4 billion identity numbers and handles roughly 2.5 billion authentication transactions each month, alongside tens of billions of electronic “know your customer” checks since its launch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift toward offline verification does not replace this infrastructure so much as extending it, moving Aadhaar from a largely backend verification tool into a more visible and everyday interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the app’s launch, UIDAI officials said the move toward offline verification was intended to address long-standing risks <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/28/india-rajasthan-government-jan-aadhaar-bug-fix/\">associated with physical photocopies and screenshots of Aadhaar documents</a>, which have often been collected, stored, and circulated with little oversight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion comes at a time of regulatory changes, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/india-expands-aadhaar-authentication-for-businesses-raising-privacy-concerns/\">easing restrictions</a>, and a<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uidai.gov.in/images/OVSE_Playbook.pdf\"> new framework</a> (PDF), with UIDAI now allowing some public and private organizations to verify Aadhaar credentials without querying the central database. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consent-accountability-and-unresolved-risks\">Consent, accountability, and unresolved risks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Civil liberties and digital rights groups say those legal changes do not resolve Aadhaar’s deeper structural risks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raman Jit Singh Chima, senior international counsel and Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, said the expansion of Aadhaar into offline and private-sector settings introduces new threats, particularly at a time when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/07/india-digital-data-privacy-bill/\">India’s data protection framework</a> is still being put in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chima questioned the timing of the rollout, arguing that the federal government should have waited for India’s Data Protection Board to be established first, and allow for independent review and wider consultation with affected communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fact that this has gone ahead at this point of time seems to indicate a preference to continue the expansion of the use of Aadhaar, even if it is unclear in terms of the further risks that it might pose to the system, as well as to the data of Indians,” Chima told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indian legal advocacy groups also point to unresolved implementation failures. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prasanth Sugathan, legal director at New Delhi-based digital rights group SFLC.in, said that while UIDAI has framed the app as a tool for citizen empowerment, it does little to address persistent problems, such as inaccuracies in the Aadhaar database, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/security-bug-in-indias-income-tax-portal-exposed-taxpayers-sensitive-data/\">security lapses</a>, and poor mechanisms for redress, which have disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also cited a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cag-report-uidai-audit-aadhaar-data-7857808/\">2022 report</a> by India’s Comptroller and Auditor General, which found UIDAI had failed to meet certain compliance standards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Such issues can often result in disenfranchisement of people, especially those who were meant to be benefited by such systems,” Sugathan told TechCrunch, adding that it remains unclear how data shared through the new app would prevent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/13/aadhaar-leak-pm-kisan/\">breaches or leaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Campaigners associated with Rethink Aadhaar, a civil society campaign focused on Aadhaar-related rights and accountability, argue that the offline verification system risks reintroducing private-sector use of Aadhaar in ways the Supreme Court has already explicitly barred. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shruti Narayan and John Simte of the group said enabling private entities to routinely rely on Aadhaar for verification amounts to “Aadhaar creep”, normalizing its use across social and economic life despite a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sflc.in/key-highlights-aadhaar-judgment/\">2018 judgment</a> that struck down provisions allowing private actors to use Aadhaar to verify people’s information. They warned that consent in such contexts is often illusory, particularly in situations involving hotels, housing societies, or delivery workers, while India’s data protection law <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/india-data-law-surveillance-privacy-big-tech-data-protection-press-freedom/a-74923737\">remains largely untested</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Together, the new app, regulatory changes, and expanding ecosystem are shifting Aadhaar from a background identity utility into a visible layer of daily life that is increasingly hard to avoid. As India doubles down on Aadhaar, governments and tech companies are watching closely, attracted by the promise of population-scale identity checks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian IT ministry and UIDAI CEO did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Riders will initially hail rides directly through the Waymo app. Once the service expands, Waymo will also make its self-driving vehicles available through the Lyft app. Lyft has said it will handle fleet services, such as vehicle readiness and maintenance, charging infrastructure, and depot operations, through its wholly owned subsidiary Flexdrive.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has accelerated its robotaxi expansion and today operates commercial services in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Phoenix. It also has driverless test fleets in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company tends to follow the same rollout strategy in every new market, starting with a small fleet of vehicles that are manually driven to map the city. The autonomous vehicles are then tested with a human safety operator in the driver’s seat. Eventually, the company conducts driverless testing, often allowing employees to hail rides, before launching a robotaxi service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is the most-subscribed creator on YouTube, with over 466 million subscribers, but his ambitions stretch beyond his over-the-top videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,” the 27-year-old <a href=\"https://x.com/MrBeast/status/2020910218360782929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a>. “I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This acquisition makes sense, considering that a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/mrbeast-reportedly-plans-to-launch-a-phone-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">leaked pitch document</a> from last year showed this was an area of interest for Beast Industries.

What’s going to happen to all these companies? What’s AI going to do with all these companies?’ For us, it’s just increasing the usage,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be sure, he also wants to distance Databricks from the SaaS label, given that private markets value it as an AI company. Databricks on Monday also officially closed on its massive, previously announced $5 billion raise <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/databricks-raises-4b-at-134b-valuation-as-its-ai-business-heats-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">at a $134 billion valuation</a>, and nabbed a $2 billion loan facility as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the company is straddling both worlds. Databricks is still best known as a cloud data warehouse provider. A data warehouse is where enterprises store massive amounts of data to analyze for business insights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ghodsi called out, in particular, one AI product that’s driving usage of its data warehouse: its LLM user interface named Genie.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Genie is an example of how a SaaS business can <a href=\"https://x.com/buccocapital/status/2019598551228223526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">replace its user interface</a> with natural language. For instance, he uses it to ask why warehouse usage and revenue spike on particular days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just a few years ago, such a request required writing queries in a specific technical language, or having a special report programmed. Today, any product with an LLM interface can be used by anyone, Ghodsi noted. Genie is one reason for the company’s usage growth numbers, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The threat of AI to SaaS isn’t, as <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2019494196953154011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one AI VC jokingly tweeted</a>, that enterprises will rip out their SaaS “systems of record” to replace them with vibe-coded homegrown versions. Systems of record store critical business data, whether it’s on sales, customer support, or finance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Why would you move your system of record? You know, it’s hard to move it,” Ghodsi said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model makers aren’t offering databases to store that data and become systems of record anyway. Instead, they hope to replace the user interface with natural language for human use, or APIs or other plug-ins for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So the threat to SaaS businesses, Ghodsi says, is that people no longer spend their careers becoming masters of a particular product: Salesforce specialists, or ServiceNow, or SAP. Once the interface is just language, the products become invisible, like plumbing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Millions of people around the world got trained on those user interfaces. And so that was the biggest moat that those businesses have,” Ghodsi warned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SaaS companies that embrace the new LLM interface could grow, as Databricks is doing. But it also opens up possibilities for AI-native competitors to offer alternatives that work better with AI and agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Databricks created its Lakebase database designed for agents. He’s seeing early traction. “In its eight months that we’ve had it in the market, it’s done twice as much revenue as our data warehouse had when it was eight months old. Okay, obviously, that’s like comparing toddlers,” Ghodsi says. “But this is a toddler that’s twice as big.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, now that Databricks has closed on its massive funding round, Ghodsi tells us that the company is not immediately working on another raise, nor prepping for an IPO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now is not a great time to go public,” Ghodsi said. “I just wanted to be really well capitalized” should the markets go “south” again as they did in the 2022 downturn, when interest rates rose sharply after years of near-zero rates.
