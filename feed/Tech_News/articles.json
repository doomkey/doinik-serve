As a result, two mobile apps that offer a way to determine if products are made in America, then suggest local alternatives, have surged to the top of the Danish App Store in recent days. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Danish App Store serves users in both Greenland and Denmark, and the same is true for Google Play. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The boost in downloads comes as Danish consumers <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/after-canada-its-now-denmarks-turn-danes-boycott-american-products-ban-netflix-and-californian-wine/articleshow/119672584.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have been organizing a grassroots boycott</a> of American-made products, which also included canceling their U.S. vacations and ditching their subscriptions to U.S.-based streaming services, like Netflix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across both iOS and Android, two apps, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nonusa/id6742805777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NonUSA</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.i7evenaps.madeometer&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Made O’Meter,</a> have entered the top 10 this month, according to new data from market intelligence provider <a href=\"http://www.appfigures.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Appfigures</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NonUSA became the No. 1 app on Wednesday, after earlier jumping from No. 6 on Tuesday, up from No. 441 on January 9. This app is specifically designed to allow users to boycott American products in their everyday lives. To use the app, users scan product barcodes, then view the product’s origin information on their iPhone. It also suggests local Danish alternatives that users can purchase instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, the app’s top five markets are Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland, demonstrating a Nordic alliance in boycotting American products. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

the Danish App Store sees daily is quite small, compared to larger markets like the U.S. In Denmark, it could only take a few thousand downloads in a single day to reach the top of the App Store.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI detection startup <a href=\"https://gptzero.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GPTZero</a> scanned all <a href=\"https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/papers.html?filter=titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">4,841 papers</a> accepted by the prestigious Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), which took place last month in San Diego. The company found 100 hallucinated citations across 51 papers that it confirmed as fake, the company tells TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Having a paper accepted by NeurIPS is a résumé-worthy achievement in the world of AI. Given that these are the leading minds of AI research, one might assume they would use LLMs for the catastrophically boring task of writing citations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So caveats abound with this finding: 100 confirmed hallucinated citations across 51 papers is not statistically significant. Each paper has dozens of citations. So out of tens of thousands of citations, this is, statistically, zero. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also important to note that an inaccurate citation doesn’t negate the paper’s research. As NeurIPS told <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/21/neurips-ai-conferences-research-papers-hallucinations/?sge456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fortune</a>, which was first to report on GPTZero’s research, “Even if 1.1% of the papers have one or more incorrect references due to the use of LLMs, the content of the papers themselves [is] not necessarily invalidated.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But having said all that, a faked citation is not a nothing, either. NeurIPS prides itself on its “rigorous scholarly publishing in machine learning and artificial intelligence,” <a href=\"https://blog.neurips.cc/2025/12/15/supporting-our-communitys-infrastructure-neurips-foundations-donation-to-openreview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it says</a>. And each paper is peer-reviewed by multiple people who are instructed to flag hallucinations.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Citations are also a sort of currency for researchers. They are used as a career metric to show how influential a researcher’s work is among their peers. When AI makes them up, it waters down their value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No one can fault the peer reviewers for not catching a few AI-fabricated citations given the sheer volume involved. GPTZero is also quick to point this out. The goal of the exercise was to offer specific data on how AI slop sneaks in via “a submission tsunami” that has “strained these conferences’ review pipelines to the breaking point,” the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/21/neurips-ai-conferences-research-papers-hallucinations/?sge456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">startup says in its report</a>. GPTZero even points to a May 2025 paper called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04966\">“The AI Conference Peer Review Crisis”</a> that discussed the problem at premiere conferences, including NeurIPS. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, why couldn’t the researchers themselves fact-check the LLM’s work for accuracy? Surely they must know the actual list of papers they used for their work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What the whole thing really points to is one big, ironic takeaway: If the world’s leading AI experts, with their reputations at stake, can’t ensure their LLM usage is accurate in the details, what does that mean for the rest of us? </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s not immediately clear how long Blue Origin expects it will take to build out the whole network.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The low-Earth orbit satellites Blue Origin is building will use RF connectivity and have a max data transfer speed of 144 Gbps, while the medium-Earth variety will use an optical link that can achieve the much higher 6 Tbps speed. For reference, SpaceX’s Starlink currently maxes out at 400 Mbps — though it plans to launch upgraded satellites that will offer <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/big-win-for-spacex-as-fcc-clears-it-to-upgrade-starlink-with-gigabit-speeds?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&amp;test_variant=B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1 Gbps data transfer</a> in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“TeraWave adds a space-based layer to your existing network infrastructure, providing connectivity to locations unreachable by traditional methods,” the new website for the satellite network reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement of the TeraWave network comes just a few months after Bezos’ other company, Amazon, announced a rebrand of its own satellite network geared toward consumers. That network, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/16/amazon-satellite-network-gets-a-rebrand-and-drops-its-affordability-pitch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">called Leo</a>, will ultimately consist of around 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit and offers more traditional broadband speeds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taken together, these two networks could provide more robust competition to SpaceX’s Starlink, which has become the leading satellite internet provider with more than 9 million customers. Starlink currently sells its connectivity to regular consumers, commercial customers (like airlines), and governments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the two networks from Amazon and Blue Origin are distinct. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We identified an unmet need with customers who were seeking enterprise-grade internet access with higher speeds, symmetrical upload/download speeds, more redundancy, and rapid scalability for their networks. TeraWave solves for these problems,” Blue Origin said in a statement to TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blue Origin has spent years in development on a number of projects, and is best-known for the short trips to space it offers on its small New Shepard rocket. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has recently started to emerge as a multi-faceted commercial space player. In 2025, the company successfully launched its mega-rocket, New Glenn, for the first time and then repeated the feat months later. It also landed the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/blue-origin-sticks-first-new-glenn-rocket-landing-and-launches-nasa-spacecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">booster stage on just its second attempt</a>, and launched its first commercial payload for NASA.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to send a robotic lander to the surface of the moon this year on the <a href=\"https://x.com/blueorigin/status/2013686788167000239?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">third New Glenn launch</a>.

Several existing and new investors, including Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Valor Equity Partners, and Tiger Global participated in the funding round.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2014, Zipline developed its own drone delivery ecosystem, including the logistics software, launch and landing systems, and the aircraft. The company got its commercial start in 2016 using its autonomous drones to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/zipline-is-now-the-national-drone-service-provider-for-rwanda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deliver blood in Rwanda</a>. Today, Zipline’s drones deliver food, retail, agriculture, and health products in five African countries, several cities in the United States, and Japan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Zipline launched a home delivery service in the U.S. that lets customers order food and retail goods via an app. The home delivery service uses Zipline’s Platform 2 drones, which are designed to carry up to eight pounds and travel to customers within a 10-mile radius. Its larger Platform 1 drones are used for long-range deliveries for enterprise, business, and government that can cover 120 miles round trip. The P2 platform started in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex with Walmart, and more than a dozen restaurant brands, according to Zipline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has also announced plans to launch in Seattle. Other commercial partners include Panera, Chipotle, Crumbl, Blaze Pizza, Wendy’s, and Little Caesars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That geographic expansion in the United States has fueled Zipline’s delivery numbers. In 2024, the company completed 1 million drone deliveries to customers; this week, Zipline said it had surpassed 2 million deliveries. The company also said its U.S. deliveries have grown by about 15% week-over-week for the last seven months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-founder and CEO Keller Cliffton views 2026 as the company’s breakout year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Autonomous logistics has been maturing for more than a decade, and the last year has made it unmistakably clear that when deliveries are faster, cleaner, safer, and cheaper, demand isn’t just high, it grows exponentially,” Cliffton said in a statement. “In 2026 autonomous logistics will become an everyday staple for people across several states in the U.S. That transformation starts with Houston and my home town of Phoenix, which we’ll begin serving early this year, and then expand to even more places across the country throughout the year.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zipline isn’t alone in the nascent industry of drone delivery. Other competitors include Flytrex, DroneUp, Amazon Prime Air, and Wing, the Alphabet-owned subsidiary that has also partnered with Walmart. Wing announced plans to expand to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/wing-to-expand-drone-delivery-to-another-150-walmart-stores/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">another 150 Walmart stores</a> through 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It has now raised a total of $700 million, the company says, from backers including Sequoia, Nvidia, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Bond, Craft Ventures, Mayo Clinic, and others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenEvidence is an AI-powered medical information platform, similar to what WebMD was for the previous internet generation, but it’s geared toward doctors. This puts it somewhat more in competition with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/\">Anthropic’s Claude for Healthcare</a>, which is intended for patients, payers, and providers, whereas <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/openai-unveils-chatgpt-health-says-230-million-users-ask-about-health-each-week/\">ChatGPT’s new health product</a> is aimed more at consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says that the free, ad-supported platform served 18 million clinical consultations from verified healthcare professionals in the U.S. in December alone. That compares to about 3 million searches per month a year ago. It also said that it had surpassed $100 million in revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The expansion, which starts next week, will be gradual, the company says, noting it may take months for the full rollout to complete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly praised the social app and X rival, which has now grown to over 400 million monthly active users, as the company’s next big hit. Shortly after the app’s debut, the exec told investors that Threads had a good chance of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/26/zuckerberg-says-threads-has-a-good-chance-of-reaching-1-billion-users-in-a-few-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reaching 1 billion users</a> in a few years’ time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app has rapidly grown since its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/threads-passes-2-million-downloads-in-2-hours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">July 2023 debut</a>, reaching <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/02/metas-threads-cross-200-million-active-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">200 million users</a> by mid-2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/threads-adds-another-20m-users-since-december-reaching-320m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">320 million as of January 2025</a>, and then adding <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/threads-tops-350m-monthly-users-after-adding-30m-in-the-quarter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">another 30 million</a> as of last April, before reaching its latest milestone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Threads hasn’t yet hit that milestone, the company has been testing ads for some time. A year ago, Threads began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/threads-is-testing-ads-in-the-u-s-and-japan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">testing ads in the U.S. and Japan</a>, and last April, the platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/metas-threads-opens-up-ads-to-global-advertisers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened up to global advertisers</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has made it easy for existing advertisers to expand their reach to include Threads by allowing them to automatically place ads through both Meta’s Advantage+ program and via manual campaigns. Supported formats include image and video ads, including the newer additions of the 4:5 aspect ratio format and carousel ads. Advertisers can manage their Threads ads alongside those for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in their Business Settings, which simplifies cross-posting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Meta expanded the third-party verification already available on Facebook and Instagram (including feed and Reels) to the Threads feed through Meta Business Partners. This provides advertisers with independent brand safety and suitability verification for Threads — a useful feature when Threads’ nearest rival is dealing with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">scourge of illegal deepfakes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company didn’t share how often users would see ads in their feed but noted that ad delivery initially would remain “low” as the feature scaled to global users.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Soon, viewers will finally have the chance to watch any content they choose. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​In his <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/the-future-of-youtube-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">annual letter</a> published on Wednesday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan revealed that the platform will soon introduce a “fully customizable multiview” experience. This upgrade aims to provide greater personalization by letting viewers create their own multiview layouts, tailoring their screens to their individual interests across sports, news, entertainment, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​YouTube TV first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/youtube-tv-launches-early-access-to-a-multiview-feature-for-watching-four-streams-at-once/\">rolled out</a> the multiview feature for sports broadcasts in 2023, allowing fans to watch multiple games simultaneously. The feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/youtube-tvs-multiview-feature-now-offers-non-sports-content/\">later expanded</a> to include other categories, such as news and weather, though it was initially restricted to a set list of preselected channels, including CNN, MSNBC, HGTV, and Food Network. Later on, YouTube TV began testing a way for a small group of users to customize which channels they wanted to watch side by side without restriction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new capability is expected to appeal to families and larger households with diverse viewing preferences, as it allows different genres to be watched together on a single screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​To try out multiview, press the down button on your remote, then look for the Multiview icon or the “Watch Multiview” option, and select it. From there, you can pick up to three more live channels to add to your screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Additionally, Mohan highlighted YouTube TV’s upcoming launch of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/youtube-tv-to-launch-genre-based-subscription-plans-in-2026/\">genre-specific channel packages</a>, designed to give subscribers more flexibility over what content they pay for. For example, viewers can choose specialized packages focused on sports, news, family programming, or entertainment, tailoring their subscriptions to their interests and potentially saving on costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, YouTube TV hasn’t shared much about these packages, like how much they’ll cost or when they’ll launch. We can likely expect more information to be announced in the coming months as the platform prepares for rollout.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users have posted more than 5.2 million responses, creating enough buzz to spill over onto other platforms. On Spotify, user-generated “2016” playlists have increased <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTlZI36EY2I/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=MXkwNmRqMnA2cW1ycQ==\">790%</a> since the new year, and the company now boasts in its Instagram bio that it’s “romanticizing 2016 again.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fairness, 2016 does seem like a simpler time. Donald Trump had not yet served a day in the White House, no one knew the difference between an N95 and a KN95 mask, and Twitter was still called Twitter. It was the year of “Pokémon Go Summer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as often happens, the nostalgia skims over a lot of the anxiety that was already palpable at the time. When meme librarian Amanda Brennan searched her archives for the images that defined 2016, she showed me a screenshot that surprised me, given the internet’s current obsession with the year. The post reads, “Can’t believe that the devil put all of his energy into 2016,” with another user adding, “It’s like he had an assignment due January 1, 2017 and forgot until now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I forgot how much everyone hated 2016 at the time. It was the year of Brexit, the culmination of the Syrian civil war, the Zika virus, and the Pulse nightclub shooting, to name just a few sources of dread. It wasn’t just the polarizing election of Donald Trump — months before that night, a Slate columnist <a href=\"https://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2016/07/is_2016_the_worst_year_in_history.html#:~:text=When%20news%20of%20the,year%20while%20it's%20still%20unfolding?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sincerely posed the question</a> of how bad 2016 was when compared with notoriously awful years like 1348, when the Black Death took hold, or 1943, the height of the Holocaust.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084266\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png 1078w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=300,239 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=768,611 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=680,541 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=430,342 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=720,573 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=900,716 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=800,637 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=668,532 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=471,375 471w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=775,617 775w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=667,531 667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tumblr</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The start of a new year is fertile grounds for nostalgia. The internet thrives on this kind of engagement bait, to the point that Facebook, Snapchat, and even the built-in Apple Photos app constantly remind us what we were doing a year ago. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This time around, though, our nostalgia feels different, and it’s not just political. As AI increasingly encroaches on everything we do on the internet, 2016 also represents a moment before The Algorithm™ took over, when “<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">enshittification</a>” had not yet reached the point of no return.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To better understand the state of the internet in 2016, Brennan suggests viewing it as the 10-year anniversary of 2006, when the social internet definitively cemented itself in our lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In 2006, technology changed. Twitter was launched, Google bought YouTube, Facebook started allowing anyone above 13 to register,” Brennan told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before social platforms, the internet was a place for people who looked online for a sense of community — people who were “for lack of a better term, nerdy,” as Brennan puts it. But when social media took off, <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/internet-is-leaking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the internet began leaking</a>, and the barrier between pop culture and internet culture began to erode.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By 2016, you will see that ten years of time has let people evolve, and people who necessarily were not internet nerds to begin with maybe ended up on 4chan, and all of these smaller little places where previously, they had been made of internet people, versus people who are not as online,” she said. “But also, because of phones, everyone is kind of an internet person now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Brennan’s estimation, it makes sense that 2016 was the year that Pepe the Frog — once an amiable stoner from a webcomic — was corrupted into a hate symbol and the misogyny that fueled Gamergate showed up on the national political stage. (Meanwhile, left-leaning meme groups <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/16209-dat-boi-might-be-racist-and-it-s-ruining-a-facebook-group-for-dank-memes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sparred internally</a> about whether the “dat boi” meme — an image of a frog riding a unicycle — had appropriated African American Vernacular English.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, it felt novel to point out how internet culture had begun informing our political reality. Within another decade, we had a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/the-people-in-elon-musk-doge-universe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pseudo-government agency named after a meme</a>, which — to name just one of its many atrocities — cut international aid funding and led to <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/usaid-shutdown-has-led-to-hundreds-of-thousands-of-deaths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the death of hundreds of thousands of people</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another 10 years later, we’ve now had a full two decades to reckon with how the social internet has shaped us. But for people who were children in 2016, the year still holds a certain mystique. Google worked well. It was relatively easy to spot deepfakes. Teachers didn’t have to funnel all of their limited resources into determining if a student copy-pasted their homework from ChatGPT. Dating apps still held promise. There weren’t that many videos on Instagram. “Hamilton” was cool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a rosy view of an online era that had its own mess of problems, yet it aligns with a larger movement toward a more analog lifestyle — it’s the same phenomenon that precipitated the resurgence of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/well/dating-irl-analog-online.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in-person matchmaking events</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/26/digital-camera-gen-z-vintage-photos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">point-and-shoot digital cameras</a>. Social media has become so central to our lives that it’s not fun anymore, and people want to go back to a time before anyone had ever uttered the word “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling#:~:text=The%20term%20was%20first%20used,relation%20to%20the%20climate%20crisis.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">doomscrolling</a>.” Who could blame them?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

She’s joining <a href=\"https://www.acrewcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Acrew Capital</a> as a general partner, working alongside founding partner Lauren Kolodny and the firm’s other partners, Rosenthal and Kolodny tell TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rosenthal left OpenAI about eight months ago after a three-year sprint at the AI lab that saw the launch of DALL·E, ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, Sora, and other products. “I wasn’t initially looking to join a VC fund,” she told TechCrunch. “I was out there meeting with lots of AI startups.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But after growing OpenAI’s enterprise sales team from two people to hundreds, she saw the appeal when Kolodny pitched her on venture capital. Instead of helping one startup with its go-to-market strategy, she could help a portfolio of them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In her time at OpenAI, “I learned a lot about behavior, both on the side of the buyers, how people are thinking about these purchases, and the gap between what most organizations think is possible and what they can actually deploy today,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, she has firsthand insight into what kind of moat an AI startup can build that won’t leave it vulnerable when model makers like OpenAI launch competing products.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Will OpenAI “just build everything and put every company out of business? You know, they are doing a lot already: they’re in consumer, they’re in enterprise, they’re building a device. I don’t think they are going to go after every potential enterprise application,” she says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So one moat is for enterprise AI startups to offer specialization. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-context-as-moat\">Context as moat</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, she thinks the key to a good startup moat will be “context” — or the information the AI stores in its context window memory as it works on requests.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Context is dynamic.

And I think what we’re seeing is going beyond sort of the basic RAG towards this idea of a context graph, which is persistent,” she says referring to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/04/why-rag-wont-solve-generative-ais-hallucination-problem/\">Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) the de facto method as of 2025 to minimize hallucinations by training LLMs on trusted, specific sources (and having the LLM cite them). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s still a lot of tech that needs to be developed for this area, though, from memory to reasoning beyond pattern recognition. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I expect real innovation here. I think this year we will see new approaches — the idea of context and memory,” Rosenthal says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But beyond startups working directly on context engineering, Rosenthal thinks enterprise apps that bake it in will have the advantage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ultimately, when we talk about moat, I think who owns and manages this context layer will become a large advantage for AI products,” she says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another opportunity she sees: startups not building atop a major lab’s state-of-the-art models, with their high prices.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there is room in the market for cheaper models that are lighter weight and innovate on inference costs,” she says. These are models that are not, perhaps, at the top of the leaderboards of various benchmarks but “are still very useful” and more affordable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where I’m really excited to invest is on the application layer. I’m really interested in what will be the durable applications built on all of these different models, not just on the foundational models,” she says. She’s seeking startups with “interesting use cases” or that use AI to help enterprise employees work more efficiently.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for where she’s going to find these startups, she’ll be working her network among OpenAI’s alums for starters. Now that the AI outfit is 10 years old, the alums network has grown. Many have already founded startups that have raised big bucks at high valuations, ranging from OpenAI’s biggest competitor, Anthropic, to buzzy early-stage companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/ilya-sutskever-will-lead-safe-superintelligence-following-his-ceos-exit/\">Safe Superintelligence</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is also a growing precedent for high-level ex-OpenAI folks to become seed-stage investors. About a year ago, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s former head of consumer products, joined Felicis. He’s been crushing it ever since, and clearly having fun, getting in on big deals for hot startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/lmarena-lands-1-7b-valuation-four-months-after-launching-its-product/\">LMArena</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/top-openai-google-brain-researchers-set-off-a-300m-vc-frenzy-for-their-startup-periodic-labs/\">Periodic Labs</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I actually had a call with Peter a few months ago, and he helped me make the decision,” Rosenthal said of her choice to become an investor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Rosenthal may have a secret weapon to win deals. She also has deep contacts among AI enterprise users — the type of buyers and beta testers these early AI startups need. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprises still don’t understand how much AI can do for them. “There’s a really large gap that I am very optimistic can be filled. It leaves a huge green field for applications and companies.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube Shorts viewers might soon see AI versions of their favorite creators when scrolling through their feeds. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16440338?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Wednesday that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using their own likeness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This year you’ll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,” Mohan wrote in his annual letter. “Throughout this evolution, AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shorts, which Mohan said now averages 200 billion daily views, is one of YouTube’s most popular mediums. The company continues to invest in Shorts to sustain its viewership. While YouTube didn’t share additional details about these likenesses, the new capability will join the platform’s current AI tools for Shorts, including the ability to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/youtube-announces-new-generative-ai-tools-for-shorts-creators/\">generate AI clips</a>, AI stickers, AI auto-dubbing, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube will also equip creators with new tools to manage the use of their likeness in AI-generated content, according to Mohan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While YouTube will allow creators to feature their own likeness in their videos, the Google-owned platform recently launched technology to prevent others from using it. Last October, YouTube <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/youtubes-likeness-detection-technology-has-officially-launched/\">rolled out likeness-detection technology</a> to eligible creators to identify AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. Creators can then request the removal of AI-generated content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with other social platforms, YouTube has dealt with the spread of AI slop. Mohan says the company is working to maintain a high-quality viewing experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem,” Mohan <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/the-future-of-youtube-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>. “Today, once-odd trends like ASMR and watching other people play video games are mainstream hits. But with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube is also set to expand Shorts with new formats, including image posts, which are already popular on TikTok and Instagram Reels.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The report also said in the first year of sales, OpenAI aims to ship 40 to 50 million units.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s ChatGPT has nearly a billion weekly users, but the company has to rely on other devices and platforms for distribution. With its own device, it might want to take more control of the development and distribution of the AI assistant and also release exclusive and purpose-built features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, replacing existing earbuds like AirPods in users’ daily lives is going to be challenging if there’s not a strong integration with operating systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until now, there hasn’t been a standout AI device success story. Last year, the Humane AI Pin got sold to HP. Rabbit is still just chugging along after the initial hype of 2024. And the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/friend-delays-shipments-of-its-ai-companion-pendant/\">Friend AI companion necklace</a> received a swift backlash for its marketing tactics.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, big tech companies are making moves into wearables.

I would play my word. She would play hers. We would play back and forth over a few days, and the entire time, neither of us would have to see any overwhelming technicolor ads with deceptive skip buttons that blast us with even more pop-ups. It’s a simple life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You would think such an app already existed. You would be wrong. Until now. (Zynga, I will never forgive you for what you’ve done to Words With Friends).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At last, The New York Times Games has brought my humble dreams to life with a Scrabble-like multiplayer app called <a href=\"https://www.nytco.com/games/#:~:text=The%20Latest%20From%20Games,York%20Times%20Games%20Introduces%20Crossplay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Crossplay</a>, available now on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/nyt-crossplay-play-and-spell/id6615086509\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.wordgame&amp;hl=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Android</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crossplay is not a Scrabble clone exactly, but unless you are the type of Scrabble lover that goes to tournaments or memorizes the Scrabble dictionary, it’s basically Scrabble. The game board and tile distribution are a bit different, and there’s a slight rule change around what happens once the bag runs out of tiles. Those differences may have been done for legal reasons. As a casual player, I barely noticed them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other social word games, Crossplay allows you to invite friends to play, or you can get matched with strangers near your skill level. For New York Times Games subscribers, the game will have no ads at all, but free users might see some banner ads. Still, it beats paying <em>$10 a month</em> to remove ads from Words With Friends, yet still have to deal with a cartoon-like interface, among other features that annoy me.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083192\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=768,393 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=680,348 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1200,613 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1280,654 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=430,220 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=720,368 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=900,460 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=800,409 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1536,785 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=2048,1047 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=668,341 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1207,617 1207w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=708,362 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Behold: one game that looks normal, and one that looks like Cocomelon for adults</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Crossplay (left), Words With Friends (right)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Scrabble purists may quibble about the slight rule changes, they may find delight in a feature of the game called CrossBot.

It ranks your gameplay in terms of both luck and strategy, then highlights both your best moves, and those where you faltered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York Times has been publishing its Crossword puzzle since 1942, but its digital gaming business kicked into high gear in 2022 when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/\">bought Wordle</a> after it went viral. According to data from <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351069/000119312524062156/d809296dpx14a6g.htm?utm_campaign=hollywood-s-cheap-ai-fix-won-t-work&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ValueAct Capital</a>, a hedge fund that invests in the Times, users spent <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more time in the Games app</a> than the actual News app by the end of 2023.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m not the only one who was craving a multi-player word game without egregious distractions — Jonathan Knight, head of Games at The New York Times, thinks this is what makes its Games vertical so successful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Games like Spelling Bee and Wordle found a way to take the magical ‘solve a puzzle’ feeling and create a very mainstream, quick, snackable version of that that works well on your phone, that’s very sharable with friends and family, and that I think is very respectful of your time,” Knight told TechCrunch. “You can just decide to do it in the morning, or at night before you go to bed, and then go to bed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to The New York Times, Wordle was played 4.2 billion times in 2025. Connections was played 1.6 billion times.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch spoke to Wordle creator Josh Wardle shortly before he sold his game, he shared a mindset similar to Knight’s. He told us, “people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sure, a publicly traded company like The New York Times isn’t as pure of heart as an indie developer making a game for his partner, but the spirit of the game has persisted. Even as Wordle’s viral moment passed, people kept up with their daily habit, according to Knight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The share rate on Wordle — the percentage of users that share every day — has not changed since we acquired the game,” he said. “It’s a really cool way to bring people together. You know, we see the Pope talking about his Wordle, sharing with his brother.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Knight’s team wants to extend the quiet simplicity of its games philosophy to Crossplay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We wanted people to be able to just get in and play the game with friends and family, and then get on with your day,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s where Cam Badger got his start, at a pharmaceutical company. He expected to find structure and mentorship on the job but instead found “fragmented training, inconsistent coaching, and no real way to scale learning in a meaningful way,” he told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He spent four years as a sales rep, then a sales trainer, and then worked for a medical startup where he met Dr. Benny Alouf. The two lamented about how awful many sales reps were at life science companies like pharma businesses, medical device startups, and so forth. The duo, alongside Bhrugu Giri, decided to try and fix this, launching <a href=\"https://www.praxispro.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PraxisPro</a>, a sales coaching platform specifically targeted at medical fields.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He believes that better salespeople will help get more treatments into doctors’ hands, which will ultimately help their patients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When commercial interactions with healthcare providers are ineffective, patients don’t get a fair shot at therapies that could meaningfully change their lives,” Badger, the company’s CEO, said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PraxisPro launched in 2023, though its first product was not released until 2025. The company announced on Wednesday a $6 million seed round led by AlleyCorp. Others in the round include Flybridge, South Loop Ventures, and Zeal Capital Partners. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PraxisPro is a standalone platform that can also be integrated into enterprise software. It develops small language models trained on life science data to help each company navigate the nuances and context needed to interact with healthcare providers. From there, the company has created an AI agent that helps the commercial sales team practice their communication skills before engaging with customers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Badger said communication is critical in medical sales. So many teams are worried about staying compliant, as each company is responsible for ensuring sales messaging complies with legal frameworks. Aside from helping train sales reps to stay compliant, PraxisPro also hopes to help better educate them to communicate patient needs with healthcare providers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, a salesperson may have 15 interactions with a healthcare provider as part of the sales process. PraxisPro has a conversational AI feature that lets sales reps practice and plan these interactions and be better prepared for what the discussion usually entails, including any pushback that might come up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are other AI role-playing tools (like Quantified and SmartWinnr), but Badger says his is different because his company is trained on smaller datasets and specifically focuses on the life sciences sector. The fresh capital will be used toward research and development, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, this was the tool he wished he had when he was still working as a sales rep all those years ago. He struggled, he said, and almost lost his job, but managed to work his way up to become one of the company’s top performers. Now, he wants to give others a hand. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If we can give commercial teams the ability to prepare, practice, and engage at a higher level, consistently and responsibly, then we’re not just improving commercial operations, but we’re helping ensure that innovative therapies reach the patients who need them most,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to clarify the name of the co-founder. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Lemonade said it would train its own usage-based risk prediction models to determine when a driver is using Full Self-Driving or operating the vehicle themselves, and price accordingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lemonade is calling the new product “Autonomous Car insurance.” Tesla’s software does not currently make cars completely autonomous, and drivers need to be ready to take over at any moment. But the product is clearly a bet that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will ultimately fulfill his long-delayed promise that his company will make that happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Traditional insurers treat a Tesla like any other car, and AI like any other driver. But a driver who can see 360 degrees, never gets drowsy, and reacts in milliseconds isn’t like any other driver,” Shai Wininger, co-founder and president of Lemonade, said in a statement. “Our existing pay-per-mile product has given us something no traditional insurer has: a unique tech stack designed to collect massive amounts of real driving data for precise, dynamic pricing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new car insurance product will launch in Arizona on January 26, and in Oregon the following month. Lemonade claims that “the safer FSD software becomes, the more our prices will drop.” The company’s existing auto insurance offering is available for “most popular cars” in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has offered its own car insurance to customers for years now, though in late 2025 the company was hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI). The automaker was accused, along with partner State National Insurance Company, of “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims,” “unreasonable denials,” and engaging in “unfair claims settlement practices.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has denied the allegations.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/03/advanced-geothermal-startups-are-just-getting-warmed-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">like Fervo and Sage Geosystems</a> have been pursuing that angle, and experts agree it has tremendous potential. By contrast, conventional geothermal, which taps naturally fractured hot spots, has been stagnant, generating just <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/2025-us-geothermal-market-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">4 gigawatts</a> in the United States, up only <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=17871\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about a gigawatt</a> in the last decade or so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conventional geothermal has been held back by outdated assumptions, Hoiland told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They underestimated how many undiscovered systems there are, maybe by an order of magnitude or more,” Hoiland said. With modern drilling techniques, “you can get a lot more out of each of them, maybe even an order of magnitude or more from each of those. All of a sudden the number goes from tens of gigawatts to what could be a terawatt-scale opportunity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zanskar is relying on AI to help break conventional geothermal out of its malaise. In the process, the startup has resuscitated a flagging power plant in New Mexico and discovered two new sites with over 100 megawatts of combined potential.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those successes have helped Zanskar land a $115 million Series C led by Spring Lane Capital with participation from the All Aboard Fund, Carica Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Imperative Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Munich Re Ventures, Obvious Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, StepStone Group, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Tranquillion, Union Square Ventures, University Growth Fund, and UP.Partners.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many potential geothermal sites have been overlooked because people have been searching for evidence on the surface like a hot spring or a volcano, Hoiland said. But about 95% of all geothermal systems lack such a tell, he added. “We just keep finding them by accident. That is a great application for AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To find new geothermal resources, Zanskar first feeds supervised machine learning models a range of data, including past accidental discoveries. When they have identified a promising site, the company sends a team to the site to validate the discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zanskar then has to come up with a plan to develop it. For that, the team uses another AI approach, one developed for this very purpose called “Bayesian evidential learning” (BEL). In BEL, existing data helps build a series of assumptions known as “priors,” and then models work to falsify those hypotheses, spitting out probabilities for each. Where there are gaps, the startup has built a geothermal simulator to fill in the blanks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Zanskar’s approach has been working. The previous funding round allowed the startup to explore three sites, each of which it considered a success. “Three of three,” said Zanskar co-founder and CTO Joel Edwards. “What does it look like when you try 10?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has enough sites in the pipeline to support at least a gigawatt of generating capacity, Hoiland said. For now, they’ve been focused on the U.S. West, which has the most potential. He would like to find at least 10 confirmed sites to help Zanskar court project finance investors, which provide access to lower-cost capital than VCs. If the company can make that work, then it might get through the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/27/climate-startup-valley-of-death/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">valley of death</a> that has claimed many other climate tech startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hoiland is not convinced that Zanskar has solved all the challenges associated with finding geothermal resources, but he’s optimistic the company is on the right path.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We now know this is the future of exploration,” he said. “This is going to change geothermal in very short order.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Not coincidentally, it has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/preply-the-language-app-known-for-its-live-tutors-closes-out-series-c-at-120m-and-doubles-down-on-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ramped up AI integration</a> to support its 100,000 tutors and continue scaling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a fine line — Duolingo <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/duolingo-launches-148-courses-created-with-ai-after-sharing-plans-to-replace-contractors-with-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">faced backlash</a> after declaring it would become <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/17/duolingo-ceo-says-controversial-ai-memo-was-misunderstood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an “AI-first company,”</a> and tutors have been a key differentiator for Preply. The company is adamant it won’t replace them — but AI can also bring consistency to a model that relies on self-employed instructors. The future of learning “is going to be human-guided and amplified by AI,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Bigai, Preply already applies AI to features such as lesson summaries and homework, and to match learners to tutors who best fit their needs. To further develop these capabilities, he said Preply is now hiring AI talent across its four offices — Barcelona, London, New York, and Kyiv, the latter of which the company hasn’t left despite the Russian invasion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Preply is headquartered in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.lift99.co/blog/founder-stories-kirill-bigai-preply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">where it got its start</a>, Bigai and his co-founders are Ukrainian and the company has been very actively <a href=\"https://preply.com/en/stand-with-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">supporting their home country</a>. They have been doing that in several ways since the war started, including as an employer. “We are very committed [to the] Ukrainian office,” said Bigai.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Out of Preply’s 750 employees, approximately 150 people work from Kyiv, despite Russian strikes regularly forcing them into shelters and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/17/europe/russia-bombing-ukrainians-freezing-defiant-intl-cmd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">causing power outages</a> that have made the current freezing winter particularly challenging. “Our office has different generators so we have electricity, internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Bigai said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These employees may be grateful to Preply — but Bigai is grateful to them and has deep admiration for his people. “Ukrainians are going through very challenging times, and it builds a significant resilience and creativity,” he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Having to adapt to the reality and uncertainty of war also transformed Preply. “I think the fact that the company went through this experience — and how so many people helped other people — made us stronger, more resilient, more creative,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its new funding, the edtech company has now joined the growing cohort of unicorns with Ukrainian roots, including <a href=\"https://siliconcanals.com/ukraines-fintech-it-group-becomes-unicorn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fintech-IT Group</a> and <a href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/05/29/ukrainian-unicorn-grammarly-raises-1-billion-from-general-captial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Grammarly</a>. But it may also follow in the footsteps of Airbnb, whose former CFO, Laurence Tosi, led the Series D through his growth equity firm, WestCap. While Bigai said Preply has no timeline or concrete IPO plans yet, he noted WestCap’s “phenomenal experience in [taking] companies public, which is one of the things that we will continue to think about.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, this rise could be due to people downloading more apps related to quick commerce, government services, and finance rather than entertainment and other digital products, as the share of revenue from in-app purchases for domestic publishers remained flat.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
