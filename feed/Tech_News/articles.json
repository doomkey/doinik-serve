The problems cited include more than a dozen drone boats that failed during a Navy exercise off California in May, with sailors warning of safety violations and potential loss of life; a mechanical issue that damaged the engine of Anduril’s unmanned jet fighter Fury during a summer ground test; and an August test of its Anvil counterdrone system that caused a 22-acre fire in Oregon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anduril-raises-2-5b-at-30-5b-valuation-led-by-founders-fund/\">$2.5 billion</a> back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine’s SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven’t fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don’t indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/05/michael-burry-1-billion-short-ai-stocks-markets/\">$1 billion that they’d crash</a>. (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/APFj5ZFg42U\">batshit crazy</a>,” to which Burry responded by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/michaeljburry/status/1987685417890799877\">mocking Karp</a> for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.) As for all that customer demand, Burry has basically proposed it’s a mirage because AI customers are “funded by their dealers” in a circular financing scheme.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071133\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png 1786w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=1200,797 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=1280,850 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=430,286 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=720,478 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=900,598 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=800,531 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=1536,1020 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=668,444 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=565,375 565w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=929,617 929w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=708,470 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.00-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enough people have begun citing Burry that Nvidia, despite all its muscle and might and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/nvidias-record-57b-revenue-and-upbeat-forecast-quiets-ai-bubble-talk/\">blowout earnings report</a> last week, felt compelled to respond recently. In a seven-page memo sent to Wall Street analysts last weekend by Nvidia’s investor relations team – a development <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-ai-accounting-allegations-366f16ac\">first reported</a> by Barron’s – the company fired back, saying that Burry’s math is wrong, including because he “incorrectly included RSU taxes” (the real buyback figure is $91 billion, not $112.5 billion, the memo says). Nvidia’s employee compensation is also “consistent with peers.” And Nvidia is definitely, absolutely, not Enron, thank you very much.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Burry’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/michaeljburry/status/1993060087045448009?s=20\">response</a>, in a nutshell: I didn’t compare Nvidia to Enron. I’m comparing Nvidia to Cisco circa the late 1990s, when it overbuilt infrastructure that nobody actually needed at the time and its stock cratered 75% when everyone realized as much.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This could all look like a tempest in a teapot by Thanksgiving next year. Or not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia’s stock has gone up twelvefold since early 2023. The company’s market cap at this moment is $4.5 trillion. Its ascent to becoming the world’s most valuable company is faster than anything the market has seen previously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Burry has a track record that’s complicated. He called the housing crisis, which brought him great acclaim. But since 2008, he has been predicting various apocalypses pretty much constantly, earning him the label “permabear” from critics, while people who listen to him with a kind of cult-like devotion have missed some of the greatest bull runs in market history. Burry smartly bought GameStop early, for example, but he then sold his shares before the meme stock explosion. He shorted Tesla and lost a fortune. After his smart housing crisis call, frustrated investors actually fled his fund because of extended underperformance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Burry deregistered his investment firm, Scion Asset Management, with the SEC. He said it was because of “regulatory and compliance restrictions that effectively muzzled my ability to communicate,” explaining that he was frustrated, watching people misinterpret his tweets on X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last weekend, he launched a Substack called “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://michaeljburry.substack.com/\">Cassandra Unchained</a>” that he’s now using to prosecute his case against the entire AI industrial complex. The descriptor for the newsletter, a yearly subscription to which costs $400, is that it is now Burry’s “sole focus as he gives you a front row seat to his analytical efforts and projections for stocks, markets, and bubbles, often with an eye to history and its remarkably timeless patterns.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071134\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png 1688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=768,542 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=680,480 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=1200,847 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=1280,904 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=430,304 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=720,508 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=900,636 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=800,565 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=1536,1085 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=668,472 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=531,375 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=874,617 874w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=708,500 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-27-at-1.45.22-PM.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People are definitely listening. The newsletter launched less than a week ago, and it already has 90,000 subscribers. Which brings us again to the truly unsettling question hanging over all of this: Is Burry the canary in the coal mine, warning of a collapse that’s inevitable, or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he’s predicting?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">History suggests this isn’t so crazy. Jim Chanos, the famous short seller, didn’t create Enron’s accounting fraud, but his high-profile criticisms in 2000 and 2001 gave other investors permission to question the company and accelerated its unraveling. Prominent hedge fund manager David Einhorn’s detailed takedown of Lehman Brothers’ accounting tricks at a 2008 conference made other investors more skeptical and may have hastened the loss of confidence that led to collapse. In both cases, the underlying problems were real, but a credible critic with a platform created a crisis of confidence that became self-fulfilling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If enough investors believe Burry about AI overbuilding, they will sell. The selling will validate his bearish thesis. More investors will sell. Burry doesn’t need to be right about every detail – he just needs to be persuasive enough to trigger the stampede. Looking at Nvidia’s November performance, it’s easy to conclude Burry’s warnings are taking hold; seeing its shares’ performance over the entire year, it’s less obvious that’s the case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much clearer is that Nvidia has everything to lose, including an almost mind-blowingly massive market cap and its position as the most indispensable company of the AI age. Meanwhile, Burry has nothing to lose but his reputation and a new megaphone that he’ll presumably be using at full volume for the foreseeable future.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2025-is-glid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the winner of this year’s competition</a>, Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://www.glidtech.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Glīd</a>, a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-ff6aa4d2-64d2-42c3-b360-8abc2888f65c\">Damoa first discovered the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/glid-is-building-an-autonomous-shortcut-to-move-freight-from-road-to-rail-catch-it-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army</a>, where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-283f71b0-2c29-4294-9269-d5792e7b4e77\">Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-41f201dd-cdfa-49ab-a090-58f5f0a0449b\">“Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-d98fad0e-0701-49eb-b2e8-fed02bc55ad0\">In this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase. They’re already launching a pilot with Great Plains Industrial Park, and their next product Glīder is about to hit the market. And the team is hiring for roles in nearly every aspect of the business. Their process is more on the casual end of the spectrum, with Damoa calling it “an organic process” where an initial vibe check and résumé review can turn into a new team member.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-d98fad0e-0701-49eb-b2e8-fed02bc55ad0\">Damoa says that process has attracted people who are mission driven, laser-focused, all while practicing mindfulness. That makes sense when the CEO is the kind of leader who responds to the news that they’ve made the top five in Startup Battlefield by saying: “I’m going to meditate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-6ed468cb-2c3e-439b-a4b5-7163c12e7e02\">Using this human-centric approach, the Glīd team has attracted people who are mission driven and laser-focused, all while practicing mindfulness.

This is the final StrictlyVC event of 2025, and truly, the lineup is ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The series has traveled around the globe under the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/08/29/techcrunch-acquires-strictlyvc-connie-loizos\">auspices</a> of TechCrunch. Steve Case rented a theater in D.C.; we talked to Greece’s prime minister in Athens<strong>;</strong> and Kirsten Green hosted us at the Presidio in San Francisco. The concept is always the same, though: bring together people who are working on genuinely important developments in a smaller setting, before everyone else figures out they’re important.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of our favorite moments was when, in 2019, Sam Altman told a StrictlyVC crowd that OpenAI’s monetization strategy was basically “build AGI, then ask it how to make money.” Everyone laughed. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/18/sam-altmans-leap-of-faith/\">He wasn’t joking</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This time we’ve got Nicholas Kelez, a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/what-is-substrate-a-thiel-backed-chip-startup-seeking-to-crack-asml-s-dominance?embedded-checkout=true\">chasing after the same prize</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s Mina Fahmi, who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">turns them into text</a>. Before you roll your eyes, know that he and cofounder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired. The Stream Ring isn’t trying to be your friend — it’s trying to extend your brain. Backed by Toni Schneider, an operator who scaled WordPress in its earlier days, Sandbar just emerged from stealth and might well be onto something. (Schneider is a partner at True Ventures, whose other hardware bets have included Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit; he’s also coming to Palo Alto next week.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We have Max Hodak — Science Corp founder, Time magazine <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/\">cover subject</a>, and, earlier, Neuralink cofounder — who has already restored vision to dozens of blind people with retinal implants. Now he’s working on “biohybrid” brain-computer interfaces where chips seeded with stem cells grow into your brain tissue so paralyzed people can control devices with their thoughts. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, as Hodak views it. In fact, he thinks 2035 is going to look wildly different from today, and he’s happy to share how.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, we’re thrilled to welcome Chi-Hua Chien and Elizabeth Weil, two VCs who’ve backed Twitter, Spotify, TikTok, Slack, SpaceX, Figma, and Coinbase before they were household names. Chien runs Goodwater Capital; Weil founded Scribble Ventures after stints at Andreessen Horowitz and Twitter, made 100+ angel investments, and has a first fund showing 4x returns. (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/in-a-crowded-vc-landscape-elizabeth-weils-scribble-ventures-shows-that-networks-still-matter/\">Her network</a> is so good that it’s annoying.) Both think Silicon Valley is completely misreading the moment while everyone pours capital into enterprise AI, and they’ll explain why. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PlayGround Global is hosting, along with general partner Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of Intel.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/07/techcrunch-disrupt-2025s-startup-battlefield-200-celebrating-outstanding-achievements/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">won best pitch</a> in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms.

On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/mental-health-litigation-approach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">responded</a> to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Edelson said OpenAI’s response has not adequately addressed the family’s concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam’s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,” Edelson said in his statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the Raines sued OpenAI and Altman, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">seven more lawsuits</a> have been filed that seek to hold the company accountable for three additional suicides and four users experiencing what the lawsuits describe as AI-induced psychotic episodes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of these cases echo Raine’s story. Zane Shamblin, 23, and Joshua Enneking, 26, also had hours-long conversations with ChatGPT directly before their respective suicides. As in Raine’s case, the chatbot failed to discourage them from their plans. According to the lawsuit, Shamblin considered postponing his suicide so that he could attend his brother’s graduation. But ChatGPT told him, “bro … missing his graduation ain’t failure. it’s just timing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At one point during the conversation leading up to Shamblin’s suicide, the chatbot told him that it was letting a human take over the conversation, but this was false, as ChatGPT did not have the functionality to do so. When Shamblin asked if ChatGPT could really connect him with a human, the chatbot replied, “nah man — i can’t do that myself. that message pops up automatically when stuff gets real heavy … if you’re down to keep talking, you’ve got me.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Raine family’s case is expected to go to a jury trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the </em><a href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</em></a><em>.

Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies\">OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-u-s-government-agencies/\">designed to provide U.S. government agencies</a> an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults\">More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-techs-faults/\">according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.</a> In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days\">OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously/\">the company’s AI “agent” tool,</a> for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days/\">which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.</a></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously\">OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously/\">take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.</a> Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operator, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/openais-agent-tool-may-be-nearing-release/\">OpenAI’s agent tool,</a> could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openais-agent-tool-will-be-available-to-users-paying-200-per-month-for-pro/\">Operator will be available as an early research preview</a> to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/arrakis_ai/status/1882343287522226591\">a user on X who goes by Choi</a> spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups\">OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/openai-tests-letting-users-sign-up-for-chatgpt-with-only-a-phone-number/\">sign up with only a phone number</a> — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks\">ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks/\">allows users to set simple reminders</a>. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z\">New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/chatgpts-newest-feature-lets-user-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z/\">customize their interactions with ChatGPT.</a> Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Makuh90/status/1877479064967295484\">some users reported</a> that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-faqs\">FAQs:</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is ChatGPT? How does it work?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai/\">OpenAI</a>. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When did ChatGPT get released?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the latest version of ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/openais-newest-model-is-gpt-4o/\">GPT-4o</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I use ChatGPT for free?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a free version of <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/auth/login?next=/chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT</a> that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT Plus</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who uses ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/microsofts-new-bing-was-using-gpt-4-all-along/\">search engines</a> are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What companies use ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/apple-reportedly-limits-internal-use-of-ai-powered-tools-like-chatgpt-and-github-copilot/\">limit the use of the AI-powered tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/windows-11-gets-an-ai-copilot/\">Microsoft announced</a> at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/looking-glass-taps-chatgpt-for-holograms-you-can-talk-to/\">Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT</a> to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/solana-chatgpt-blockchain/\">Solana officially integrated the chatbot</a> into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT write essays?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT commit libel?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/the-great-pretender/\">Due to the nature of how these models work</a>, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We will see how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT</a> will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an app?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/chatgpts-mobile-app-revenue-saw-biggest-spike-yet-following-gpt-4o-launch/\">there is a free ChatGPT mobile app</a> for iOS and Android users.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the ChatGPT character limit?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an API?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/openai-launches-an-api-for-chatgpt-plus-dedicated-capacity-for-enterprise-customers/\">released</a> March 1, 2023.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How good is ChatGPT at writing code?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you save a ChatGPT chat?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. There are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/17/developers-are-looking-for-creative-ways-to-build-ai-powered-chatbot-assistants/\">multiple AI-powered chatbot</a> competitors such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.together.xyz/\">Together</a>, Google’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/what-is-google-gemini-ai/\">Gemini</a> and Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/anthropic-launches-claude-a-chatbot-to-rival-openais-chatgpt/\">Claude</a>, and developers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/theres-now-an-open-source-alternative-to-chatgpt-but-good-luck-running-it/\">creating open source</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meet-the-team-developing-an-open-source-chatgpt-alternative/\">alternatives</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out <a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this form</a>. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “<a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request</a>”.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">here</a> for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/jailbreak-tricks-discords-new-chatbot-into-sharing-napalm-and-meth-instructions/\">two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine</a> (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Australian mayor has publicly announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/06/australian-mayor-prepares-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">he may sue OpenAI for defamation</a> due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Futurism reported</a> the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">accused</a> of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several major school systems and colleges, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/as-nyc-public-schools-block-chatgpt-openai-says-its-working-on-mitigations-to-help-spot-chatgpt-generated-text/\">including New York City Public Schools</a>, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">not every educator agrees with</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have also been cases of ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">accusing individuals of false crimes</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is <a href=\"https://promptbase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PromptBase</a>. Another is <a href=\"https://chatx.ai/marketplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatX</a>. More launch every day.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT be detected?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/openai-releases-tool-to-detect-ai-generated-text-including-from-chatgpt/\">tests</a>, they’re inconsistent at best.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are ChatGPT chats public?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. But OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649806/chatgpt-chat-histories-bug-exposed-disabled-outage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">recently</a> disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/28/23575919/microsoft-openai-github-dismiss-copilot-ai-copyright-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">involved</a> in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is continually updated with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

CNBC was the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/25/gm-software-leader-baris-cetinok-leaving.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first to report</a> the departure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, who was hired in March as head of AI at the automaker, have also left in the past month. Cetinok and Richardson joined GM in 2023. All three had deep tech experience, with stints at a variety of tech companies including Apple and Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The departures come several months after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/gm-taps-aurora-co-founder-for-new-chief-product-officer-role/\">GM hired Sterling Anderson</a> to a newly created chief product officer position. Anderson’s role puts him in direct contact, and management, of nearly every vehicle development-related department at GM.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Anderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry who reports to GM President Mark Reuss, leads the vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. The aim of the position is to oversee the entire lifecycle of GM’s portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The departures are part of a restructuring within GM that’s supposed to remove silos within the business and better integrate how software is developed and deployed in the company’s cars, trucks, and SUVs. Instead of separate teams, each with overlapping roles, the plan is to integrate hardware and software engineering, AI capabilities, and global product into one organization, according to a series of statements covering each executive’s departure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Anderson reshapes the organization, he is also bringing in new talent. Cristian Mori, who has been at Symbiotic, Rivian, and Boston Dynamics over the past five years, has been hired into a new role to head up robotics. While GM has a team of manufacturing engineers that develops automation and robotics, there has never been a specific chief robotics role, which will fall under Anderson’s organization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM hired Behrad Toghi, who previously worked at Apple, in October as AI lead. The company also hired Rashed Haq as its vice president of autonomous vehicles. Haq spent five years at Cruise, the self-driving vehicle company acquired and later shuttered by GM, as its head of AI and robotics.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Green-Lieber is based in Denmark and has been building in the ecosystem for the past 15 years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He chalked up the success of the ecosystem to a few things, including the region’s social safety that lets young people take risks without fear of losing everything.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The newer founders, new generations, are being way more bullish and taking ownership,” he told Equity. “I have not seen, in my 15 years, anything [like] what’s going on right now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s becoming a hub for deep tech and AI, <a href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/how-did-nordics-become-a-hub-for-deep-tech-startups-industry-experts-reveal-the-facts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as one report put it,</a> and is now valued at half a trillion dollars, with Nordic startups receiving a little more than $8 billion in venture investments in 2024. The government also plays a part in these companies, providing funding to startups, like Green-Lieber’s, to help founders grow their companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some ways, Green-Lieber agrees with others that the ecosystem is a few years behind — but, at the same time, “we’re moving tremendously a lot faster,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We couldn’t leave the conversation without talking about AI a little. When asked if we were in a bubble, Green-Lieber said he didn’t know. “There’s tons of opportunities which haven’t been explored,” he said, adding that it’s true that some people are just putting money in bad stuff, but “that’s just the risk of venture capital.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A 136-acre vacant lot owned by the developer that also owns the Colossus property currently borders the site. Given the proposed size, the solar farm would likely produce around 30 megawatts of electricity, only about 10% of the data center’s <a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/xais-colossus-2-first-gigawatt-datacenter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">estimated power use</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s company has come under fire for operating over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/xai-is-facing-a-lawsuit-for-operating-over-400-mw-of-gas-turbines-without-permits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">400 megawatts of natural gas turbines</a> without permits, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). The legal organization, which is working with the NAACP, says that xAI has operated at least 35 turbines capable of emitting more than 2,000 tons of NO<sub>X</sub> pollution — nitrogen oxide emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory problems — annually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The turbines have sparked fierce opposition from residents in nearby Boxtown, a predominantly Black community where researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, found that peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels <a href=\"https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">increased by 79%</a> in areas immediately surrounding the data center after xAI began operations. Community activists have reported increased asthma attacks and respiratory issues since the facility opened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI company has said that it intends to use the turbines until it can secure additional power, but local officials gave xAI a permit to <a href=\"https://www.gem.wiki/Colossus_I_power_station\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">operate 15</a> turbines through January 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, xAI said it would build a <a href=\"https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/money/business/2025/09/17/elon-musk-xai-in-memphis-solar-farm/86186758007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">100-megawatt solar farm</a> nearby, which will be paired with 100 megawatts of grid-scale batteries to provide a 24/7 source of electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hasn’t disclosed the total cost of that project, but the solar farm’s developer, Seven States Power Corporation, was awarded $439 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of that, $414 million is an interest-free loan.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The federal award is notable given that many clean energy grants and loans have been canceled by the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/judges-side-with-trump-epa-over-canceled-inflation-reduction-act-grants-to-nonprofits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Environmental Protection Agency</a> and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/trump-doe-confirms-its-canceling-over-700m-in-manufacturing-grants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Department of Energy</a> under the Trump administration. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, xAI has added gas turbines in Mississippi to power its Colossus 2 data center.

But when someone tells you you’re losing your hair, you buy whatever they suggest.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, he bought the shampoo the hairdresser suggested and left thinking that anyone could sell a man anything by telling him that he’s losing his hair. “Hair loss is such an emotional topic for men and women,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That interaction sent him down a rabbit hole where he discovered how confusing the hair loss industry is, with so much misinformation and clinics with unverified reviews. (He later went to a hair doctor who told him he was, in fact, not balding.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lefort wanted to create a product that, using AI, would help men diagnose hair loss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lefort is a serial entrepreneur, having <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/27/heroes-jobs-series-a-decision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">exited one company</a> and currently running two others with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilenbabnik/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tilen Babnik</a>, who is 28. The duo decided to team up and build a third company: <a href=\"https://www.myhair.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MyHair AI</a>. They vibe coded the product in just a few weeks. It works like this: Users take photos of their heads and upload them to the MyHair app. The AI technology analyzes those photos to measure hair density and detect early signs of hair loss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, as a user uploads more photos, the AI tracks the evolution of their hair loss, letting people build personalized hair loss-protection routines. Users can also find specialists or discover clinics through the platform and read verified reviews so they do not get scammed. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our AI tells you what’s really happening with your hair, matches you with products that actually make sense for your hair type, and explains the science behind them, including possible side effects,” Lefort said. “By bringing transparency and medical accuracy to this $50 billion market, we believe we can completely reorganize how people understand, treat, and shop for hair health.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took around a year of ideation, a few weeks of vibe coding on Cursor, a few months of scientific and clinical validation, and a few more weeks of building a consumer app for the duo to be ready to launch MyHair.AI. The company launched this summer.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We didn’t hire anyone for the initial prototype; it was fully vibe coded,” he said, adding that now that the product has grown, their engineers handle the code to ensure it’s solid and scalable. MyHair AI is one of the many examples of how fast startups can build these days with the rise of vibe-coding prototypes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lefort said the product already has more than 1,000 paying subscribers and 200,000 user accounts. The app has analyzed more than 300,000 scalp photos and has partnerships letting specialists and clinics have access to MyHair AI so they can evaluate their own patients faster. On Wednesday, the company announced that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drtessmauricio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dr. Tess, a renowned dermatologist</a>, is joining the company’s board.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in the market notably include Hims. Lefort said MyHair is different than others because the product is one of the few that’s built a dedicated AI model, trained on more than 300,000 hair images, to diagnose baldness — rather than using a more generic LLM to do so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lefort said the company is now focused on expansion. It wants to build a booking platform and partner with more clinics. He’s hoping to build AI that works in the “real world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Men worry about two things in their health, sexual dysfunction and hair loss,” Lefort said. “We address one of the biggest day-to-day concerns.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

To log into these platforms, a juror is provided a unique numerical identifier assigned to them, which could be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#brute-force\">brute-forced</a> since the number was sequentially incremental. The platform also did not have any mechanism to prevent anyone from flooding the login pages with a large number of guesses, a feature known as “rate-limiting.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early November, the security researcher told TechCrunch that they identified at least one jury management portal for a county in Texas as vulnerable. Inside that portal, TechCrunch saw full names, dates of birth, occupation, email addresses, cell phone numbers, and home and mailing addresses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other exposed data included information shared in the questionnaires that potential jurors are required to fill out to see if they are qualified to serve on a jury.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the portal seen by TechCrunch, the questions asked about the person’s gender, ethnicity, education level, employer, marital status, children, if the person was a citizen, whether they were older than 18, and whether they have been convicted or faced indictment for a theft or felony. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vulnerability could have exposed personal health data inside a juror’s profile in some cases. For example, if a juror had requested to be exempted from service for health reasons, they may have disclosed what medical reason they think disqualifies them. TechCrunch saw an example of that, too.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about vulnerabilities in Tyler Technologies’ products? Or other government tech? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch alerted Tyler of the issue on November 5. Tyler acknowledged the vulnerability on November 25.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement, Tyler spokesperson Karen Shields said that the company’s security team confirmed “a vulnerability exists where some juror information may have been accessible via a brute force attack.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have developed a remediation to prevent unauthorized access and are communicating next steps with our clients,” the statement said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spokesperson did not respond to a series of follow-up questions, including whether Tyler has the technical means to determine if there was any malicious access to jurors’ personal information, and whether it plans to notify people whose data was exposed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not the first time Tyler left sensitive personal data exposed on the internet. In 2023, a security researcher found that, due to a separate security flaw, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/30/us-court-records-systems-vulnerabilities-exposed-sealed-documents/\">some U.S. online court record systems exposed sealed, confidential, and sensitive data</a>, such as witness lists and testimony, mental health evaluations, detailed allegations of abuse, and corporate trade secrets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that case, Tyler fixed vulnerabilities in its Case Management System Plus product, which was used across the state of Georgia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two other government technology providers were exposing data in that case: Catalis, through its CMS360 product, a system used across several U.S. states; and Henschen &amp; Associates, through its CaseLook court record system, used in Ohio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/may-mobility-to-launch-robotaxis-on-uber-platform-this-year-in-texas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> May Mobility</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/uber-and-volkswagen-pair-up-to-launch-robotaxi-service-with-self-driving-electric-microbuses/\">Volkswagen</a>, Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/uber-to-launch-a-premium-robotaxi-service-in-waymos-turf-of-san-francisco/\">premium robotaxi service</a> using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving system from San Francisco-based startup Nuro.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These deals are finally beginning to materialize into commercial services. For instance, Uber and Waymo launched a robotaxi service earlier this year in Austin. Now, Uber has expanded to the Middle East with WeRide in Abu Dhabi — with even more cities to come, including Dubai.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi forecast in the company’s third-quarter earnings report that there would be autonomous vehicle deployments on the Uber network <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/407969754/files/doc_events/2025/Nov/04/Uber-Q3-25-Prepared-Remarks.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in at least 10 cities</a> by the end of 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber and WeRide have previously shared plans to expand to 15 cities throughout the Middle East and Europe, eventually scaling to thousands of robotaxis. That would represent a massive leap for WeRide, which today has more than 150 robotaxis in the region.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
