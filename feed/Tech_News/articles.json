            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI research lab Anthropic’s not slowing down in its efforts to snap up enterprise clients. The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/snowflake-anthropic-expanded-partnership\">$200 million multi-year AI deal</a> that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform, and consequently, to its sizable customer base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in a blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It’s a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic in October signed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/deloitte-goes-all-in-on-ai-despite-having-to-issue-a-hefty-refund-for-use-of-ai/\">deal with Deloitte</a> to bring its Claude chatbot to the consulting giant’s employee base of more than 500,000 staff. That same week, Anthropic struck a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-and-ibm-announce-strategic-partnership/\">partnership with IBM</a> to bring some of its LLMs into the latter’s software products.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s enterprise success isn’t surprising as the company’s models have garnered strong and growing traction among enterprises. A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">Menlo Ventures survey</a> in July found that enterprises preferred Anthropic’s AI products over models by other AI companies.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The European Commission on Thursday <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2896\">said</a> it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp in October <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">changed its business API policy</a> to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Meta is found guilty of breaching EU’s antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp, for its part, called the EU’s claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies’ chatbots. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai and Bengaluru, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/07/indias-nexus-venture-partners-announces-new-450m-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">operated as a single fund</a> and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abhishek Sharma, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars or around $1 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus, which operates with an eight-member investment team, began with a $100 million fund and has kept its fund size at $700 million since <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/tech/funding/nexus-venture-partners-closes-its-largest-ever-fund-at-700-million/articleshow/98329133.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launching Fund VII in 2023</a>. It typically raises every 2.5 to 3 years. Bhattacharjee said the reason for keeping the eighth fund the same size was the firm believes $700 million is the right amount for its early-stage strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though India’s AI journey is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not as advanced as the U.S.’s</a> in many areas, Nexus believes India could leapfrog in several parts of the AI ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bhattacharjee underlined the country’s large talent pool, rising digital infrastructure, and demand for localized models that support India’s many languages and service needs. These dynamics, he said, are pushing Indian startups to build AI applications and agents faster, often atop open-source tools and emerging domestic AI infrastructure companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partners pointed to companies backed by Nexus, such as Zepto and Neysa, to illustrate how AI is taking shape in India. They said Zepto, the quick-commerce platform, uses AI extensively across its operations — from customer support to routing and fulfillment — demonstrating how consumer businesses are becoming deeply AI-native. Besides, infrastructure players like Neysa are emerging to address India-specific needs, including sovereign AI workloads, localized data handling and support for the country’s many languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nexus did not share fund metrics. The partners said its funds have been realizing significant enough returns over the years to largely fill this fund from returning limited partners. The firm’s LP base spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Japan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This year, people around the world were most curious about everything from <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/what-is-hot-honey-11716837\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hot honey</a> and AI chatbots to the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before we get into the specifics, it’s worth noting that Google’s report doesn’t reflect the overall most popular searches. If it did, the list would be filled with general terms like “weather” rather than trending topics. Instead, Google’s “Year in Search” highlights queries that saw a sustained spike in traffic in 2025 compared with 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That being said, the top trending search of the year was “Gemini,” which is Google’s AI chatbot, followed by “India vs England” and “Charlie Kirk.” Gemini wasn’t the only AI chatbot to make the list, as DeepSeek ranked seventh among the year’s trending searches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, Google says Charlie Kirk was the top trending news topic, with the query “Charlie Kirk assassination” leading the list. The second and third trending news queries were “Iran” and “US Government Shutdown,” respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for recipes and food, the top spot went to the sweet-and-spicy condiment hot honey, while Marry Me Chicken and chimichurri rounded out the top three.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For movies, the top trending search was “Anora” followed by “Superman” and the “Minecraft Movie.” The top trending search for actors went to “Anora” star Mikey Madison. Lewis Pullman, who starred in Marvel’s “Thunderbolts,” took the second spot, followed by Isabela Merced, who was featured in “Superman.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of sports, “FIFA Club World Cup” was the top trending search, followed by “Asia Cup” and “ICC Champions Trophy.” The top searched sports team was Paris Saint-Germain F.C., while the second and third were S.L.

The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as Hubspot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Formerly known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/frances-sendinblue-an-all-in-one-digital-marketing-platform-raises-160m/\">Sendinblue</a>, Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.brevo.com/blog/becoming-brevo/\">new name</a> reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&amp;M.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upwards. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After joining the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/the-age-of-the-centaur-100m-arr-is-the-new-cloud-valuation-milestone/\">centaur club</a> in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time, and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Delivers-Record-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Results-Driven-by-Agentforce--Data-360/default.aspx\">$41.55 billion</a> in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and also to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured. (Brevo claims “double-digit EBITDA margin.”)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These coffers have already supported Brevo’s plans to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.maddyness.com/uk/2025/02/17/brevo-to-invest-e50m-in-ai-over-five-years/\">invest €50 million in AI</a> over five years, and to use <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/11/2793572/0/en/Brevo-Acquires-WonderPush-and-Octolis.html\">acquisitions</a> (11 to date) as one of its growth levers. The 1,000-employee company now intends to use its new funding to support these two endeavors, alongside its push in the U.S., on which it plans to spend over €100 million, according to a press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brevo didn’t disclose the exact valuation resulting from its latest round. It did give more details on its updated cap table. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rumors had described the deal <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pe-insights.com/general-atlantic-and-oakley-capital-near-e1bn-acquisition-of-crm-software-firm-brevo/\">as Brevo getting acquired</a>, but Thiberge said Brevo’s management and employees still hold the largest share (26%) while new entrants General Atlantic and Oakley Capital each bought 25%; existing investors Bpifrance and Bridgepoint collectively retained 24%, while <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://it.sendinblue.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/06/SendinBlue_Release_Funding-091217-1.pdf\">Series A lead Partech</a> completed its exit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This makes for a global cap table that mirrors Brevo’s stated ambition to “build a global European CRM leader capable of competing with U.S. players through product excellence.” In other words, not through playing the European sovereignty card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Thiberge, “whoever has the best product wins, and it’s a race to see who can make the product that is both the most complete and the easiest to use.” There’s an inherent tension to doing this, and to catering both to mid-market companies and very small businesses. “I’m not saying it’s easy every day […] but for us, this combination has been incredibly successful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To serve this diverse audience, Brevo has significantly expanded beyond its email marketing roots. While it still competes with Mailchimp in that space, the company now offers an all-in-one platform with marketing automation, CRM, customer data management, and communication across email, SMS, WhatsApp, live chat, push notifications, and even integrated sales calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These functionalities are also increasingly boosted by AI, either through integrations or in-house. Expanding this feature set is one driver of Brevo’s M&amp;A strategy, but inorganic growth from buying competitors in key markets is the other. With acquisitions expected to contribute 45% of its €1 billion revenue target for 2030, the company’s shopping list should be extensive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated to correct cap table details.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This year it’s all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AWS re:Invent 2025</a>, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. <br><br>“We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent.

Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier. <br><br>For instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure. The serverless model customization can be accessed through either a self-guided path or by prompting an AI agent.<br><br>AWS also announced Reinforcement Fine Tuning in Bedrock, which allows developers to choose a preset workflow or reward system and have Bedrock run their customization process automatically from start to finish.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-andy-jassy-shares-some-numbers\">Andy Jassy shares some numbers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took to social media platform X to expound on AWS chief Matt Garman’s keynote speech.

The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.duckbillhq.com/blog/aws-database-savings-plans-six-years-of-complaining-finally-pays-off/\">in his blog post</a>, “Six years of complaining finally pays off.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-t-get-a-better-deal-than-free-amazon-hopes\">Can’t get a better deal than free, Amazon hopes  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Is there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year’s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/amazon-hopes-to-jump-start-its-ai-coding-tool-kiro-by-giving-it-away-to-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+</a> to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-training-chip-and-nvidia-compatibility\">An AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS introduced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new version of its AI training chip</a> called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expanded-agentcore-capabilities\">Expanded AgentCore capabilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-announces-new-capabilities-for-its-ai-agent-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform</a>. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-nonstop-ai-agent-worker-bee\">A nonstop AI agent worker bee</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-nova-models-and-services\">New Nova models and services</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-launches-new-nova-ai-models-and-a-service-that-gives-customers-more-control/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">four new AI models</a> within its Nova AI model family — three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS’s big pitch is flexibility and customization.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lyft-s-argument-for-ai-agents\">Lyft’s argument for AI agents</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/aws-and-lyft-bringing-agentic-ai-to-life-for-riders-and-drivers\">piped up during the event</a> to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-factory-for-the-private-data-center\">An AI Factory for the private data center</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced “AI Factories”</a> that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Dye will focus on improving AI features in these devices and report directly to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Apple, Dye will be replaced by Steve Lemay, who has had “a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,” according to a statement Apple CEO Tim Cook gave Bloomberg.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems that Meta is recruiting from its competitors to help the company compete in the AI race, as Meta also poached researchers from OpenAI this summer. (Allegedly, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hand-delivered homemade <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-soup-story-openaai-employee-recruiting-attempt-2025-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">soup</a> to an OpenAI employee in a recruitment push; OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen said that he has since delivered his own soup to promising Meta recruits.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after the news broke of Dye’s departure, Zuckerberg <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DR0Wsy0EhCP\">announced</a> a new creative studio within Reality Labs that would be led by Dye. There, he’ll be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another former Apple designer who led interface design across Reality Labs; Joshua To, who led interface design across Reality Labs; Meta’s industrial design team, led by Pete Bristol; and its metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg said the studio would “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered,” the Meta CEO wrote on Threads. “We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated after publication with additional information about Meta’s plans.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/25/mrbeast-1-5-billion-valuation-youtuber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.5 billion valuation</a> left some onlookers incredulous — but Beast Industries ended up <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mrbeast-revealed-ownership-stake-beast-industries-feastables-2025-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raising at a $5 billion valuation last year</a>. Now we’re asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s getting to the point where even if you don’t have a child under the age of 15, you should know who MrBeast is. The North Carolinian Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast channel has over 450 million YouTube subscribers — more than any other YouTube channel — making him arguably the most successful social media star ever. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So it made sense when at the DealBook Summit, reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin asked MrBeast and Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, about going public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You want to have an IPO at some point, I imagine,” said Sorkin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At some point, we want to be able to give the 1.4 billion unique people around the world who has watched Jimmy’s content the last 90 days a chance to be owners of the company,” Housebold replied. Sounds pretty much like a yes, as we can’t imagine another practical way to give ownership stakes to over a billion people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other major creators, the MrBeast business expands <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/youtubers-arent-relying-on-ad-revenue-anymore-heres-how-some-are-diversifying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">far beyond YouTube ad revenue</a> and into a company called Beast Industries. Its biggest moneymaker is Feastables chocolate, which is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/mrbeast-makes-more-money-from-feastables-chocolate-than-youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more profitable</a> than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Housenbold also mentioned that Beast Industries plans to build a two-sided marketplace for creators and marketers to work together (this idea has been explored by many creator economy startups already). Plus, the company is planning to launch a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/mrbeast-reportedly-plans-to-launch-a-phone-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">phone company</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mrbeast-moving-beyond-youtube-financial-services-2025-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">financial services platform</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/mr-beast-theme-park-beast-land-saudi-arabia-lsff6t2b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">theme park</a> in Saudi Arabia.

Beast Industries is in an ongoing lawsuit with the ghost kitchen Virtual Dining Concepts for damaging his brand by selling “inedible” food from MrBeast Burger. Virtual Dining Concepts <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/mr-beast-sued-burger-company-100-million-1235689127/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">countersued</a> him for allegedly breaching his contract.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, after filming the first season of “Beast Games,” five contestants <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mrbeast-amazon-sued-beast-games-contestants-class-action-1236148181/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sued</a> Donaldson and Amazon for alleged mistreatment and sexual harassment on set. The heavily redacted lawsuit states that the show filmed in an environment that “systematically fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In conversation at DealBook, Donaldson said, “The big thing is, obviously, I learned why people don’t have 2,000 people compete in a show, because you’re creating a scenario where 1,999 aren’t happy, because they didn’t win … I don’t know how openly I’m allowed to speak, but obviously, yes, some people sue you. I’m sure people in here have been sued before because they just want to try to make money.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Housenbold cut in, “Listen, we’re always learning and getting better.” He was interrupted by laughter from the crowd. “Mistakes are part of success, so Season 2 is a lot better.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not that Beast Industries’ missteps would prevent it from going public eventually, especially if it moves past them and can build the management discipline needed to bear the scrutiny of being public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Donaldson wouldn’t be the first creator-run business to go public — but he could pull off the first creator IPO that actually works. The esports team FaZe Clan went public in a $725 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SPAC</a> but got <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23925149/faze-clan-gamesquare-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquired</a> a year later in 2023 for just $17 million. In November, Pinkfong — the company that made the most-watched YouTube video, “Baby Shark” — went public in Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“From day one, we’re a global media company, and now we’re working on monetizing that viewership, that fandom, and that trust we built,” Housenbold said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The platform hosts various interest-based and affinity communities, including military roleplaying games and LGBTQ solidarity groups. But Russia has laws designating public LGBTQ advocacy as “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/06/30/russia-rising-toll-of-lgbt-extremism-designation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">extremist activity.</a>“</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a translation of an article in <a href=\"https://tass.ru/obschestvo/25806963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TASS</a>, a state-owned Russian news agency, Russia’s communications agency cited the presence of LGBTQ content on the platform as one of the reasons behind the ban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the ban this afternoon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ban comes as Roblox faces broader safety and moderation challenges. Recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> have highlighted how the platform exposed some of its underage users to child predators.

(However, facial verification technology comes with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/06/the-growing-debate-over-expanding-age-verification-laws/\">safety concerns</a> of its own.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox has also <a href=\"https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-to-our-maturity-compliance-questionnaire/3860056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asked</a> developers to flag experiences that “are primarily themed on a sensitive social, political, or religious issue” so that the parents of users under 13 years old can decide if their children can access that content.

Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium <a href=\"https://x.com/ajassy/status/1996066784252969450\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on X</a> that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said the Trainium2 business “has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bedrock is Amazon’s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jassy said Amazon’s AI chip is winning among the company’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those “other GPUs” out there on the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That is, of course, Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/amazons-growing-private-label-business-is-challenge-for-small-brands.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">classic MO</a>, offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight in an <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/aws-tranium3-ai-is-the-best-inference-platform-in-the-world-ceo-says?page=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">interview with CRN</a>, about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it’s Anthropic.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,” Garman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Project Rainier is Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. It came <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-project-rainier-ai-trainium-chips-compute-cluster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">online in October</a>. Amazon is, of course, a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-invests-additional-4-billion-anthropic-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">major investor in Anthropic</a>. In exchange, Anthropic made AWS its primary model training partner, even though Anthropic is now also offered on Microsoft’s cloud <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-nvidia-and-anthropic-announce-strategic-partnerships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">via Nvidia’s chips. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is now also using AWS in addition to Microsoft’s cloud. But the OpenAI partnership couldn’t have contributed much to Trainium’s revenue because AWS is running it on Nvidia chips and systems, <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-open-ai-workloads-compute-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the cloud giant said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, only a few U.S. companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have all the engineering pieces — silicon chip design expertise, homegrown high-speed interconnect. and networking technology — to even attempt true competition with Nvidia. (Remember, Nvidia cornered the market on one major high-performance networking tech in 2019 when CEO Jensen Huang outbid <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/nvidia-to-buy-supercomputer-chipmaker-mellanox-for-6-9b-beating-intel-in-a-bidding-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Intel and Microsoft to buy InfiniBand hardware maker Mellanox</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, AI models and software built to be served up by Nvidia’s chips also rely on Nvidia’s proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software. CUDA allows the apps to use the GPUs for parallel processing compute, among other tasks. Just like the Intel versus SPARC chip war of yesterday, it’s no small thing to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/behind-plot-break-nvidias-grip-ai-by-targeting-software-2024-03-25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rewrite an AI app for a non-CUDA chip.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Amazon may have a plan for that. As we previously reported, the next generation of its AI chip, Trainium4, will be built to interoperate with Nvidia’s GPUs in the same system. Whether that helps peel more business away from Nvidia or simply reinforces its dominance, but on AWS’s cloud, remains to be seen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It may not matter to Amazon. If it is already on track to make multibillion dollars from the Trainium2 chip, and the next generation will be that much better, it may be winner enough.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. </em><strong><em>This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.</em></strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The previous fuel economy standard, set under the Biden administration, mandated fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031. The regulation change also reclassifies crossovers as cars instead of light trucks, and it eliminates automakers’ ability to trade electric vehicle credits.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates fuel economy rules under <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</a> (CAFE) Standards. Those rules, first enacted by Congress in 1975, dictate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. In 2024, automakers had to average 30.1 mpg across their fleets, which they beat, delivering 35.4 mpg, <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2025-12/CAFE-LD-2022-2031-Notice-of-Proposed-Rulemaking.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to CAFE calculations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump also said he would authorize the Department of Transportation to allow automakers to manufacture “really small cars” like the kind found in Japan and South Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The White House claims that existing regulations would have caused automotive prices to increase by $1,000 per vehicle. The previous Trump administration made the same argument in 2020, when it last rolled back fuel economy standards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since that rollback, though, the price of a new vehicle has <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SETA01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">climbed to new heights</a>, topping $50,000 on average, as automakers <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/buying-a-car/people-spending-more-on-new-cars-but-prices-not-necessarily-rising-a3134608893/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discontinued low-end models</a> to capitalize on consumers’ preferences for SUVs. Larger vehicles <a href=\"https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/why-are-new-cars-so-expensive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">use more material</a>, thus costing more to make, while also getting lower fuel economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consumers’ choices appear to run counter to the administration’s contention that lower fuel economies are in the car-buying public’s interests. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hybrids-help-sustain-us-clean-car-demand-despite-subsidy-cuts-2025-12-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hybrid sales are up</a> significantly this year over last and momentum continues. Hybrid sales grew 6% in October over the previous month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Experts <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/business/average-car-prices-fifty-thousand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">doubt</a> that lower fuel economy standards will change the trajectory of new vehicle prices. Many vehicles are developed with global markets in mind, and most of those still value efficiency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The rest of the world will continue to innovate and create cleaner cars that people want to buy and drive, while we’re forced to sit in our clunkers, paying more for gas, and pumping out more tailpipe emissions,” Gina McCarthy, former EPA administrator, said in a statement. “With their backwards thinking and never-ending efforts to create more pollution in this country, we are ceding the global car market and technological innovation to China.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, which eliminated penalties for automakers that don’t hit their marks, fuel economy standards have been essentially toothless. Instead, the regulatory move is likely intended to serve as a hurdle for future administrations to bring them back.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Already, automakers have been moving to sell more gas-guzzling vehicles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford has indefinitely paused production of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, shifting capacity in favor of internal combustion models. Stellantis reintroduced its Hemi V-8 engines, though a review of the powertrain in the Ram 1500 has revealed that it <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a65958660/2026-ram-1500-hemi-drive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">performs worse</a> in nearly every way than a more efficient inline-6.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not all automakers have decided to turn back, though. Hyundai is <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/sponsored/an-charging-ahead-hyundais-unwavering-commitment-to-vehicle-electrification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">still committed</a> to EVs, while its sibling Kia has given its EVs <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/778329/kia-ev6-ev9-niro-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$10,000 discounts</a> across the board.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At the company’s annual “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/12/sotw-2025/\">State of the Word</a>” event on Tuesday in San Francisco, WordPress project co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg shared several examples where Telex had been used within a working WordPress shop to do things like create price comparisons, price calculators, and pull in real-time business hours plus a map link to a retail store, among other examples.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Telex, which Mullenweg previously described as a “v0 or Lovable, but specifically for WordPress,” is essentially the publishing platform’s attempt to build its own vibe-coding tool for the AI era. The software allows developers to generate Gutenberg blocks — the modular bits of text, images, columns, and more — that make up a WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the software is still labeled as an experiment, Mullenweg was able to demonstrate several real-world examples that had been built by community creator Nick Hamze. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the first example, Mullenweg showed off a pricing comparison tool built with Telex, noting that these sorts of rich, interactive web elements were something

I can’t write a single line of code, but I can describe what I want to Telex, and it can make it for me. That freedom is intoxicating, and I’m all in on AI,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think as long as people think of these tools as ‘developer’ tools, they are missing the point on what they can really accomplish, which is letting regular folks do things they never could have done before,” Hamze added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Telex demos were discussed alongside other AI-focused initiatives at WordPress, including architectural developments, like the Abilities API and MCP adapter. The former defines what WordPress can do in a way that AI systems can interpret, the company <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/12/sotw-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">explained</a>, while the latter exposes those abilities so any <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/mcp-ai-agent-security-startup-runlayer-launches-with-8-unicorns-11m-from-khoslas-keith-rabois-and-felicis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MCP-compatible tool</a> can understand and use them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This adapter pattern means WordPress can participate in AI workflows without duplicating logic or creating separate integrations for every AI platform,” Mullenweg told event attendees. “So you can now connect a WordPress installation to popular tools like Claude, Copilot, and many other platforms that support MCP.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, he noted that developers were already using AI in their everyday workflows through tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other next-generation CLIs. This, Mullenweg said, “means you can refactor projects, search code bases, automate tasks, [and] run scripts with WP CLI alongside the AI agent.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mullenweg said that, in 2026, WordPress would introduce some benchmarks and evaluations that AI models can use to test on WordPress tasks, like changing plugins, editing text, or even manipulating the WordPress interface using browser agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated after initial publication with a comment from Hamze.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. </em><strong><em>This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.</em></strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early October, DualEntry, an AI enterprise resource planning (ERP) startup, announced a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/company-valued-415-million-2025-10-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$90 million Series A</a> round led by Lightspeed and Khosla Ventures, valuing the one-year-old business at $415 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company seeks to replace legacy software like Oracle NetSuite with its offering that can automate routine tasks and provide predictive insights. The massive funding round from top-tier VCs signaled that the startup is likely experiencing phenomenal revenue growth. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, one VC who declined to invest told TechCrunch that DualEntry’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) was just around $400,000 when he reviewed the deal in August. DualEntry’s co-founder, Santiago Nestares, denies that number. When asked about revenue when the deal closed, Nestares said it was “considerably higher than that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even so, an extremely handsome valuation relative to revenue is becoming an increasingly common investment strategy among top-tier VC firms. The tactic is known as “kingmaking.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This approach involves deploying massive funding into one startup in a competitive category, aiming to overwhelm rivals by granting the chosen company a bank-account advantage so significant that it creates the appearance of market dominance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kingmaking isn’t new, but its timing has shifted dramatically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Venture capitalists have always evaluated a set of competitors and then made a bet on who they think the winner is going to be in a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This early aggressive<strong> </strong>funding contrasts with the last investment cycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon,’” said David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures. He pointed out that massive funding into Uber and Lyft was a canonical example of this, but the capital weaponization for the ride-sharing companies didn’t begin until they reached their Series C or D rounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with Uber vs. Lyft, investors in DualEntry’s competitors Rillet and Campfire are evidently just as eager to see their bets succeed with the help of substantive capital. In early August, Rillet raised a <a href=\"https://www.rillet.com/blog/rillet-raises-70m-series-b-from-andreessen-horowitz-and-iconiq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$70 million Series B</a> led by a16z and Iconiq, just two months after the company closed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/rillet-raises-25m-from-sequoia-to-automate-general-ledger-systems-using-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$25 million Series A</a> led by Sequoia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Campfire AI had two back-to-back funding rounds. In October, it grabbed a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/campfire-raises-65-million-series-b-to-redefine-how-finance-works-in-the-ai-era-302585077.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$65 million Series B</a>, just a couple of months after announcing a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/tiny-ai-erp-startup-campfire-is-winning-so-many-startups-from-netsuite-accel-led-a-35m-series-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$35 million Series A</a> round led by Accel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI ERP is just one of the several AI application categories where startups are raising funding in rapid succession. “There’s no new data between rounds. Series Bs happen 27-60 days after Series As regularly,” Jaya Gupta a partner at Foundation Capital, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/JayaGup10/status/1989086174754058503\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted on X</a> last month. Besides AI ERP, she wrote that she sees this pattern in categories such as IT service management and SOC compliance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some startups like Cursor or Lovable have reportedly grown at a breakneck pace between their back-to-back rounds, several VCs told TechCrunch that’s not the case for all. AI ERPs and several other categories of startups that raised multiple rounds in 2025 still have ARRs in the single-digit millions, these investors said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although not all VCs agree that kingmaking is a sound investment strategy, there are reasons why offering large amounts of capital could be beneficial even when the startup maintains a modest burn rate. For instance, well-funded startups are perceived as more likely to survive by large enterprise buyers, making them the preferred vendor for significant software purchases. That’s a strategy that helped legal AI startup Harvey attract large law firm customers, investors say.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, history shows that massive capitalization offers no guarantee of success, with notable failures, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/01/flexport-acquires-technology-of-former-digital-freight-unicorn-convoy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">logistics company Convoy</a> and the bankruptcy reorg of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/20/bird-bankruptcy/\">scooter company Bird</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But those precedents don’t faze major VC firms. They prefer to bet on a category that seems like a good case for AI, and they would rather invest early because, as Peterson put it: “Everybody has fully internalized the lesson of the power law. In the 2010s, companies could grow faster and be bigger than almost anybody had realized. You couldn’t have overpaid if you were an early Uber investor.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. </em><strong><em>This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.</em></strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Dekoda <a href=\"https://www.kohlerhealth.com/purchase-flow/?section=membership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">costs</a> $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-html\" id=\"twitch-embed\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. </em><strong><em>This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.</em></strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/what-is-substrate-a-thiel-backed-chip-startup-seeking-to-crack-asml-s-dominance?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chasing after the same prize</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mina-fahmi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mina Fahmi</a>, who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">turns them into text</a>. Before you roll your eyes, know that he and co-founder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired. The Stream Ring isn’t trying to be your friend — it’s trying to extend your brain. Backed by Toni Schneider, an operator who scaled WordPress in its earlier days, Sandbar just emerged from stealth and might well be onto something. (Schneider is a partner at True Ventures, whose other hardware bets have included Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit; he’s also coming to Palo Alto tonight.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sciencecorporation_bringing-sight-to-the-blind-with-neural-engineering-activity-7292950930352726016-YI6a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Max Hodak</a> — Science Corp. founder, Time magazine <a href=\"https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cover subject</a>, and, earlier, Neuralink co-founder (along with Elon Musk) — who has already restored vision to dozens of blind people with retinal implants. Now he’s working on “biohybrid” brain-computer interfaces where chips seeded with stem cells grow into your brain tissue so paralyzed people can control devices with their thoughts. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, as Hodak views it. In fact, he thinks 2035 is going to look wildly different from today, and he’s happy to share how.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, we’re thrilled to welcome <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chchien\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chi-Hua Chien</a> of Goodwater Capital and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethweil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elizabeth Weil</a> of Scribble Ventures, two VCs who’ve backed Twitter, Spotify, TikTok, Slack, SpaceX, Figma, and Coinbase before they were household names. Chien runs Goodwater Capital; Weil founded Scribble Ventures after stints at Andreessen Horowitz and Twitter, made 100+ angel investments and has a first fund showing 4x returns.

Both think Silicon Valley is completely misreading the moment while everyone pours capital into enterprise AI, and they’ll explain why.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/strictlyvc-palo-alto/?utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=svcpaloalto&amp;utm_content=ticketsales&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=post_svcagenda_11242025&amp;display=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-destinationlink=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/strictlyvc-palo-alto/?utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=svcpaloalto&amp;utm_content=ticketsales&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=post_svcagenda_11242025&amp;display=\" data-event=\"clickable_image\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Pat Gelsinger , CEO, VMware, at the Web Summit in Altice Arena on November 08, 2017 in Lisbon, Portugal.\" class=\"wp-image-2095921\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=680,364 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=430,230 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=720,385 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=900,482 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=800,428 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=668,357 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=708,379 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-871704844.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Horacio Villalobos / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Playground Global is hosting, along with general partner <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/patgelsinger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pat Gelsinger</a>, the former CEO of Intel.

The company counts <a href=\"https://gomarquis.com/who-we-are/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 700 banking and credit union customers</a> on its website. As such, Marquis has access to and stores large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At least 400,000 people are so far confirmed affected by the data breach, according to legally required disclosures filed in the states of Iowa, Maine, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire that TechCrunch has reviewed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Texas has the largest number of state residents so far who had data stolen in the breach, affecting at least 354,000 people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis said <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/d8efd2f6-f52d-49d3-be53-028e9a8cb837.html?7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in its notice</a> with Maine’s attorney general that banking customers with the Maine State Credit Union accounted for the majority of its data breach notifications, or around one-in-nine people who are known to be affected throughout the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The number of individuals affected by the breach is expected to rise as more data breach notifications roll in from other states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis said the hackers stole customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, such as bank account, debit, and credit card numbers. Marquis said the hackers also stole customers’ Social Security numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to its most recent notices, Marquis blamed the ransomware attack on hackers who exploited a vulnerability in its SonicWall firewall. The vulnerability was considered a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day</a>, meaning the flaw was not known to SonicWall or its customers before it was maliciously exploited by hackers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis did not attribute the ransomware attack to a particular group, but the Akira ransomware gang was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/sonicwall-urges-customers-to-disable-sslvpn-amid-reports-of-ransomware-attacks/\">reportedly behind the mass-hacks</a> targeting SonicWall customers at the time. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch asked Marquis if it is aware of the total number of people affected by the breach, and if Marquis received any communication from the hackers or if the company paid a ransom, but we did not hear back by the time of publication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the Marquis data breach?
