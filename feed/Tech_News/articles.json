The war game was very <em>au courant</em>, running a scenario in which the U.S. and China fought for supremacy over Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liss’s take away from the exercise? “Our core supply chain of the arsenal of democracy — literally, the ships that my grandfather fought in — we don’t have the ship-building capacity. If we did, we don’t have the steel to make it,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that point, Liss said he became “really interested — obsessed, even” with the steel supply chain. “That was really the birth of Nemo Industries.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The basic pitch for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nemoind.com/\">Nemo Industries</a>, Liss’s latest startup, appears as though it were drawn from a Venn diagram of two very American anxieties, steelmaking and AI. The company, until now, has been operating in stealth, but Liss gave TechCrunch a peek behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, the obvious part: Nemo will use AI to optimize the production of pig iron, modernizing an industry that Liss said is woefully outdated. “These plants are run on, at best, Excel spreadsheets. At worst, clipboard technology,” he said. The people who run them have “unbelievable expertise,” he added, but that’s the sort of thing that doesn’t scale well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Liss isn’t pitching Nemo as just another piece of industrial software. Rather, Nemo is planning to build its own furnaces. The decision was driven by Liss’s conviction that companies which use AI from inception will have a “20% to 30% margin advantage” over competitors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In steelmaking, such conviction doesn’t come cheap. Hyundai Motor Group said in March that it would build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana to supply its factories in the U.S. Nemo’s plant may not cost that much since its operations will be focused on pig iron, an intermediate product which steelmakers use to make a range of different alloys.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nemo will fire its furnaces using natural gas, which releases less carbon dioxide than coal, which is commonly used in the iron and steel industry. Liss said the company is considering capturing the furnaces’ carbon pollution; tax incentives introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act remain largely intact, and they make the endeavor profitable for Nemo, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liss’s partner in Nemo is Michael DuBose, an investor who previously worked at Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company. “He’s built billions of dollars in LNG infrastructure,” Liss said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup will need that sort of scale if it’s to succeed. Nemo previously raised $28.2 million, according to PitchBook, and it is currently in talks with existing investors to raise a $100 million Series A with existing investors, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company also has received offers for over $1 billion in incentives from two southern states if the company can build three plants over the course of 15 years, the person said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a tall order for anyone to tackle, but Liss said that sort of ambition is required if the steel industry is going to deliver the sort of returns desired by venture capitalists. And, he added, basic industries like steel have historically delivered big wins for investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you look at the history of our country, many of the greatest companies that created outsize outcomes for their initial investors were in these categories,” Liss said. “Ultimately, what were the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and the Melons and the Fricks investing in? The dollar amounts are so big in these categories.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature, which will be available by clicking an icon just to the left of the web address in the browser, will display a pop-up that informs consumers about the store’s reputation for things like product quality, shopping, pricing, customer service, and returns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature, which is currently available only in English, will generate the summaries based on reviews from partners, including Bazaarvoice, Bizrate Insights, Reputation.com, Reseller Ratings, ScamAdviser, Trustpilot, TurnTo, Yotpo, Verified Reviews, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/190657?hl=en#Supported_Review_Partners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and others</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature will initially be available to Chrome on the desktop.

However, the feature also helps Google better compete with other AI features rolled out by retail giant Amazon, which has been using the new technology to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/amazon-taps-generative-ai-to-enhance-product-reviews/\">summarize product ratings and reviews</a>, help customers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/amazon-turns-to-ai-to-help-customers-find-clothes-that-fit-when-shopping-online/\">find clothes that fit</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/amazon-debuts-rufus-an-ai-shopping-assistant-in-its-mobile-app/\">get product recommendations and comparisons</a>, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes arrive as Google, for the first time in many years, is facing a potential competitive threat to Chrome’s dominance in the global browser market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New AI-powered browsers like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Perplexity’s Comet</a>, The Browser Company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/\">Dia</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/operas-new-browser-can-code-websites-and-games-for-you/\">Opera Neon,</a> and perhaps a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks/\">challenger from OpenAI</a> have the search giant thinking about how to infuse AI more directly into its own web browser. For example, Google is developing an AI agent that would be able <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/google-unveils-project-mariner-ai-agents-to-use-the-web-for-you/\">to take control of Chrome for you</a> to take actions on your behalf. Plus, the company recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3009785/gemini-is-now-in-chrome/\">added support for its Gemini AI assistant in Chrome</a> for Gemini subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move is also part of a broader initiative underway at Google to make it more of a modern-day shopping platform for consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Already, the company has tapped AI to help customers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/15/google-supercharges-shopping-tab-with-ai-and-personalized-recommendation-feed/\">locate the products they’re interested in</a>, get personalized product recommendations, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/googles-new-ai-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-clothes/\">virtually try on clothes</a>, and it has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-adds-ai-powered-shopping-features-for-discovery-and-easy-check-out/\">developing tools</a> for better price tracking, shopping in Google’s AI Mode, and AI-powered agentic checkout. (The latter two were announced at this year’s Google I/O developer conference. Google <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/back-to-school-ai-updates-try-on-price-alerts/\">recently announced</a> that getting outfit and room inspiration in AI Mode would roll out this fall.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

You also want scoops, a bit of a news roundup, and deals, but far and away you’re looking for analysis. I’ve always sprinkled my thoughts and insights throughout the newsletter, but over the next few weeks and months you’ll see me push further into analysis. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On that note, earnings season is upon us and two stood out to me: <strong>GM</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong>. Both companies are facing pressure from tariffs. And while GM also sells gas-powered vehicles, both are trying to sell EVs in a market that has seen growth slow while facing a future without EV incentives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How GM and Tesla plan to navigate this (or at least what they’re signaling) is quite different. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM, which saw tariffs take a $1 billion bite out of its Q2 line, still sees EVs as its “north star.” And while GM certainly trails Tesla in EV sales today, it has a bigger mix of EV models to attract customers — more than a dozen in all. And Chevrolet is now the No. 2 EV brand in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while GM did tout $4 billion of deferred revenue from its advanced driver-assistance system Super Cruise, along with OnStar and other software services that will be recognized over time, the big theme of the call was “flexibility.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Chair and CEO Mary Barra</strong> and <strong>CFO Paul Jacobson</strong> said the word “flexibility” nine times during the Q2 earnings call. What they mean by flexibility is setting up factories where they can easily assemble EVs and ICE vehicles — and change up the mix based on demand. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Tesla is betting heavily on the “future,” and for CEO Elon Musk that means autonomy and AI, or as he sometimes calls it, “real-world AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vast majority (about 74%) of Tesla’s revenue still comes from selling cars, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/tesla-profits-pulled-down-by-falling-ev-sales-and-regulatory-credits/\">although Q2 results</a> show a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue. But if you listened to the Q2 call, it’s clear that Elon Musk isn’t interested in Tesla being a car company. (He even admitted that the highly anticipated breakthrough cheaper model Tesla is working on is really just a stripped down version of the Model Y.)  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk wants to make and sell Optimus robots and deploy autonomous vehicles. The problem is that today these products — or future products — are not generating profits, let alone revenue. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, Tesla does bring in revenue from its advanced driver-assistance system known as supervised Full Self-Driving. (This is not an autonomous vehicle and requires human driver engagement.) And yes, the company is charging for robotaxi rides in South Austin, but it is not at scale, nor is it profitable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk acknowledged there would be some rough quarters ahead, but he still believes that ultimately this will be where the bulk of Tesla profits come from. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think that this transition is going to take far longer than Musk has publicly shared. (Just today, The Information reported the company is far behind on its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/tesla-is-reportedly-behind-on-its-pledge-to-build-5000-optimus-bots-this-year/\">Optimus robot production goal</a>.) And it seems the company is feeling the pressure to act. For instance, Tesla is reportedly bringing a limited version of its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/tesla-is-reportedly-bringing-a-limited-version-of-its-robotaxi-service-to-san-francisco/\">robotaxi service to San Francisco</a> this weekend even though it technically doesn’t have the required permits. (What do you think Tesla’s workaround will be?)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Tesla is under regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales and even threaten his future plans around FSD. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

The AI5, a generation that is primarily built for FSD, will initially be made in TSMC’s Taiwan factory and then at its Arizona facility. Samsung already makes the AI4 chip, according to Musk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is a boost for Samsung, which struggled to get its chip-making project off the ground after failing to attract and retain major clients. Musk said in another post that Tesla may end up spending more than $16.5 billion on Samsung chips. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Actual output is likely to be several times higher,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a later post, Musk said Samsung agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress. And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house,” Musk wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla switched over from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/teslas-computer-is-now-in-all-new-cars-and-a-next-gen-chip-is-already-halfway-done/\">Nvidia’s Drive platform</a> to its own custom chip in 2019. That chip, known as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/tesla-vaunts-creation-of-the-best-chip-in-the-world-for-self-driving/\">FSD Computer</a> (FSDC) or Hardware 3, launched that year in all of its EVs. The FSDC, made by Samsung, consists of two duplicate systems right next to each other on one board — a design choice meant to create redundancy required for any automated driving system. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the company’s attention to its custom chips has expanded along with its ambitions. The AI chips are the centerpiece of Tesla’s push to move from an automaker to an AI and robotics company. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For inference tasks, the H20 outperforms even the H100, an AI chip this administration has restricted access to due to its advanced capabilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter also claimed that selling the H20 chips in China will worsen the existing AI chip bottleneck in the U.S.; that these chips could be used to support China’s military; and that this decision will weaken overall chip export controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one,” the letter said. “We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge. This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter’s signatories include Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser during Trump’s first term; Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush; and David Feith, a former member of the National Security Council, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This letter comes two weeks after the DOC gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its AI chips in China again in relation to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/nvidias-resumption-of-h20-chip-sales-related-to-rare-earth-element-trade-talks/\">ongoing trade discussions with China regarding rare earth elements</a>. At the time, Lutnick tried to downplay the decision and said Nvidia’s H20 was the company’s “fourth best” AI chip.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, the Trump administration unveiled its AI Action Plan, which highlighted the need for U.S. AI chip export restrictions but was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-action-plan-aims-to-block-chip-exports-to-china-but-lacks-key-details/\">light on the details</a> of what those export controls would look like.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After the audit, <a href=\"http://itch.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Itch.io</a> said NSFW game creators will be required to confirm that their content is allowed under the policies of their payment processors linked to their account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On social media, users criticizing <a href=\"http://itch.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Itch.io</a>’s decision noted that its <a href=\"https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">current terms</a> declare that adult content violations are “permanent with no chance of appeal” and that any funds in an offending account “will not be eligible for payout” — or as one developer <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/gwenckatz.bsky.social/post/3luv4rdhsss2k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">put it</a>, “If you violate the rules, we take all your money. Not just the money from that work, ALL your money from EVERYTHING you’ve ever made.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is far from the first time that payment companies appear to have pressured online platforms over adult content — for example, last year Gumroad pointed to restrictions from payment processors when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/15/gumroad-no-longer-allows-most-nsfw-art-leaving-its-adult-creators-panicked/\">implemented stricter rules</a> around NSFW art, and OnlyFans also blamed “banking partners and payment providers” when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/\">banned explicit content</a> (a decision that it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/style/onlyfans-ban-reversed.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">subsequently reversed</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Change.org petition</a> with more than 137,000 verified signatures criticizes Mastercard and Visa for their role in these types of decisions. Among other things, the petition demands that the payment companies “stop censoring legal fictional content that complies with the law and platform standards” and “reject influence from activist groups that promote moral panic or misrepresent fiction as harm.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And it was at a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts that the company’s CEO Andy Byron and chief people officer Kristin Cabot were apparently caught dancing together on the “kiss cam.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Byron and Cabot (who are reportedly married to other people) awkwardly tried to hide from the camera, Martin joked, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Footage of the exchange exploded in popularity, ultimately leading both executives to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/19/astronomer-ceo-resigns-following-coldplay-concert-scandal/\">resign from Astronomer</a>. In announcing Byron’s resignation, the company said, “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Astronomer’s statement also nodded at the fact that the company had suddenly become famous for reasons having nothing to do with its product: “While awareness of our company may have changed overnight, our product and our work for our customers have not.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vich2C-Tl7Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new marketing video</a> has a similar message, attempting to refocus the conversation on Astronomer’s technology, while winkingly acknowledging why that might be a challenge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paltrow kicks things off by introducing herself as someone who’s been “hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employers at Astronomer.” She then promises to answer the “most common” questions asked about the company — but when the briefly glimpsed, half-typed questions are all about you-know-what, Paltrow remains cheerfully, and resolutely, on-message.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation,” she says.

After selling just the Chevy Bolt for years, a wave of new models — now up to 17 fully electrified vehicles — has pushed the automaker into second place in the U.S. behind Tesla. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How did it get there? With a little help from a Tesla veteran.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM board member Jon McNeill was president of Tesla during the development and introduction of the Model 3, a crucial period of the company’s growth. One of the things he credits for Tesla’s success is how Elon Musk ran product meetings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“No slides was our first rule,” McNeill told the audience earlier this month at TC All Stage in Boston. “You have to be reviewing real product.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every week, senior leadership would sit down with product leaders to review their progress. The practice was inspired by an encounter Musk had with Steve Jobs, McNeill said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There was this belief that I think is true: Steve Jobs didn’t have a ton of time or patience for Elon in the early days. And early in the early days, Elon would try to chase Steve down at events and parties in Silicon Valley for advice. And Steve didn’t like Elon, and so would often turn his back to him when he approached him. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But one night, Elon got lucky and said, ‘Steve, if you had one piece of advice for me as a young entrepreneur’ — he had just done PayPal and was joining the team at Tesla — ‘what would that be?’ Steve said, ‘Elon, you’re now in the hardware business, but the hardware business is a lot like the software business. If you want to be successful in business, you have to get one thing right, and that is, you have to have a perfect product. And if the product is beautiful, it will sell itself.’”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk took that to heart, McNeill said, and the concept of a perfect product became central to product development at Tesla.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The thing we were looking for first of all was surprise and delight. Like, are we doing something that is going to just make somebody go wow or laugh or have fun? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Crazy example of that is the fart button,” McNeill said, referring to a software button labeled “Emissions Testing Mode” that would simulate flatulence through the car’s speakers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also prized minimalism, which on the software side meant keeping functions accessible in fewer than two taps on the screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It has to be a kind of a no-brainer for the average user. Then we would double back the designer — the lead designer was always in the room — and then we would say, OK, Franz, now make it beautiful.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meetings like those, where the actual product was reviewed, not a mock-up, helped preserve Tesla’s culture as it grew, McNeill said. “You can imagine the culture that gets communicated when people are bringing their A game to the CEO every week. Because you’re not going to bring your B game to the CEO — especially that CEO, because he’s going to fire you,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That keeps that company on a one-week cadence of innovation. Every week they’re making progress because of the product reviews.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McNeill left Tesla in early 2018. In 2022, he was added to the board at GM. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the things I’m most proud of is Mary Barra, CEO, and Mark Reuss, president, [who oversee] a 275,000 person, $200 billion revenue company, are running product reviews every week where there’s no slides. You’ve got to see the real product [whether it’s] hardware, software. If it’s hardware, it’s in the room. You’re touching it. You’re feeling it,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That stuff is so powerful. And it’s led to GMs introduction of 17 EVs, now the second best selling EVs in the country. Because they’re just on product, every week.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to the spokesperson, Allianz Life has 1.4 million customers. Its parent company, Allianz, has more than 125 million customers worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Allianz Life said it notified the FBI and added it had “no evidence” that any other systems on its network were compromised. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The insurance giant would not say if it had received any communication from the hackers, such as a ransom note. The company also would not attribute the breach to a hacking group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Allianz Life is the latest company in the past month to have been hacked during a wave of data breaches targeting the wider insurance industry, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/us-insurance-giant-aflac-says-customers-personal-data-stolen-during-cyberattack/\">including Aflac</a>, a major provider of supplementary health insurance. Security researchers at Google said in June that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/us-insurance-giant-aflac-says-customers-personal-data-stolen-during-cyberattack/\">they were “aware of multiple intrusions” across the insurance sector</a> attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and techniques that rely on social engineering methods, such as deceptively calling and tricking help desks into granting them access to a company’s network. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to targeting insurance companies, the Scattered Spider hackers were seen <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/marks-spencer-confirms-customers-personal-data-was-stolen-in-hack/\">targeting the U.K. retail industry</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/fbi-cybersecurity-firms-say-scattered-spider-hackers-now-targeting-airlines-transportation-sector/\">aviation and transportation sectors</a>, and are historically known for hacks <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/23/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-scattered-spider-hackers/\">targeting Silicon Valley technology giants</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the Maine filing, Allianz plans to begin notifying affected individuals around August 1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the Allianz Life cyberattack? Are you an affected customer or employee?

The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles, and requires permits for all three stages: testing with a driver, testing without a driver, and driverless deployment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla holds a permit for testing autonomous vehicles with a human safety operator behind the wheel. It doesn’t have a permit for driverless testing or deployment. And as of Wednesday it had not yet applied for additional permits, according to the DMV. (Mercedes-Benz, Nuro, and Waymo are the only three companies that hold driverless deployment permits.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nor does Tesla have the proper permits from the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates the commercial aspects of ride-hailing and chartered transportation by humans as well as those steered by autonomous vehicle systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has a Transportation Charter Party permit, which allows a human driver to drive a traditional vehicle (not an AV) for charter services with the public, CPUC spokesperson Terrie Prosper told TechCrunch in an email. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is distinctly different from an autonomous vehicle permit for passenger transportation, according to Prosper. So-called AV authorizations, which Tesla doesn’t have, allows for the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles with or without a driver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has not received approval from the CPUC to offer autonomous passenger service to customers, paid or unpaid, with or without a driver (nor has the company applied), Prosper explained in the email. Tesla also doesn’t hold a “Drivered Pilot AV permit” from the CPUC, so it cannot even use an autonomous vehicle with a human operator behind the wheel for passenger service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means that if Tesla deploys its robotaxis and the autonomous systems are engaged it will be violating state regulations even if the rides are free and there is a human safety operator behind the wheel. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push into California comes as the DMV is currently trying to <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/california-dmv-claims-tesla-misled-drivers-driving-capabilities-looks-suspend-business-30-days/17234677/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stop Tesla from selling vehicles</a> in the state as part of a years-long lawsuit over the promises the company has made about its cars’ self-driving abilities. Tesla is also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/22/tesla-california-dmv-autopilot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">currently on trial in a lawsuit</a> over deaths related to the use of its less-capable driver assistance system, Autopilot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has also yet to prove that its Full Self-Driving software can be used to power a robotaxi network. While the company has been running an invite-only version of its robotaxi service in Austin since June 22, it’s been a far cry from what Musk has spent years teasing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The service is mostly limited to Austin’s downtown core and main corridors. There is a safety operator in the front passenger seat who can intervene if the car is about to do something wrong or dangerous. While the service launched with around 10 vehicles, it’s not clear how many Model Y SUVs are in operation in the city, nor is it clear how many times those safety operators have had to intervene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a long way from the “general solution” that Musk said Tesla was working on for a decade. Musk was once so confident in the autonomous software Tesla was developing that he said it would take a car from Los Angeles to New York — a stunt that never happened. Musk said this week that Tesla is also trying to expand to Florida and Arizona. TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/tesla-is-already-trying-to-expand-its-robotaxi-service-to-arizona/\">reported earlier this month</a> that Tesla had begun the required certification process to test and operate with and without a driver in Arizona.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: This story has been updated to include new information from the CPUC. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The order affects lesser-known, but wildly popular services like Ullu and ALTT that cater to the country’s mass-market appetite for adult and edgy entertainment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued directives to block access to websites and apps linked to 25 streaming services, citing provisions of the Information Technology Act of 2000 and the IT Rules of 2021, TechCrunch learned.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order came months after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology raised concerns about mature content being streamed on these platforms without adequate safeguards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government contacted internet service providers and app stores, including Google Play and the Apple App Store, earlier this week to restrict these streaming services, a source privy to the matter told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of these services, especially the major ones with millions of subscribers, remained live at the time of filing this article.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. The information and broadcasting minister also did not respond to an email sent Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of the 25 streaming services, 10 offered in-app purchases through their apps on Google Play and the App Store, generating a cumulative $5.7 million since launch with nearly 105 million downloads, per the Appfigures data exclusively shared with TechCrunch. The wide gap between in-app purchases and downloads is primarily due to their low subscription costs — significantly lower than Netflix and other global platforms in India.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031363\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg 1265w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=300,235 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=768,602 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=680,533 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=1200,941 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=430,337 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=720,565 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=900,706 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=800,627 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=668,524 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=478,375 478w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=787,617 787w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=677,531 677w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-streaming-services-in-app-purchases-downloads_66d3f4.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1265px) 100vw, 1265px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Lifetime totals of banned streaming services from Google Play and Apple App Store</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, some of these streaming services were either never listed on traditional app stores or had been removed earlier, and instead offered their apps as direct APK downloads.

The service’s iOS app, however, was not available for download from the Indian App Store.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ullu Digital, the parent company of Ullu, reported a net profit of ₹212.3 million ($2.5 million) for the financial year 2024, per its regulatory filing reviewed by TechCrunch.

Global platforms, including Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, often <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/netflix-bows-to-censorship-stops-streaming-uncut-indian-films-globally/article67641054.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">face instances of censorship</a> by the Indian government.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, even stricter actions are seen in cases of obscenity despite a lack of clarity on regulations, as watching explicit content featuring fully consensual interactions between adult actors in a private space <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cant-stop-an-adult-from-watching-porn-in-his-room-says-sc/article7400690.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is not a crime</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, the then Indian information broadcasting minister warned streaming platforms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/20/india-wont-tolerate-abusive-obscene-content-on-streaming-services-minister-warns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not to serve abusive and obscene content</a>. New Delhi has also blocked <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/did-india-porn-ban-reduce-traffic-popular-adult-sites/article67247600.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands of websites streaming pornographic content</a>. On a plea to regulate sexually explicit content in April this year, India’s Supreme Court also <a href=\"https://www.medianama.com/2025/04/223-supreme-court-ott-sexual-content-plea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">issued notices</a> to streaming platforms and the Indian government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, curbing obscene content remains a challenge even for the Indian government. Smaller streaming services — like those targeted in this crackdown — often reappear under new names, apps, and domains. It is equally difficult for intermediaries like Google, Apple, and internet providers to fully block access, as these platforms often spread through alternative channels and use social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube to attract viewers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early-stage founders just can’t get away from TAM — the concept of having a total addressable market for their startup to disrupt and conquer. But Index Ventures partner <a href=\"https://www.indexventures.com/team/jahanvi-sardana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jahanvi Sardana</a> has a reminder for all those founders worried about finding TAM for their product or service: Many startups have emerged from markets that, at the time, were essentially nonexistent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What was the market for search before Google?” Sardana asked the audience at TechCrunch’s 2025 All Stage event in Boston, held earlier this month. “What was the market for operating systems before Microsoft, or the market for cloud before Amazon?” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sardana compares TAM to surfing. Every few years, there are massive waves founders must ride — first came the internet, then the mobile wave, then the cloud, and now, she said, the biggest wave of all: artificial intelligence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Have you shaped the right product to ride this wave?” she continued. “That’s what we call product-market fit.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Which TAM bucket are you in?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sardana places TAM into three buckets: known market, emerging market, and invisible market. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first, known market, already exists, and it is when a founder seeks to replace a legacy incumbent and must prove to an investor why their startup idea is better. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everyone brushes their teeth,” she said. “You have to tell me why you’re building a better toothbrush.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The emerging market is when a certain sector of the market is using a product, and there is potential for it to go mainstream.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think about non-alcoholic beer before it became cool,” Sardana said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there is the invisible market, which Sardana calls “the biggest trap,” and “also a little bit of a dark art.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market doesn’t exist, and a founder has to essentially create one and provide investors with evidence of how innovative they can be. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think about smartphones in 2006; nobody knew they wanted them and they changed the world,” she said, later adding that “people don’t know what they’re looking for and sometimes you have to show them what’s possible.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The audience at All Stage, many of whom are early-stage founders, peppered Sardana with questions, largely about what investors want to see. For instance, do investors want to see a TAM slide in a pitch deck? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s OK to create that slide and talk about the math behind your TAM,” Sardana said, though she added that sometimes investors get annoyed when founders rely too much on industry metrics rather than having their own unique insight. Sardana also cautioned founders not to rely too much on industry reports. If a founder is too dependent on an external service to dictate how they think about the market, it can signal that they haven’t thought deeply about the market they are trying to build in, she commented.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How do you size the TAM in the marketplaces, especially big marketplaces?” one audience member asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Well, that question hurts,” Sardana quipped. After all, Index once passed on Airbnb, having believed its TAM was too small. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reality is Airbnb created a whole new inventory, which is now bigger than some of the largest hotel brands, and that led to a big change in behavior on how people travel,” she said, adding that marketplace TAMs are tricky. “You want to focus on, again, what is unlocking supply, and once you unlock the supply, how will behavior change?” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The audience also asked Sardana what makes a company stand out to an investor like herself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A tough one, Sardana said, but a really important one. Ultimately, if a founder can understand who the customer is and why they are willing to purchase their product, then a company should have no problem standing up to investors, she added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in the business of evaluating founders more than markets or products or anything else,” she said. “When you talk about your market, it’s really a lens on your ambition.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
