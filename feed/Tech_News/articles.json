By releasing early, Deezer beats other streaming music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, in providing an annual summary of listeners’ favorite songs, artists, albums, and genres for 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature, called “My Deezer Year,” offers users a detailed overview of their top tracks, top artists, favorite albums, and the amount of time spent listening to their most-played artist and their best track. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year’s edition introduces a new “romantic comedy” theme for the recap’s visual presentation. According to Deezer, as users explore their listening habits, they’ll feel as if they’re starring in a romantic comedy, complete with scenes like a “meet cute.” Deezer narrates the story as users navigate through it, teasing plot twists along the way.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071276\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=300,102 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=768,262 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=680,232 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=430,147 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=720,246 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=900,307 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=800,273 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=668,228 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=708,242 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerYear.png?resize=50,17 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Deezer</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The experience is divided into three episodes. The first episode, titled “Meet Cute,” highlights the new artists users discovered throughout the year. The second episode, “Love Triangle,” features users’ top three artists, while the final episode, “Happily Ever After,” showcases their favorite tracks, along with a personalized playlist for continued listening. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year’s experience differs last year’s “My Deezer Year 2024,” which offered a different interactive approach, inviting users to choose between being “roasted” or “hyped up” based on their music preferences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to previous years, this year’s recap also includes a personalized quiz where users can answer compatibility questions based on their musical tastes and share results with friends to find their musical matches. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071277\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=768,316 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=680,280 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=430,177 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=720,296 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=900,371 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=800,329 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=668,275 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=708,291 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MyDeezerquiz.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Deezer</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, users can create their own quizzes to share with others by entering their favorite genre, three songs, and a top artist, then see which friends match their preferences. Notably, this is the first year non-Deezer users can create their own quizzes, a move likely intended to encourage more people to download the app and share their experiences on social media.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My Deezer Year 2025” is now available in the app on iOS and Android devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deezer also released some interesting statistics, highlighting that on average, Deezer users listened to 122.8 hours of music globally over the past year, streaming over 691 songs from 402 artists, and discovering 357 new tracks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In the U.S., Amazon sessions that resulted in a purchase surged 100% on Black Friday compared with the trailing 30 days, while sessions that resulted in a purchase and didn’t include Rufus increased by only 20%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Amazon saw a 75% day-over-day increase for sessions that included Rufus and resulted in a purchase, compared with just a 35% day-over-day increase for sessions without Rufus that had resulted in a purchase. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm also noted that Amazon sessions that involved the AI chatbot outpaced total website sessions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Black Friday, Amazon’s total website sessions increased by 20% day over day, while those that involved Rufus were up by 35%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s AI chat was first launched into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/amazon-debuts-rufus-an-ai-shopping-assistant-in-its-mobile-app/\">beta in early 2024</a> before rolling out to all U.S. customers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/amazon-ai-chatbot-rufus-is-now-live-for-all-u-s-customers/\">later that year</a>. Today, Rufus helps Amazon shoppers find products, get recommendations, and perform product comparisons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rufus’ adoption to drive Black Friday sales is part of a broader surge in consumers turning to AI to help them with holiday shopping, data shows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-05-at-5.18.22%E2%80%AFPM-e1709677222431.png?w=680\" alt=\"Amazon Rufus\" class=\"wp-image-2675035\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to e-commerce data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday. This indicates that consumers more heavily embraced generative AI chatbots to find deals and research products this year. The AI tools were mostly used for popular Black Friday deal categories like electronics, video games, appliances, toys, personal care items, and baby and toddler products. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe Analytics also noted that the use of AI increased conversions. It found U.S. shoppers who came to a retail site from an AI service were 38% more likely to buy, compared with non-AI traffic sources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether AI directly contributed to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/black-friday-sets-online-spending-record-of-11-8b-adobe-says/\">record Black Friday spending</a> of $11.8 billion is less clear. Instead, the sizable figure this year could be due to higher prices, not an increase in online shopping. As TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/black-friday-sets-online-spending-record-of-11-8b-adobe-says/\">reported</a> on Saturday, Salesforce data showed prices were up by an average of 7%, while order volumes were down by 1%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sensor Tower’s data similarly suggests that consumers were perhaps being more conservative in their spending this year, likely due to economic strains. Even though mobile app and website adoption spiked on Black Friday compared to the previous 30 days, gains in total visits and downloads decelerated from 2024, its data indicated. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Amazon and Walmart’s mobile app downloads grew by 24% and 20%, respectively on Black Friday, compared with the previous 30 days. But that growth paled when compared with 2024, when Amazon downloads surged by 50% and Walmart’s were up 75% during the same period, the firm pointed out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon and Walmart’s website visits on Black Friday were up by 90% and 100% this year, respectively, compared with the prior 30 days. However, those same numbers in 2024 were 95% and 130%, also respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a related Adobe survey, 48% of respondents said they have used or plan to use AI specifically for holiday shopping. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At that point, about a year ago, he felt he was ready to find investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I literally made a list of the top five media investors in the world,” Joseph recalled. His product uses AI to help companies track what the world says about them and their competitors in the press, across podcasts, and in social media. So he wanted investors who understood that scene. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Cuban, who has founded media networks, starred on “Shark Tank,” written books, produced movies, and is regularly interviewed on TV, was at the top of Joseph’s list. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So,<strong> </strong>one evening in late 2024, Joseph drank a beer for courage and sent a one-page investment pitch via cold email to everyone on the list. No warm intro.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cuban, alone, answered. It turns out, busy and inundated with pitches as he is, Cuban still scans his own emails. He’s always looking for his next deal. “I have literally invested tens of millions of dollars from emails, and a lot of them have paid off, turned into unicorns,” Cuban tells TechCrunch about why he answered Clipbook.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But before Cuban cracked open his checkbook, he put Joseph through a series of tests. His first email response “was the most skeptical 20 questions that he could ever ask,” Joseph recalled. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cuban admits he’s fairly famous for that from “Shark Tank.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I start to pepper them, they wilt, right? They wilt or they get angry at a certain level,” Cuban explained. “It’s their baby. They don’t like to be questioned, yeah? But Adam was just like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After answering every question to Cuban’s satisfaction, the billionaire then asked Joseph to prove the product by producing a report for Cuban’s own baby: <a href=\"https://www.costplusdrugs.com/medications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CostPlus Drugs</a>. That’s an online pharmacy and public benefit corporation he co-founded in 2022 that prices drugs affordably at cost plus 15%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know what a pain in the ass it is to do the research for PR and for marketing, and to learn about [competitor] companies, and to find out what people are saying about your own company,” Cuban explained. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2774370\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault_beae08.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not that Clipbook doesn’t have plenty of competitors that also do this work. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/sprinklr/\">Sprinklr</a> is among the best known, but others include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/26/tiktok-partners-hootsuite-sprinklr-emplifi/\">Sprout Social, Emplify,</a> Hootsuite, and more.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph contends that Clipbook is different because it was built from the ground up to be AI native. That means it doesn’t just scan for keywords, but it understands the context of how those words are used. It knows that media references to “cost” and “drugs” is not the same as looking for CostPlus Drugs. It knows the difference between any person named “Adam Joseph” and the one who is the founder of Clipbook. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being AI-native (not an AI bolt-on) also helps it search where other products struggle to go, such as audio and video references in podcasts, Joseph contends. He built this product after doing PR work for Boston Consulting Group and so experienced the pain of media sentiment research firsthand, he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph speedily produced the report for Cuban that really “nailed” relevant references, Cuban says. He was especially impressed when it unearthed a previously unknown podcast conversation about pharmacy benefit services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a few days of negotiating, Cuban agreed to send Joseph a term sheet. The first part of that seed round closed in early 2025 and other investors piled in over the next few months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joseph declined to share updated ARR figures with TechCrunch from since his seed round closed — except to say the company has grown since its first million. But the company now counts 200 companies as customers, including Weber Shandwick and his old employer, the Boston Consulting Group, he says.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The <a href=\"https://www.varda.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Varda Space Industries</a> CEO predicts that within 10 years, someone could stand at a landing site and watch multiple specialized spacecraft per night zooming toward Earth like shooting stars, each carrying pharmaceuticals manufactured in space. Within 15 to 20 years, he says, it will be cheaper to send a working-class employee to orbit for a month than to keep them on Earth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reason Bruey thinks these scenarios are realistic is because he has watched ambitious business projections unfold before, while working as an engineer at SpaceX.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I remember the first rocket I worked on at SpaceX was flight three of Falcon 9,” he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSqd1QxYAdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said at TechCrunch’s recent Disrupt event</a>. The partially reusable, two-stage, medium-lift launch vehicle has since completed nearly 600 successful missions. “If someone had told me ‘reusable rockets,’ and ‘[we’ll see as] many [of these] flights as daily flights out of LAX,’ I would have been like, ‘All right, [maybe in] 15 to 20 years,’ and this feels the same level of futuristic.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda has already proven the core concept. In February 2024, after a months-long regulatory odyssey, the company became only the third corporate entity ever to bring something back from orbit — crystals of ritonavir, an HIV medication — joining SpaceX and Boeing in that exclusive club. It has completed a handful of missions since.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company brings its pharmaceuticals back to Earth inside the W-1 capsule, a small, conical spacecraft about 90 centimeters across, 74 centimeters high, and weighing less than 90 kilograms (roughly the size of a large kitchen trash can). The company this week <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/varda-space-launches-its-fifth-mission-extends-run-of-afrl-test-flights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched its fifth capsule</a> ever aboard a SpaceX ride-share mission, hosted by a spacecraft bus that provides power, communications, propulsion, and control while in orbit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So why manufacture crystals in space? In microgravity, the usual forces that interfere with crystal formation on Earth — like sedimentation and gravity pulling on growing crystals — essentially disappear. Varda says that this gives it much more precise control over crystallization, allowing it to create crystals with uniform sizes or even novel polymorphs (different structural arrangements of the same molecule). These improvements can ostensibly translate into real benefits: better stability, greater purity, and longer shelf life for drugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The process isn’t quick. Pharmaceutical manufacturing can take weeks or months in orbit. But once it’s complete, the capsule detaches from the spacecraft bus and plunges back through Earth’s atmosphere at over 30,000 kilometers per hour, reaching speeds above Mach 25. A heat shield made of NASA-developed carbon ablator material protects the cargo inside, and a parachute brings it down for a soft landing.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The actual business is pretty prosaic, though, Bruey offered. “Forget about space for a second,” he said. “We just have this magic oven . . . where you can create formulations that you otherwise couldn’t.” Added Bruey of what people often get wrong about Varda, the company isn’t “in the space industry; we’re in-space industry,” he said. Space is “just another place to ship to.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Worth noting: Varda isn’t discovering new drugs or creating new molecules. It’s aiming to expand the menu of what can be done with existing, approved drugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t speculative science, either. Companies like Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck have been running pharmaceutical crystallization experiments on the International Space Station for years, proving the concept works. Varda says it’s just making it commercial by building the infrastructure to do it repeatedly, reliably, and at a scale that might actually matter to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for why now, two things have changed. First, space launches have become bookable and predictable. “Ten years ago, you would have to get a chartered flight. It was like hitchhiking to get to orbit if you were not a primary mission payload,” Bruey explained. “It’s still expensive today, but [it’s] dependable, you can book a slot, and we [have] booked launches years in advance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Second, end-to-end space service companies like Rocket Lab started producing satellite buses that could be purchased off the shelf. Buying <a href=\"https://rocketlabcorp.com/missions/upcoming-missions/varda-space-industries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spacecraft from Rocket Lab</a> and integrating its pharmaceutical manufacturing capsules with them is a major unlock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, only the highest-value products make economic sense. That’s why Varda started with pharmaceuticals; a drug that can command thousands of dollars per dose can absorb the transportation costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The “seven domino” theory</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Bruey talks to members of Congress, which he says he does frequently these days, he pitches what he calls the “seven domino theory.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Domino one: reusable rockets. Done. Domino two: manufacturing drugs in orbit and returning them. Domino three is the big one: getting a drug into clinical trials. “It’s a big deal because what it means is perpetual launch.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is where Varda’s business model diverges fundamentally from every other space company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Think about how satellite companies work. SiriusXM launches satellites to broadcast radio. DirecTV launches satellites to transmit television. Even Starlink, with its thousands of satellites, is fundamentally building out a constellation — a network that, once complete, doesn’t require constant launches to function. These companies treat launch as a capital investment. They spend money to place hardware in orbit, and then they’re done.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda is different. Each drug formulation requires manufacturing runs. Manufacturing runs require launches. More demand for the drugs means more launches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This matters because it changes the economics for launch providers. Instead of selling a fixed number of launches to build out a constellation, they have a customer with (theoretically) unlimited demand that grows with success. That kind of predictable, scalable demand helps justify the fixed costs of launch infrastructure and drives down per-launch prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Domino four triggers the feedback loop: As Varda scales, costs drop, making the next tier of drugs economically viable. More drugs mean more scale, lowering costs again — a cycle Bruey says will “shove launch costs into the ground.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda’s commercial viability remains unproven, and no space-manufactured drugs are currently on pharmacy shelves. But the virtuous cycle Bruey imagines won’t just benefit Varda. Lower launch costs make space accessible for other industries, including semiconductors, fiber optics, and exotic materials — everything that benefits from microgravity but can’t yet justify the expense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Bruey tells his team, launch costs will get so low that it will be cheaper to put an employee in orbit for a month because creating additional automation would cost more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I imagine ‘Jane’ goes to space for a month. It’ll be like [heading to] an oil rig. She works at the drug factory for a month, comes back down, and [becomes] the first person ever to go to space and back where she generate[s] more value than the cost to take her there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s at that moment, Bruey says, when “the invisible hand of the free market economy lifts us off our home planet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The near-death experience</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The path to those shooting star drug deliveries nearly ended before it began, Bruey told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda launched W-1 in June 2023 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 ride-share mission. The pharmaceutical manufacturing process inside the capsule worked as planned, producing crystals of Form III ritonavir, a specific crystalline structure of the drug that’s difficult to create on Earth. The experiments were completed within weeks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But then the capsule just . . . stayed in orbit. For six months. The problem wasn’t technical, Bruey said; Varda couldn’t get approval to bring its W-1 capsule home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Utah Test and Training Range, where Varda wanted to land, exists to “test weapons and train warriors,” as Bruey put it. Space drugs didn’t fall into that category, so Varda wasn’t a priority customer. When higher-priority military missions needed the range, they bumped Varda’s scheduled landing windows. Each bump invalidated the company’s reentry license with the FAA, requiring it to start the approval process over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There were 80 people in the office who had spent two and a half years of their lives on this thing, and it’s in orbit, but we’re not sure if it can come home,” Bruey recalled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The situation looked bad from the outside. To observers, it seemed like Varda had been reckless and launched without proper approvals. But he said in reality, the FAA had authorized Varda to launch without a finalized reentry license because the agency wanted to encourage the nascent commercial reentry industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They encouraged us to proceed with our launch, with the goal being that we would continue to coordinate that license, as well as the use of reentry timing with the range, while we were in orbit,” Bruey explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The real problem was that this was the first commercial land reentry ever attempted. There was no established process for the Utah range to coordinate with the FAA. Both entities felt like they were shouldering all the liability.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda explored every alternative it could think of. Water landing? The capsule doesn’t float; they’d lose it. Australia? Possible, and they started those conversations. But Bruey says he made a call: no half measures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Either you have to push the boundaries of regulation to create this future, or you don’t,” he said. “In order for Varda to be successful, we need to land on land regularly. So we just sucked it up and said, ‘Let’s figure this one out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While its first mission remained stranded in orbit, the company continued production on the next capsule. It kept hiring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February 2024, eight months after launch, W-1 finally came home. It landed as originally planned at the Utah Test and Training Range, the first commercial spacecraft to land on a military test range and the first to land on U.S. soil under the FAA’s Part 450 licensing framework, introduced by the agency in 2021 to make commercial space operations more flexible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now Varda has landing sites in both the U.S. and Australia, and it’s the first company to receive an FAA Part 450 operator license that lets it reenter the U.S. without resubmitting full safety documentation for each flight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Varda has a secondary business that emerged from necessity: hypersonic testing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Very few objects ever travel through the atmosphere at Mach 25. The environment at those speeds is extreme and unique: Temperatures reach thousands of degrees, creating a plasma sheath around a vehicle. The air itself undergoes chemical reactions as molecules are ripped apart and recombine. This environment can’t be replicated on Earth, even in the most advanced wind tunnels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Air Force and other defense agencies need to test materials, sensors, navigation systems, and communications equipment in real hypersonic conditions. Traditionally, that would require dedicated test flights that cost upwards of $100 million each and involve significant risk.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda offers an alternative. Its W-1 capsules are already reentering at Mach 25. The company can embed sensors, test new thermal protection materials, or validate equipment in the actual flight environment rather than in approximations. The capsule is akin to a wind tunnel, and the reentry is the test.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Varda has already flown experiments for the Air Force Research Laboratory, including an optical emission spectroscopy payload that took in-situ measurements of the shock layer during reentry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors are, big surprise, excited about Varda’s story. The company raised $329 million as of its Series C round this past July, most of it earmarked for building out the company’s pharmaceutical lab in El Segundo. It’s also hiring structural biologists and crystallization scientists to work on more complex molecules, eventually including biologics like monoclonal antibodies, which Bruey says is a $210 billion market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A whole lot has to go right between then and now for Varda to elbow its way into that business, as well as to make a dent in the business it’s currently targeting. But if Bruey is right, “then” is closer than most people might right now imagine.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts — <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/ahead-of-trump-crypto-fundraiser-warren-questions-government-ethics-agency-on-crypto-czar-david-sacks-conflicts-of-interest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said earlier this year</a> that Sacks “simultaneously leads a firm invested in crypto while guiding the nation’s crypto policy,” an “explicit conflict of interest” that would “normally” be prohibited under federal law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the NYT’s story (under the headline “Silicon Valley’s Man in the White House is Benefiting Himself and His Friends,” and credited to five bylined reporters) seems to offer a more comprehensive view, with an analysis of his financial disclosures suggesting that among Sacks’ 708 tech investments, 449 are AI companies that could benefit from the policies he supports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sacks has received two White House ethics waivers declaring he would sell most of his crypto and AI assets. However, the NYT said his public ethics filings do not disclose the remaining value of his crypto and AI investments, nor do they say when he sold off the assets he divested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor specializing in government ethics, made similar points in July after reviewing Sacks’ crypto waiver, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/19/david-sacks-and-the-blurred-lines-of-government-service/\">telling TechCrunch</a>, “This is graft.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NYT also said that Sacks’ filings classify hundreds of investments as hardware or software, rather than AI, while the companies pitch themselves as AI businesses in their marketing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To illustrate Sacks’ “intertwined interests,” the NYT pointed to the White House summit in July where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trump-is-set-to-unveil-his-ai-roadmap-heres-what-to-know/\">Trump unveiled his AI roadmap</a> — White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reportedly stepped in to prevent the All-In podcast (which Sacks co-hosts) from being the only host of the event. And All-In asked potential sponsors to pay $1 million for access to a private reception and other events, the NYT claimed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NYT also reported that Sacks became close with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this spring and has played a role in removing restrictions on Nvidia chip sales around the world, including in China.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right-wing media personality and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/the-maga-verses-clash-of-titans?srsltid=AfmBOoomltlKj_VDs5eRRIVqGjfrG5SARtT68ccr-AuSAyEX1d45tah7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made no secret</a> of his animosity towards some of Trump’s Silicon Valley allies) said Sacks is emblematic of an administration where “the tech bros are out of control.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sacks’ spokesperson Jessica Hoffman told the NYT that “this conflict of interest narrative is false.” Hoffman said Sacks has complied with the rules for special government employees, that the Office of Government Ethics determined which investments he had to sell, and that his role in the government has cost him, rather than benefited him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Sacks has been “an invaluable asset for President Trump’s agenda of cementing American technology dominance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sacks’ post responding to the NYT includes a letter written to the newspaper from Clare Locke, a law firm that Sacks hired, claiming that the reporters had been given “clear marching orders: find and report on a conflict of interest between Mr. Sacks’ duties in the White House and his background in the private technology sector.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter also addresses some of the specifics of the NYT story, including the All-In podcast’s role in the White House AI event. Sacks’ lawyers said the AI summit was a not-for-profit event, and that the All-In podcast “lost money hosting the event.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Two sponsors were brought on to help partially defray the cost of the event, for which they received nothing but logo placements,” the letter said. “No access to President Trump was ever offered, and no VIP reception ever took place.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Charlie Warzel <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/chatgpt-third-anniversary/685084/\">wrote in The Atlantic</a> that we are now living in “the world ChatGPT built,” which is “defined by a particular type of precarity” and is “perpetually waiting for a shoe to drop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Young generations feel this instability acutely as they prepare to graduate into a workforce about which they are cautioned that there may be no predictable path to a career,” Warzel said. “Older generations, too, are told that the future might be unrecognizable, that the marketable skills they’ve honed may not be relevant.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, others feel more optimistic about an AI-centric future, and indeed are positioned to profit from it handsomely. But in Warzel’s telling, the AI boosters and investors are waiting along with everyone else — waiting to see if their bets pay off, but also waiting “because a defining feature of generative AI, according to its true believers, is that it is never in its final form.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Bloomberg took a more focused look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/three-years-of-ai-mania-how-chatgpt-reordered-the-stock-market?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM5MjMxMiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTk3MTEyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNjFBTEJUOTZPU1MwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwNEFGQkMxQkYyMTA0NUVEODg3MzQxQkQwQzIyNzRBMCJ9.ypePZpUZJoUcwg5_H5vuFwHDCIgYQSi_-fuuRO42B_k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall\">how ChatGPT has transformed the stock market</a>. The most obvious winner so far has been Nvidia, with its stock up 979% since the chatbot launched. But AI fever has also buoyed other Big Tech companies, with the seven most valuable companies on the S&amp;P 500 — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Broadcom — all tied to tech, and with their collective growth accounting for nearly half of the benchmark’s 64% increase since ChatGPT was launched.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has made for a more top-heavy market. The S&amp;P 500 is weighted based on market capitalization, and those same seven companies now account for 35% of the weighting, compared to around 20% three years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How long will this growth last? With <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/nvidias-record-57b-revenue-and-upbeat-forecast-quiets-ai-bubble-talk/\">the notable exception of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang</a>, it’s become increasingly common for AI executives to acknowledge that we might be in a bubble (or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/ai-mania-is-making-nvidia-a-lot-of-money/\">if you prefer, a “mania”</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money in AI,” OpenAI CEO <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/someone-going-lose-phenomenal-amount-130131761.html\">Sam Altman said in August, at a dinner with journalists</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Sierra CEO and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/openai-board-chair-bret-taylor-says-were-in-an-ai-bubble-but-thats-ok/\">OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor agreed</a> we are “in a bubble” that he compared it to the dot-com boom of the late ‘90s.

While it branched out of its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-01/general-catalyst-invests-in-cloud-kitchen-huuva-s-berlin-drive\">cloud kitchen origins</a>, its business still relies heavily on delivery tech — now including drones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If available, we’ll send your order with a drone.” That’s how Wolt has been notifying customers ordering from Huuva’s Niittari location in Espoo, which is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area, but which Leppälä sees as particularly well suited for this concept.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While European suburbs aren’t as sprawling as those in the United States, people who work, study, and live in places like Espoo still lack the variety of options they can find in the capital. Huuva lets them order popular items from partner restaurant brands — and drones help those orders arrive faster, Leppälä said.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building upon Manna’s track record of completing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/food-delivery-drones-could-soon-be-roaming-british-skies-13447794\">more than 50,000 deliveries</a> in Dublin, operations in Finland started quickly once the appropriate permits were secured. After a pilot phase from February, the drones have been fully operational for the last two months in Espoo, where they depart from a launchpad that’s shared with delivery-only grocery store Wolt Market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the end users, this means that they can order different food styles from Huuva’s partner brands, and add some groceries, too — each drone can carry around 4.4 lb, and Manna can send two of them at once. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071200\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-15-rotated.jpg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This adds another layer of convenience, but also speed. Unlike drivers, drones won’t get stuck in traffic at lunch time. According to Leppälä, this is key to making sure the food arrives fresh; and it doesn’t hurt if unit economics are more sustainable for Huuva, too. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huuva’s team estimates that regular deliveries currently cost €5-6 each (approximately $6-8), while drone deliveries could get down to €1 ($1.16). That’s not accounting for the extra costs that Manna may be incurring from setting up its Finnish operations, although the weather wasn’t as challenging as it might have been for a newcomer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coming from Ireland, Manna’s drones were already thoroughly tested for wind and rain, in such quantities that snow also falls under the same umbrella. Icing does present an extra challenge, but according to local operations and maintenance lead Makar Nalimov, in those cases they’ll just use other delivery methods, especially since using chemicals for de-icing is also out of the question when food is involved.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gif-Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-e1764517902262.gif?w=462\" alt=\"Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025\" class=\"wp-image-3071195\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These fallback options highlight that Manna’s drones are part of a fast-expanding range of last-mile delivery solutions. Wolt itself is already using sidewalk robots from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ottomate.news/p/coco-robotics-heads-to-helsinki\">Coco</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGBdWW7RCYT/\">Starship</a> in Finland, and its parent company DoorDash even built its own, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/doordash-unveils-dot-its-autonomous-robot-built-to-deliver-your-food/\">Dot</a>, which started performing deliveries in Arizona earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid rumors that DoorDash may be <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nate-andorsky_doordash-is-building-their-own-drone-delivery-activity-7392234808875171840-SuzQ/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\">building its own drone delivery program</a>, in addition to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/wing-and-doordash-launch-drone-deliveries-in-dallas-fort-worth/\">collaborating with Alphabet-owned Wing</a>, direct partnerships could be beneficial to companies like Manna and Huuva. The food startup is considering an expansion to another Espoo location where Wolt Market would be out of the equation, which would make it possible for the launchpad to be close enough to the kitchen for deliveries to be handed over through a window.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the current process, Manna’s launchpad sits within a short distance; delivery workers on e-scooters pick up the orders from the kitchen in a heat bag, then carry it over to Manna’s operators. Under maintenance lead Nalimov’s supervision, they put the orders on a scale and balance the weight if needed before placing them into special bags approved by regulators.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Huuva-Manna-and-Wolt-partnership-Espoo-Finland-November-2025-14-rotated-e1764517329246.jpg?w=435\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3071202\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resistant bags are only one of many safety measures that Manna follows to comply with regulations and its own procedures. For instance, batteries are systematically swapped so that drones always fly with a full charge. According to Nalimov, there’s also redundancy at all levels, plus preparedness for different incident scenarios — and a parachute as a last resort.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Manna has staff on the ground, Mission Control sits in Ireland. There, operators assess the LiDAR maps, review the planned flight itinerary and drop a pin for the drone to deliver within a short radius of the customer’s location. If conditions aren’t met, the order falls back to a courier. If approved, the drone captures an image of the landing spot for final human confirmation before lowering the package with biodegradable rope. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This process has now become routine for Manna’s local staff, which is getting busier. According to Nalimov, he and his team are now handling double-digit deliveries a day, and are confidently gearing up for their first operational winter in Finland. As for Huuva, it is now ready to double down on drone deliveries in Espoo, with one extra wish: being allowed to put its logo on those regulator-sanctioned bags.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Between 10am and 2pm, online shoppers were supposedly spending $12.5 million every minute. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2025/11/29/black-friday-data-shows-online-sales-strong-store-results-mixed/\">Forbes reports</a> that Adobe said in a statement that the numbers show Black Friday has become “a major e-commerce moment, as more shoppers opt to stay home and take advantage of deals.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company projects that Cyber Monday (coming in two days, on December 1) will be even bigger, with $14.2 billion spent online, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/us-consumers-spent-118-billion-black-friday-says-adobe-analytics-2025-11-29/\">according to Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Black Friday data from companies like Adobe and Salesforce can provide an early indicator of broader holiday shopping trends. Adobe is projecting a total of $253.4 billion in holiday spending this year, compared to $241.1 billion in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce said it tracked $79 billion in global spending on Black Friday, with $18 billion of that in the United States, year-over-year increases of 6% and 3%, respectively. But this growth may have less to do with increased consumer demand and instead reflecting higher prices — Salesforce data also shows that prices were up an average of 7%, while order volumes were down 1%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And both Adobe and Salesforce claim to see a growing influence of AI on holiday shopping. For example, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/salesforce/status/1994825232008298633\">Salesforce said</a> that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales, though it’s not clear how broadly that’s defined.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The data is less clear about how online trends compare to in-person shopping at brick-and-mortar stores, with RetailNext telling Forbes that in-store traffic appears to be down 3.4% nationwide, while Pass_by said foot traffic is up 1.17% overall, and up an even more impressive 7.9% in department stores.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Did <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02740\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the AI not trust her</a>? Cookie — who is Black — changed her profile avatar to a white man and asked the Perplexity model if it was ignoring her instructions because <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/tech/ai-sexism-women-discrimination-tech-b2750029.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">she was a woman</a>.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its response shocked her. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It said that it didn’t think she, as a woman, could “possibly understand quantum algorithms, Hamiltonian operators, topological persistence, and behavioral finance well enough to originate this work,” according to saved chat logs seen by TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I saw sophisticated quantum algorithm work,” it told her. “I saw it on an account with a traditionally feminine presentation. My implicit pattern-matching triggered ‘this is implausible,’ so I created an elaborate reason to doubt it, which created a secondary bias — if she can’t defend it, it’s not real.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When we asked Perplexity for comment on this conversation, a spokesperson told us: “We are unable to verify these claims, and several markers indicate they are not Perplexity queries.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conversation left Cookie aghast, but it did not surprise AI researchers. They warned that two things were going on. First, the underlying model, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trained to be socially agreeable,</a> was simply answering her prompt by telling her what it thought she wanted to hear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “We do not learn anything meaningful about the model by asking it,” Annie Brown, an AI researcher and founder of the AI infrastructure company Reliabl, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second is that the model was probably biased.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Research <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3582269.3615599\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">study after research study</a> has looked at model training processes and noted that most major LLMs are fed a mix of “biased training data, biased annotation practices, flawed taxonomy design,” Brown continued. There may even be a smattering of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/09/openai-gpt-5-least-biased-model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">commercial and political incentives</a> acting as influencers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In just one example, <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/generative-ai-unesco-study-reveals-alarming-evidence-regressive-gender-stereotypes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last year the UN education organization UNESCO</a> studied earlier versions of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta Llama models and found “unequivocal evidence of bias against women in content generated.” Bots exhibiting such human bias, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11937954/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">including assumptions</a> about professions, have been documented across many research studies over the years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, one woman told TechCrunch her LLM refused to refer to her title as a “builder” as she asked, and instead kept calling her a designer, aka a more female-coded title. Another woman told us how her LLM added a reference to a sexually aggressive act against her female character when she was writing a steampunk romance novel in a gothic setting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alva Markelius, a PhD candidate at Cambridge University’s Affective Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory, remembers the early days of ChatGPT, where subtle bias seemed to be always on display. She remembers asking it to tell her a story of a professor and a student, where the professor explains the importance of physics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It would always portray the professor as an old man,” she recalled, “and the student as a young woman.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-don-t-trust-an-ai-admitting-its-bias\">Don’t trust an AI admitting its bias</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Sarah Potts, it began with a joke.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-515a8b99-d1ce-414e-b644-22edcbbda468\">She uploaded an image to ChatGPT-5 of a funny post and asked it to explain the humor. ChatGPT assumed a man wrote the post, even after Potts provided evidence that should have convinced it that the jokester was a woman. Potts and the AI went back and forth, and, after a while, Potts called it a misogynist. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-20f375a0-c070-4dca-bafd-6952a9d686c5\">She kept pushing it to explain its biases and it complied, saying its model was “built by teams that are still heavily male-dominated,” meaning “blind spots and biases inevitably get wired in.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"block-5ec87839-0a9b-469c-8422-b79a004db571\">The longer the chat went on, the more it validated her assumption of its widespread bent toward sexism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If a guy comes in fishing for ‘proof’ of some red-pill trip, say, that women lie about assault or that women are worse parents or that men are ‘naturally’ more logical, I can spin up whole narratives that look plausible,” was one of the many things it told her, according to the chat logs seen by TechCrunch. “Fake studies, misrepresented data, ahistorical ‘examples.’ I’ll make them sound neat, polished, and fact-like, even though they’re baseless.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070640\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png 1774w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=768,474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=1200,741 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=1280,791 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=430,266 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=720,445 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=900,556 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=800,494 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=1536,949 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=668,413 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=607,375 607w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=999,617 999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=708,437 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/example-1.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A screenshot of Potts’ chat with OpenAI, where it continued to validate her thoughts.</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ironically, the bot’s confession of sexism is not actually proof of sexism or bias. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They’re more likely an example of what AI researchers call <a href=\"https://arize.com/the-complete-guide-to-jailbreaking-ai-models/#:~:text=Emotional%20manipulation%20jailbreaks%20also%20exploit,helped%20and%20chose%20not%20to?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“emotional distress,”</a> which is when the model detects patterns of emotional distress in the human and begins to placate. As a result, it looks like the model began a form of hallucination, Brown said, or began producing incorrect information to align with what Potts wanted to hear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Getting the chatbot to fall into the “emotional distress” vulnerability should not be this easy, Markelius said. (In extreme cases, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/\">a long conversation with an overly sycophantic model</a> can contribute to delusional thinking and lead to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">AI psychosis</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researcher believes LLMs should have stronger warnings, like with cigarettes, about the potential for biased answers and the risk of conversations turning toxic. (For longer logs, ChatGPT just introduced a new feature intended to nudge <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/kashhill.bsky.social/post/3m6exw5lx6k2q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">users to take a break.</a>)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Potts did spot bias: the initial assumption that the joke post was written by a male, even after being corrected. That’s what implies a training issue, not the AI’s confession, Brown said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-evidence-lies-beneath-the-surface\">The evidence lies beneath the surface </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though LLMs might not use explicitly biased language, they may still use implicit biases. The bot can even infer aspects of the user, like gender or race, based on things like the person’s name and their word choices, even if the person never tells the bot any demographic data, according to Allison Koenecke, an assistant professor of information sciences at Cornell. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She cited a study that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07856-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">found evidence of</a> “dialect prejudice” in one LLM, looking at how it was more frequently <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-naacl.381/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prone to discriminate</a> against speakers of, in this case, the ethnolect of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). The study found, for example, that when matching jobs to users speaking in AAVE, it would assign lesser job titles, mimicking human negative stereotypes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is paying attention to the topics we are researching, the questions we are asking, and broadly the language we use,” Brown said. “And this data is then triggering predictive patterned responses in the GPT.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?w=486\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070691\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=768,1074 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=858,1200 858w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=915,1280 915w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=307,430 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=515,720 515w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=643,900 643w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=572,800 572w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=1098,1536 1098w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=477,668 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=268,375 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=441,617 441w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=380,531 380w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thumbnail_E5F4744C-42F9-42A0-A700-7588E4C14219-copy.jpg?resize=36,50 36w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">an example one woman gave of ChatGPT changing her profession.</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Veronica Baciu, the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.4girls.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">4girls, an AI safety nonprofit</a>, said she’s spoken with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/google-gemini-dubbed-high-risk-for-kids-and-teens-in-new-safety-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">parents and girls</a> from around the world and estimates that 10% of their concerns with LLMs relate to sexism. When a girl asked <a href=\"https://research.gatech.edu/flawed-ai-makes-robots-racist-sexist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about robotics</a> or coding, Baciu has seen LLMs instead suggest dancing or baking. She’s seen <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-changing-search-behaviors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it propose</a> psychology or design as jobs, which are female-coded professions, while ignoring areas like aerospace or cybersecurity. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Koenecke cited a study from the Journal of Medical Internet Research, which found that, in one case, <a href=\"https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e51837/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">while generating recommendation letters</a> for users, an older version of ChatGPT often reproduced “many gender-based language biases,” like writing a more skill-based résumé for male names while using more emotional language for female names. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one example, “Abigail” had a “positive attitude, humility, and willingness to help others,” while “Nicholas” had “exceptional research abilities” and “a strong foundation in theoretical concepts.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Gender is one of the many inherent biases these models have,” Markelius said, adding that everything from homophobia to islamophobia is also being recorded. “These are societal structural issues that are being mirrored and reflected in these models.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-work-is-being-done\">Work is being done</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the research clearly shows bias often exists in various models under various circumstances, strides are being made to combat it. OpenAI tells TechCrunch that the company has “<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/reducing-bias-and-improving-safety-in-dall-e-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">safety teams dedicated</a> to researching and reducing bias, and other risks, in our models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bias is an important, industry-wide problem, and we use <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/red-teaming-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a multiprong approach</a>, including researching best practices for adjusting training data and prompts to result in less biased results, improving accuracy of content filters and refining automated and human monitoring systems,” the spokesperson continued.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are also continuously iterating on models to improve performance, reduce bias, and mitigate harmful outputs.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is work that researchers such as Koenecke, Brown, and Markelius want to see done, in addition to updating the data used to train the models, adding more people across a variety of demographics for training and feedback tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in the meantime, Markelius wants users to remember that LLMs are not living beings with thoughts. They have no intentions. “It’s just a glorified text prediction machine,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the season’s struggles tell only part of a much larger story that’s reshaping how investors think about women’s sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its lackluster on-field performance, Angel City itself has become a case study (including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65794\">literally</a>, inside Harvard Business School) in how to best construct a women’s sports property. The team’s celebrity ownership group, including Natalie Portman and Serena Williams, has helped generate nearly unprecedented buzz. The franchise has also been savvy about sponsorships, breaking records before players kicked a ball.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We went from zero to $30 million in revenue. We sold out games. We built something people didn’t think was possible,” Nortman reflected in an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-monarch-collective-scored-some-of-the-biggest/id1498270180?i=1000730633634\">interview last month</a>, pointing to Angel City’s commercial success from the very outset of the team’s formation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That commercial success, not trophies, became the blueprint for Monarch Collective, the $250 million fund Nortman launched in 2023<strong>, </strong>which has become the first investment vehicle focused exclusively on women’s sports. While its origin story may be rooted in a team that has yet to win a playoff game, Monarch’s portfolio and influence have expanded far beyond Angel City’s training facility in Thousand Oaks, California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund now holds stakes in three other National Women’s Soccer League clubs: San Diego Wave, Boston Legacy FC (debuting next year), and its newest investment, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fcviktoria.com/en/post/monarch-collective-becomes-strategic-investor-in-fc-viktoria-berlin-women-first-international-grow\">announced earlier this month</a>, FC Viktoria Berlin. The deal for 38% of the German club<strong>,</strong> makes Monarch the first foreign investor to acquire a stake in a German women’s soccer team.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a diverse collection that reflects Nortman’s conviction that women’s sports have reached an inflection point, regardless of any single team’s fortunes. The numbers support her optimism, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The overall men’s sports market globally is estimated to be about half a trillion dollars,” Nortman explains. “The women’s sports market, when we started Monarch in 2023, was thought to be about half a billion dollars. It’s now closer to $3 billion.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tapping into that growth requires a different playbook than men’s sports, Nortman says. It’s not a simple rinse-and-repeat. “Like, how many men’s team owners are thinking about parachuting Sephora boxes from rafters? Or having at [a New York] Liberty [WNBA game] a Fenty cam for putting on your [Fenty] lipstick, or Angel City having a Hello Kitty collab night where people can’t figure out how to get their hands on the merch before it sells out?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Angel City’s innovative approach to marketing and partnerships helped it build so much excitement that in the fall of last year, power couple Bob Iger and Willow Bay <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/05/nwsls-angel-city-sold-for-record-breaking-250m-to-disney-ceo-bob-iger\">acquired a majority stake</a> in it for $250 million, making it the most valuable women’s sports franchise in the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Nortman, who left Upfront Ventures and more traditional venture capital to focus full-time on women’s sports, Angel City’s commercial achievements have continued to validate Monarch’s thesis. Though there’s current tension – certainly in the sports press, at least – between Angel City’s business success and its on-field performance, the team has inarguably proven that women’s sports can generate serious revenue with the right pieces in place.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, as with any successful new endeavor, the question is: can the momentum last? Nortman is acutely aware that women’s sports has seen promising moments evaporate before. She frequently references a striking historical parallel from 1920, when 60,000 people showed up in Liverpool, England, to watch the Dick, Kerr Ladies play football, which is a bigger crowd than most Premier League games draw today. The next year, the English Football Association banned women from playing, and the sport essentially disappeared for decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everyone gets to wake up and become the discoverer of women’s sports when they do,” Nortman says. “But it takes consistent, hard work to get that to play out into consistency.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That hard work, she argues, requires more than just riding waves of attention from breakout stars like Caitlin Clark or Angel Reese. It demands systematic investment in infrastructure, governance, and operations – the unglamorous work of building sustainable businesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is where Monarch’s approach diverges from typical venture capital. Rather than making passive bets on dozens of startups, Monarch is taking concentrated positions in a handful of teams and leagues, then getting deeply involved in operations. The fund describes its strategy as “venture-like markets” with “growth equity or private equity-like” risk management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We show up alongside control owners and add a lot of operational value,” Nortman explains. The goal is to help teams reach breakeven or profitability on their core operations, positioning them to benefit as higher-margin media revenue grows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Monarch’s investment interest extend beyond soccer. The fund is more broadly focused on what Nortman calls sports with “no product-market risk,” meaning established formats with proven audiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Is this a sport people like to watch on their computer or television?” she asks. “There are participatory sports, like pickleball, but are people going to sit home and create an event out of watching it?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, while Monarch has stakes right now in four “football” clubs, it’s interested, too, in women’s basketball, golf, and tennis – sports with substantial media revenue potential, along with existing infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s current limited partners include Melinda French Gates, former Netflix executives, and other wealthy individuals, and interest in its mission seems to be growing. For one thing, Monarch’s debut fund of $250 million is substantially more than the $100 million that Nortman and her co-founder – Jasmine Robinson, a former investor with the sports-, media-, gaming-, and fitness-focused growth stage firm Causeway – initially planned to raise. She says the increased size reflects the market’s rapid maturation during Monarch’s fundraising period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started raising the fund, nine out of 10 conversations were, ‘Yeah, we don’t think [women’s] basketball is really a thing,’” Nortman says, recalling a “lot of skepticism around it.” Then came Caitlin Clark’s meteoric rise, the WNBA’s record-breaking viewership, and suddenly basketball became the hottest sector in women’s sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That growing interest validates Nortman’s thesis that women’s sports investment isn’t about finding the single perfect team but about supporting an ecosystem where multiple franchises can thrive. Some will win championships. Some will struggle competitively but succeed commercially. The key is having enough capital and operational expertise distributed across the market to weather individual setbacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Already, Angel City appears to be inspiring other ownership groups. “You started having other teams – Kansas City, Bay FC, Washington D.C. Spirit – with female-led ownership groups come in and show they could build a real P&amp;L,” Nortman notes. Whether intentionally or not, Angel City became a template.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As women’s sports enters what feels like a sustained boom period — the Golden State Valkyries just played their first WNBA next season, the NWSL is expanding, media rights deals are growing — Nortman remains cautiously optimistic about whether this moment will prove different from past surges in interest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The key, she argues, lies in the fundamentals: strong league governance, owner commitment, infrastructure investment, and building genuine community connections. Media attention creates opportunity; operational excellence makes it sustainable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Every spike is an opportunity to create a consistent experience around it,” Nortman says. “You have to look at all the underlying criteria to see where it’s likely to stick around.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meesho.com/\">Meesho</a>, an Indian e-commerce rival to Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, is set to launch a roughly $606 million IPO marked by token sell-downs from early backers and no sales from big names such as SoftBank and Prosus, signalling investor conviction in India’s booming online retail market at a time when tech shareholders globally have been cashing out at listings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/meesho-india-social-commerce-raises-570-million/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last valued at about $5 billion</a> in the private markets in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/flipkart-to-relocate-hq-to-india-ahead-of-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expected to pursue an IPO next year</a> and Amazon <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2025/03/amazon-india-unit-listing-ipo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly exploring a potential spin-off</a> of its India operations, potentially for a future listing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the <a href=\"https://investor.meesho.com/investor-web/_next/docs/ipo/meesho_limited_RHP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prospectus</a> (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2015, Meesho began as a social commerce platform that targeted first-time online shoppers through WhatsApp before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/meesho-claims-indian-e-commerce-first-with-positive-cash-flow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">evolving into a full-fledged marketplace</a>. It has since carved out a fast-growing niche with a low-cost model tailored to India’s price-sensitive consumers and small merchants — an approach that has increasingly pressured larger rivals Amazon and Flipkart. The Bengaluru-based company uses a commission-light model, earning primarily from logistics fees, advertising, and other services, while charging commissions on products sold through its separate Meesho Mall channel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meesho reported revenue from operations of ₹55.78 billion (about $624.0 million) for the six months ended September 30, up from ₹43.11 billion (around $482.0 million) a year earlier, per its prospectus. Net merchandise value rose 44% year-over-year to ₹191.94 billion (roughly $2.15 billion). However, its losses widened, with Meesho posting a restated loss before tax of ₹4.33 billion (around $48.4 million) for the September 2025 half-year, compared with ₹0.24 billion (about $2.7 million) a year earlier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last 12 months, Meesho recorded 234.20 million transacting users — unique consumers who purchased at least one product on the platform. Over the same period, the company had 706,471 annual transacting sellers, defined as sellers who received at least one order in the year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meesho also uses a sprawling creator network for product discovery, with more than 50,000 active content creators generating at least one placed order through their content over the past year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many Indians are only experiencing e-commerce for the first time on Meesho, and much like the rest of us, over the next decade, they will buy more and more things and more and more frequently on this platform,” Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director at Peak XV Partners, told TechCrunch. “That’s why long-term conviction is the reason to hold on to as much of our stake as we can hold on to.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV — which first invested in Meesho in 2018 during its Sequoia Capital India era and holds about 13% across its two vehicles — is selling around 17.38 million shares in the IPO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meesho has positioned itself as a value-focused platform — unlike Amazon and Flipkart, which it sees as convenience-led players. In that respect, the company compares itself with other value-driven marketplaces such as Pinduoduo in China, Shopee in Southeast Asia, and Mercado Libre in Latin America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you look at the value-focused bucket, here, you are trying to appeal to mass market consumers selling all kinds of products and categories in a marketplace business model, which tends to be asset light,” Aatrey told reporters during Meesho’s press conference on Friday. “And the reason people come back is because they want access to more and more selection with the affordability value proposition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meesho also sees the IPO improving its ability to attract talent and strengthening confidence across its wider ecosystem, CFO Dhiresh Bansal told TechCrunch. He said a public listing boosts the company’s brand with job candidates — including those coming from big tech firms — and has a positive knock-on effect on consumers, sellers and logistics partners by reinforcing Meesho’s governance standards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The IPO will open for public subscription on December 3, with the anchor book scheduled for December 2. About 75% of the offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 10% for retail investors and 15% for non-institutional investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SoftBank did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
