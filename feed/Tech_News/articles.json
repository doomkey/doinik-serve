The company said on Friday that users between 18 and 24 years of age accounted for nearly 50% of messages sent to ChatGPT in the country, and users under 30 accounted for 80%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI lab said Indians use ChatGPT mostly for work, with 35% of all messages relating to professional tasks, compared to 30% globally. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In particular, the company’s coding assistant, Codex, is seeing strong traction: OpenAI said Indians use Codex three times more than the global median, and weekly usage has increased by four times since the tool <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/openai-launches-new-macos-app-for-agentic-coding/\">got a Mac app</a> two weeks ago. Users in India are also asking three times as many coding-related questions as the median.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is in line with findings from Antropic, which earlier this week said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/india-brief-economic-index\">45.2% of Claude’s tasks map to software-related use cases</a> in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said outside of work tasks, 35% of messages to ChatGPT from Indians requested guidance, 20% concerned questions about general information, and 20% were requests for the bot to produce or help with writing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is OpenAI’s second-largest market with more than 100 million weekly users, and the company has been actively trying to court Indians for its AI tools and services. The company offers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\">a sub-$5 subscription tier</a> in the country, and last year even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/\">ran promotional campaigns</a> to spur adoption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI adoption is moving faster than our ability to measure it – and that’s a challenge for anyone trying to make smart decisions. Signals is our way of putting real-world evidence on the table, so India’s AI debate can be grounded in facts, not hype,” OpenAI’s chief economist Ronnie Chatterji said in a statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has had a busy few days in India, which is hosting a major <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\">AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi this week.

As the startup behind ChatGPT, OpenAI is arguably the biggest AI player in town. The company is reportedly now in talks to finalize a $100 billion deal, valuing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/openai-reportedly-finalizing-100b-deal-at-more-than-850b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">company at more than $850 billion. </a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many employees have come and gone since the company first launched a decade ago, and some have launched startups of their own. Among these, some have become top rivals (like Anthropic), while others, just on investor interest alone, have managed to raise billions without even launching a product (see, Thinking Machine Labs).  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, Aliisa Rosenthal, OpenAI’s first sales leader, spoke a little bit about this growing network. She, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openais-former-sales-leader-joins-vc-firm-acrew-openai-taught-her-where-startups-can-build-a-moat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">like the other OpenAI alums</a> who did not become founders, decided to become an investor and said she was going to tap into the ex-OpenAI founder network to look for deal flow. We know Peter Deng, OpenAI’s former head of consumer products (and now general partner at Felicis) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/top-openai-google-brain-researchers-set-off-a-300m-vc-frenzy-for-their-startup-periodic-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">already has</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below is a roundup of the major startups founded by OpenAI alumni, in alphabetical order. And we are certain this list will grow over time. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-david-luan-adept-ai-labs-nbsp\">David Luan — Adept AI Labs </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Luan was OpenAI’s engineering VP until he left in 2020. After a stint at Google, in 2021 he co-founded Adept AI Labs, a startup that builds AI tools for employees. The startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/adept-a-startup-training-ai-to-use-existing-software-and-apis-raises-350m/\">last raised $350 million at a valuation north</a> of $1 billion in 2023, but Luan <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/amazon-forms-a-new-ai-agent-focused-lab-led-by-adept-co-founder/\">left in late 2024 to oversee Amazon’s AI agents lab</a> after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/28/amazon-hires-founders-away-from-ai-startup-adept/\">Amazon hired Adept’s founders</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dario-amodei-daniela-amodei-and-john-schulman-anthropic\">Dario Amodei, Daniela Amodei, and John Schulman — Anthropic</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in 2021 to form their own startup, San Francisco-based Anthropic, that has long <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety\">touted</a> a focus on AI safety. OpenAI co-founder John Schulman <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/openai-co-founder-leaves-for-anthropic/\">joined Anthropic in 2024</a>, pledging to build a “safe AGI.” The company has since become OpenAI’s biggest rival and just raised<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/anthropic-raises-another-30-billion-in-series-g-with-a-new-value-of-380-billion/\"> a $30 billion Series G, nabbing a $380 billion valuation </a>in the process. IPO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/anthropic-hires-lawyers-as-it-preps-for-ipo/\">rumors are also swirling,</a> as the company reportedly prepares for a public listing that could come sometime this year. (OpenAI is also allegedly preparing for an IPO this year and is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcK4tjQfJcHT8-jY0F3nGOOVnQsYRVGVQ3r3TaNwsa2_-6J81EL7ORXIELF-AI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699752c0&amp;gaa_sig=FGzuT_Nrf_HWZFINl4wiT-fLI0s5m0b1kq7yAf0off-lEY40Yk7K8RlG4N9aCteO0bEdLFXxt70KeOBMht0S_A%3D%3D\">maybe even trying to beat Anthropic </a>to the public market.) <br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rhythm-garg-linden-li-and-yash-patil-applied-compute\">Rhythm Garg, Linden Li, and Yash Patil — <strong>Applied Compute </strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three ex-OpenAI staffers (Rhythm Garg, Linden Li, and Yash Patil) have reportedly raised $20 million for a startup called Applied Compute, as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.upstartsmedia.com/p/ex-openai-applied-compute-raises-20m\">reported by Upstart Media. </a>All three of them worked as technical staff at OpenAI for more than a year before leaving last May to launch the startup, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhythm-garg/\">per their LinkedIns</a>. The startup helps enterprises train and deploy custom AI agents.

In 2024, Amazon hired all three of the Covariant founders and about a quarter of its staff. The quasi-acquisition was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/18/amazon-antitrust-ai-whistleblower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">viewed by some</a> as part of a broader trend of Big Tech attempting to avoid antitrust scrutiny. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tim-shi-cresta-nbsp\">Tim Shi — Cresta </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tim Shi was an early member of OpenAI’s team, where he focused on building safe artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked at OpenAI for a year in 2017 but left to found Cresta, a San Francisco-based AI contact center startup that has raised over $270 million from VCs like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and others, according to a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cresta-closes-125m-series-d-to-accelerate-adoption-of-human-centric-ai-in-the-contact-center-302309858.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-jonas-schneider-daedalus\">Jonas Schneider — Daedalus</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jonas Schneider led OpenAI’s software engineering for robotics team but left in 2019 to co-found Daedalus, which builds advanced factories for precision components. The San Francisco-based startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/08/daedalus-manufacturing-jonas-schneider-openai-robotics-raises-21-million/\">raised a $21 million Series A last year</a> with backing from Khosla Ventures, among others.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-andrej-karpathy-eureka-labs\">Andrej Karpathy — Eureka Labs</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Computer vision expert Andrej Karpathy was a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI, leaving <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/tesla-hires-deep-learning-expert-andrej-karpathy-to-lead-autopilot-vision/\">the startup to join Tesla in 2017</a> to lead its autopilot program. Karpathy is also well-known for his YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/andrejkarpathy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">videos</a> explaining core AI concepts. He left Tesla in 2024 to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/after-tesla-and-openai-andrej-karpathys-startup-aims-to-apply-ai-assistants-to-education/\">found his own education technology startup</a>, Eureka Labs, a San Francisco-based startup that is building AI teaching assistants.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-margaret-jennings-kindo\">Margaret Jennings — Kindo</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Margaret Jennings worked at OpenAI in 2022 and 2023 until she left to co-found Kindo, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/kindo-aims-to-take-the-security-stress-out-of-ai-workflows/\">markets itself as an AI chatbot for enterprises.</a> Kindo has raised over $27 million in funding, last <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/kindo-raises-20-6m-to-bring-security-to-enterprise-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raising</a> a $20.6 million Series A in 2024.

Living Carbon raised a $21 million Series A round in 2023, bringing its total funding until then to $36 million, according to a <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/01/17/2590194/0/en/Living-Carbon-raises-new-funding-to-plant-4M-fast-growing-carbon-guzzling-supertrees-in-US.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-liam-fedus-periodic-labs\">Liam Fedus — <strong>Periodic Labs </strong> </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liam Fedus, OpenAI’s VP of post-training research, left the company in March 2025 to team up with his former Google Brain colleague, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/top-openai-google-brain-researchers-set-off-a-300m-vc-frenzy-for-their-startup-periodic-labs/\">launch Periodic Labs. </a>The startup seeks to use AI scientists to find new materials, particularly new superconducting materials. It came out of stealth mode in September 2025,<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/former-openai-and-deepmind-researchers-raise-whopping-300m-seed-to-automate-science/\"> armed with a massive $300 million</a> in seed-round funding with backers that included Jezz Bezos, Eric Schmidt, Felicis and Andreessen Horowitz. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-aravind-srinivas-perplexity\">Aravind Srinivas — Perplexity</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aravind Srinivas worked as a research scientist at OpenAI for a year until 2022, when he left the company to co-found AI search engine Perplexity. His startup has attracted a string of high-profile investors like Jeff Bezos and Nvidia, although it’s also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/news-outlets-are-accusing-perplexity-of-plagiarism-and-unethical-web-scraping/\">caused controversy</a> over alleged unethical web scraping. Perplexity, which is based in San Francisco, last reported a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/perplexity-reportedly-raised-200m-at-20b-valuation/\">raise of $200 million at a $20 billion valuation.</a> </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-jeff-arnold-pilot\">Jeff Arnold — Pilot</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jeff Arnold worked as OpenAI’s head of operations for five months in 2016 before co-founding San Francisco-based accounting startup Pilot in 2017. Pilot, which focused initially on doing accounting for startups, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/how-pilot-charted-a-course-of-not-raising-too-much-money/\">last raised a $100 million Series C in 2021 at a $1.2 billion valuation</a> and has attracted investors like Jeff Bezos. Arnold worked as Pilot’s COO until <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-ai-founders-are-starting-their-own-venture-funds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">leaving</a> in 2024 to launch a VC fund.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-shariq-hashme-prosper-robotics\">Shariq Hashme — Prosper Robotics</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shariq Hashme worked for OpenAI for 9 months in 2017 on a bot that could play the popular video game Dota, per his LinkedIn profile. After a few years at data-labeling startup Scale AI, he co-founded London-based Prosper Robotics in 2021. The startup says it’s working on a robot butler for people’s homes, a hot trend in robotics that other players <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/1x-will-test-humanoid-robots-in-a-few-hundred-homes-in-2025/\">like Norway’s 1X</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/apptronik-raises-350m-to-build-humanoid-robots-with-help-from-google/\">Texas-based Apptronik</a> are also working on.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ilya-sutskever-safe-superintelligence-nbsp\">Ilya Sutskever — Safe Superintelligence </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/ilya-sutskever-openai-co-founder-and-longtime-chief-scientist-departs/\">left OpenAI in May 2024</a> after he was reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/a-timeline-of-sam-altmans-firing-from-openai-and-the-fallout/\">part of a failed effort</a> to replace <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/sam-altman-firing-drama-detailed-in-new-book-excerpt/\">CEO Sam Altman</a>. Shortly afterward, he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/19/ilya-sutskever-openais-former-chief-scientist-launches-new-ai-company/\">co-founded Safe Superintelligence, or SSI</a>, with “one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,” he says. Details about what exactly the startup is up to are scant: It has no product and no revenue yet. But investors are clamoring for a piece anyway, and it’s been able to raise $2 billion, with its latest valuation reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/\">rising to $32 billion</a> this month. SSI is based in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-emmett-shear-stem-ai\">Emmett Shear — Stem AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emmett Shear is the former CEO of Twitch who was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/20/openai-emmett-shear-ceo/\">OpenAI’s interim CEO in November 2023 </a>for a few days before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/sam-altmans-officially-back-at-openai-and-the-board-gains-a-microsoft-observer/\">Sam Altman rejoined the company</a>. Shear launched an AI company, StemAI, in 2024 (though it seems to have since rebranded as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://softmax.com/\">Softmax</a>). The company, which appears to be a research company, has attracted funding from Andreessen Horowitz.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mira-murati-thinking-machines-lab-nbsp\">Mira Murati — Thinking Machines Lab </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mira Murati, OpenAI’s CTO, left OpenAI to found her own company, Thinking Machines Lab, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/thinking-machines-lab-is-ex-openai-cto-mira-muratis-new-startup/\">emerged from stealth</a> in February 2025. It said at the time (rather vaguely) that it will build AI that’s more “customizable” and “capable.” The San Francisco AI startup, now valued at $12 billion, announced its first product late last year: an API that fine-tunes language models. It recently made headlines when two of its co-founders announced earlier this year that they<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/mira-muratis-startup-thinking-machines-lab-is-losing-two-of-its-co-founders-to-openai/\"> would return to OpenAI. </a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-kyle-kosic-xai\">Kyle Kosic — xAI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kyle Kosic left OpenAI in 2023 to become a co-founder and infrastructure lead of xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup that offers a rival chatbot, Grok. In 2024, however, he <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/xai-original-employee-departure-kyle-kosic-engineer/\">hopped back</a> to OpenAI, where he remains. Meanwhile, xAI (which acquired Musk’s social media site X) was purchased by<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\"> Musk’s SpaceX</a>, giving the coalesce company a valuation of $1.25 trillion. It is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/with-co-founders-leaving-and-an-ipo-looming-elon-musk-turns-talk-to-the-moon/\">looking to go public sometime in June</a> for what could be a historic listing. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-angela-jiang-worktrace-ai\">Angela Jiang — Worktrace AI </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Angela Jiang left OpenAI in 2024, after working as a product manager and on the public policy team. In April 2025, she <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/former-openai-product-manager-launches-worktrace-ai-mira-murati-backing-2025-10\">quietly launched Worktrace</a>, which uses AI to help enterprises <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://worktrace.ai/\">make business operations more efficient.</a> It observes employee work patterns and automates workflow, according to the company’s website. The business is backed by Mura Murati, OpenAI’s former CTO, who went on to launch Thinking Labs. It is also backed by OpenAI’s startup fund, in addition to a slew of other OpenAI names, like its chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-stealth-startups\">Stealth Startups </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to these startups, a number of other former OpenAI employees have founded startups that are still in stealth mode, according to various updates TechCrunch found on LinkedIn. For instance, it seems that former OpenAI researcher Danilo Hellermark has been working on a generative AI stealth startup for the past few years. He officially left OpenAI at the beginning of 2023. There’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-negritto-b942b8163/\">also one apparently in the works from Lucas Negritto,</a> who worked on OpenAI’s technical team and left the company in 2023 after three years. Since then, he’s founded one startup and has been working on another since August 2025, according to his LinkedIn. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The project aims to provide computing resources for AI applications to educational institutions, government entities, and small and medium enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Sovereign AI infrastructure is becoming essential for national competitiveness. This project brings that capability to India at a national scale, enabling local researchers, innovators, and enterprises to become AI-native while maintaining full data sovereignty and security,” Manu Jain, CEO of G42 India, said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abu Dhabi’s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and India’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) are also part of the project. Last year, MBZUAI and G42 released <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.g42.ai/resources/news/g42-releases-nanda-87b-opening-new-frontiers-hindi-english-language-ai\">Nanda 87B</a>, a Hindi-English large language model built on Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B model, that is purported to understand casual speech in Hindi and English.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Deploying this system in India marks a significant step forward in the country’s computational capacity and sovereign AI initiatives. It will accelerate training and inference for large-scale models, enabling researchers and developers to build AI tailored to India’s needs,” said Andy Hock, chief strategy officer at Cerebras.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The India AI Impact Summit this week saw several AI infrastructure initiatives being launched by both Indian giants and international firms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indian <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/adani-pledges-100b-for-ai-data-centers-as-india-seeks-bigger-role-in-global-ai/\">conglomerate Adani pledged $100 billion</a> to build up to 5 gigawatts of data-center capacity in the country by 2035.

Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won’t receive its equity until the company’s next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo’s stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm’s ownership drops to just 0.75%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, Y Combinator <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/deal\">typically takes a fixed 7% </a>of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re offering a deal so great that it’s appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> The lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency’s appeal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders will work for three months at Neo’s offices in San Francisco’s Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bubble.io/blog/the-new-build-02-fuzzy-khosrowshahi/\">Google Sheets</a> and also Partovi’s uncle).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the program’s main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILQ6WkufBs8&amp;t=1732s\">said on stage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/ai-startup-cursor-raises-funds-at-29-3-billion-value-wsj-says\">$56 million</a> from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Neo Residency will also select five to eight students—either as individuals or small teams—who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neo is keeping the program small and elite: it will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/coding-assistant-cursor-raises-2-3b-5-months-after-its-previous-round/\">$30 billion</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The push is intended to help the AI chipmaker cultivate relationships with future customers in one of the world’s fastest-growing developer markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest move comes through a partnership with early-stage venture firm <a href=\"https://www.activatevc.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Activate</a>, which plans to back about 25 to 30 AI startups from its $75 million debut fund while giving portfolio companies preferential access to Nvidia’s technical expertise. The collaboration follows other India-focused efforts unveiled this week, including work with nonprofit AI Grants India to support early-stage founders and new ties with venture firms focused on the South Asian nation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flurry of activity comes as India hosts its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi, drawing top technology companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was slated to attend but skipped the event due to what the company called unforeseen circumstances. A senior delegation led by executive vice president Jay Puri attended in his place, meeting AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners on the ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing pools of AI developers and startups, making it an increasingly important market for Nvidia as it looks to expand adoption of chips and computing software. By working more closely with founders at the earliest stages, the company is positioning itself to capture long-term demand as new AI-native companies scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aakrit Vaish, founder of Activate, said Nvidia’s engagement with startups in India has historically been relatively light-touch compared with the U.S., but the chipmaker is now looking to work with founders much earlier in their journey. Activate aims to leverage that shift by connecting portfolio startups directly with Nvidia experts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The VC firm, which Vaish describes as focused on “inception investing,” meets technical teams months before company formation and works closely with them as they grow. Its backers include venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas, Peak XV managing director Shailendra Singh, and Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, underlining the prominent network Activate is assembling around its early-stage strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Nvidia, the logic behind partnering with an early-stage venture firm is straightforward: the earlier it builds relationships with promising AI startups, the more likely those companies are to rely on its computing infrastructure as they scale. Vaish told TechCrunch that growing startups typically consume increasing amounts of AI compute over time, making early technical engagement valuable for the chipmaker as a way of generating future business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia already has a sizable presence in the country through its <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Inception program</a>, which supports more than 4,000 startups in India. This week, the chipmaker also <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/india-ai-mission-infrastructure-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded its local ecosystem ties</a>, including partnerships with venture firms such as Accel, Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners to identify and fund AI startups. It separately teamed up with AI Grants India, co-founded by Vaibhav Domkundwar and Bhasker (Bosky) Kode, to support more than 10,000 early-stage founders over the next 12 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also been broadening its startup outreach in India over time. In November 2025, Nvidia <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">joined the India Deep Tech Alliance</a>, a consortium of U.S. and Indian investors including Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, and Celesta Capital, to provide strategic and technical guidance to emerging startups in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vaish said Activate’s partnership with Nvidia is designed to provide a more curated layer on top of the company’s broad-based Inception program, which serves thousands of startups globally. By serving as an early filter for high-potential technical teams, Activate aims to give its portfolio companies more direct, timely access to Nvidia’s engineering expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stepped-up activity underscores intensifying competition among global technology firms to court AI developers and startups in India, which has become one of the fastest-growing pools of technical talent outside the U.S.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Despite the strategic priority that the hardware product represents, the company recently shed one of the top executives tied to the project, reportedly over a dispute with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech blog Sources <a href=\"https://x.com/alexeheath/status/2024340366582038960?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">originally reported</a> that the company had recently lost Scott Myers, its SVP of Specs, over a supposed “blow-up” with Spiegel.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment by TechCrunch, a Snap spokesperson said that Myers had “decided to step down from his role at Snap.” The statement thanked him for his contributions, and wished him “the best in his next chapter.” The spokesperson also disputed the “blow-up” characterization but wouldn’t reveal more about Myers’ departure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spokesperson added: “We can’t wait to bring Specs to the world later this year. We remain focused on disciplined execution and long-term value creation for our developer partners, community and shareholders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear when exactly Myers left the company, or what the alleged “blow-up” might have entailed. When a user on X asked Sources author Alex Heath about the nature of the reported dispute, he replied that it was about “<a href=\"https://x.com/alexeheath/status/2024344234636304493?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">strategy</a>,” adding that he couldn’t reveal more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap has teased the commercial release of Specs for quite a while and, in recent months, has signaled that it’s getting serious about the product’s launch. In January, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">spun off the Specs team</a> into its own distinct subsidiary, Specs Inc., saying that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Myers joined the Snap team in 2020 and, prior to that, held roles at SpaceX, Apple, and Nokia, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-myers-7a63b22/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">his LinkedIn</a> profile. In <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/exclusive-i-asked-snaps-hardware-chief-about-the-companys-next-gen-specs-heres-what-i-found-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an interview</a> with Tom’s Guide last summer, Myers called the development process for Specs an “entirely new paradigm” but also discussed the tricky nature of getting its form factor just right. “I don’t want to see people wearing a wire coming out of the back of their head,” he quipped.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s unclear why Cellebrite has changed its approach, which appears contrary to its previous actions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, researchers at The University of Toronto’s The Citizen Lab <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/research/cellebrite-used-on-kenyan-activist-and-politician-boniface-mwangi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published a report</a> alleging the Kenyan government used Cellebrite’s tools to unlock the phone of Boniface Mwangi, a local activist and politician, while he was in police custody. <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/research/from-protest-to-peril-cellebrite-used-against-jordanian-civil-society/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In another report</a> from January, The Citizen Lab accused the Jordanian government of breaking into the phones of several local activists and protesters using Cellebrite’s tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In both investigations, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/citizen-lab-director-warns-cyber-industry-about-us-authoritarian-descent/\">the Citizen Lab</a>, an organization that has investigated abuses of spyware and hacking technologies around the world, based their conclusions on finding traces of a specific application linked to Cellebrite on the victims’ phones. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researchers said that those traces are a “high confidence” signal that someone used Cellebrite’s unlocking tools on the phones in question, because the same application had been previously found on VirusTotal, a malware repository, and was signed with digital certificates owned by Cellebrite.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other researchers have also <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259893601_Android_Anti-forensics_Modifying_CyanogenMod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">linked the same application</a> to Cellebrite.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do not respond to speculation and encourage any organization with specific, evidence-based concerns to share them with us directly so we can act on them,” Victor Cooper, a spokesperson for Cellebrite, told TechCrunch in an email. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why Cellebrite is acting differently from the Serbia case, Cooper said “the two situations are incomparable,” and that, “high confidence is not direct evidence.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cooper did not respond to multiple follow-up emails asking if Cellebrite would investigate The Citizen Lab’s latest report, and what, if any, differences there are with its case in Serbia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Cellebrite, or other similar companies?

The company has also integrated its latest generative AI models into the app review process, which has helped human reviewers find more complex malicious patterns faster. Google said it plans to increase its AI investments in 2026 to stay ahead of emerging threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Google said it prevented more than 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data, a figure that’s down from <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2025/01/how-we-kept-google-play-android-app-ecosystem-safe-2024.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1.3 million in 2024</a>. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings and reviews last year, and prevented an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_bomb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">review bombing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Android’s defense system, known as Google Play Protect, identified more than 27 million new malicious apps, and warned users or blocked the app from running. That’s an increase from the 13 million non-Play Store apps identified in 2024 and five million seen in 2023. These increases seem to suggest that bad actors are now more often avoiding the Play Store when targeting users with their malicious apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, it is the fastest-growing unit within the battery recycling and materials startup — a reflection of an AI data center building boom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The evidence of that growth, the company says, can be found at its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/redwood-materials-preps-for-expansion-spree-with-new-rd-center-in-san-francisco/\">R&amp;D lab</a> in San Francisco, which has expanded four-fold into a 55,000-square-foot facility and now employs nearly 100 people. Those are small figures compared to Redwood’s total workforce of 1,200 people and its sprawling campus at its Carson City, Nevada headquarters and another facility near Reno. But its value and recent expansion are tied directly to its burgeoning energy storage that launched in June 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco facility, which opened in April 2025, is where engineers integrate the hardware, software, and power electronics for energy storage systems that power data centers, AI computing, and other large-scale industrial applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/news/redwood-quadruples-san-francisco-r-d-footprint-to-support-redwood-energy-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a blog post </a>Thursday the expansion will support a wave of energy storage deployments related to data centers. The company’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/redwood-attracts-google-for-its-425m-series-e-as-ai-power-needs-rise/\">$425 million Series E</a> raise will provide the capital needed to scale the business. Google, a new investor, as well as existing backer Nvidia, joined the round to support Redwood’s energy storage business venture.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI data centers have definitely been a pressing area of focus,” Claire McConnell, vice president of business development told TechCrunch in a recent interview, who added there are other use cases for its systems including supporting renewable projects like solar and wind. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers have been around for decades, but advancements in AI have spurred a building spree and a need for reliable electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What data center developers are seeing is something that they hadn’t experienced before,” McConnell said. “When they’re trying to connect to the grid, they are being told it is going to take five-plus years to get that and at the same time, you’re seeing this massive demand to build more data centers and compete in the AI race.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Redwood Materials was founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics, which was processed and then sold to customers such as Panasonic. The company also expanded into the battery materials business and today produces cathodes for battery cells. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company opened <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/redwood-materials-launches-energy-storage-business-and-its-first-target-is-ai-data-centers/\">Redwood Energy</a> last summer to leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Redwood Energy’s first customer is Crusoe, a startup that, in 2021, Straubel invested in. Redwood set up an energy storage system that uses old EV batteries that are not yet ready for recycling. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas — the initial site of the Stargate project. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McConnell said customers that are in the pipeline include hyperscalers — companies that operate massive cloud computing data centers and consume hundreds of megawatts of power — that would far exceed the capacity of its project with Crusoe.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re working on ones in the hundreds of megawatt hours, and we have ones in the pipeline that are multiple gigawatt hours,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Studies suggest that roles where <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-us-labor-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI can automate most tasks will be impacted</a>, though some <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-will-ai-affect-the-global-workforce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">analysts</a> <a href=\"https://time.com/7357476/economics-of-ai-and-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">believe</a> that AI may also create jobs, with the displacement effect only transitional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Shim, CEO of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/read-ai-raises-50m-to-integrate-its-bot-with-slack-email-and-more/\">meeting notetaker and intelligence company Read AI</a>, told TechCrunch at Web Summit Qatar earlier this month that even with the rise of AI tools, it will ultimately be humans who decide the course of action, and their job will be important. He equated the technology with using maps in a car.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there’s always going to be a human in the middle,” Shim said. “I think the job is going to get easier over time. But a good example would be like driving a car. When we first started, you used to have a map. And you’d pull out the map. And you’d go in and say okay I’m driving. I’m deciding what happens. Now everyone uses Waze or Google Maps, and the map is telling you where to go. And you’re just following that order. But you’re the human in the middle who can decide what happens.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shim acknowledged that AI would affect jobs, noting that advertising agencies may lose human roles in favor of automated tools. However, he noted that tech platforms would need jobs to oversee the automation process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abdullah Asiri, founder of AI-powered consumer support tooling startup <a href=\"https://www.lucidya.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lucidya</a>, said that he believes that AI will replace tasks but not roles. He said that when his company’s clients use Lucidya, customer support agents often take up different roles and responsibilities. He noted that some become supervisors who guide other humans and AI, while some take up relationship-building and business development responsibilities using the time they saved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Read AI’s Shim noted that meeting notetakers have freed up humans from taking notes manually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody here wants to sit down and take meeting notes, but as you start to take away that job, you have a little bit more time to do other things that you can go and focus on. You can send that report a little bit faster, or you can respond back to a customer and actually have better context to make better decisions, versus spending a bunch of time gathering all the information and having little time to make a decision,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-s-internal-use-and-hiring\">AI’s internal use and hiring</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As tech companies like Read AI and Lucidya are increasingly using AI tools, they want to keep their teams lean. Currently, Read AI’s customer service team consists of just five people, who serve millions of monthly users. Shim noted that the company is using AI tools to make a small team more productive and give them more context to help them do their job more quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies are said to be reaping productivity gains. Read AI said that its sales tool helps predict the state of a deal using data from CRM systems like HubSpot and Salesforce. The startup said that it has seen deals worth $200 million approved through that system. Shim said Read AI captures 23% more context with each update, which could be used to evaluate what worked or what didn’t in a lead call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucidya’s Asiri also noted that the company uses AI tools, including Read AI, for meetings and marketing asset creation. He said that the company wants “scale outcomes without scaling headcounts.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The goal for any company is to hire people who are AI native, who are very strong with AI, but we need to be realistic,” Asiri said. “Today, this skill is being developed. You cannot find a lot of people who have very strong AI capabilities, not building AI, but using AI.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091418\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=768,544 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=680,482 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=430,305 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=720,510 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=668,473 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=529,375 529w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=708,502 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/55077689773_5c9508802a_c.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Lucidya CEO Abdullah Asiri</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ramsey Cardy/Web Summit Qatar via Sportsfile</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asiri noted that people who would be able to build agents that can help them do their job would be more desirable to hire.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-handling-customer-perception-of-ai\">Handling customer perception of AI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shim noted that just a few years ago, many people were hesitant to have AI notetakers in meetings and didn’t understand why a bot was on the call. However, now people are more receptive to notetakers as long as you give them controls around recording, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asiri said that Lucidya discloses to users when it’s using a voice AI to communicate. He said that for users, issue resolution is more important than the fact that an AI bot is handling their calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s all about resolving issues and finding customers’ problems and resolving them,” Asiri said. “As long as the AI agents are actually focusing on that part, customers are happy that their issues are being resolved. The customer really doesn’t care whether it’s fixed by AI or a human, as long as it’s fixed fast and accurately.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature offers suggested questions based on the video, or users can use their remote’s microphone button to ask anything related to the video. For instance, they might ask about recipe ingredients or the background of a song’s lyrics, and receive instant answers without pausing or leaving the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, this feature is available to a select group of users over 18 and supports English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube first launched this <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/youtube-to-test-generative-ai-features-including-a-comments-summarizer-and-conversational-tool/\">conversational AI tool</a> in 2024 to help viewers explore content in greater depth. The expansion to TVs comes as more Americans now access YouTube through their television than ever before. A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">Nielsen report</a> from April 2025 found that YouTube accounted for 12.4% of total television audience time, surpassing major platforms like Disney and Netflix.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies are also making significant strides with their conversational AI technologies.

Digit is intended to work in industrial environments without humans nearby, often bridging two automated production lines. In this case, the robots will be unloading totes full of auto parts from an automated warehouse tugger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While seven robots doing manual drudgery may seem a small step compared to sizzle reels of metal humans doing backflips, actually deploying humanoid robots in real workplaces is rare and difficult. Demonstrating a capability in a lab is one thing, but integrating it into a company’s workflow — including maintenance and charging — isn’t easy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When the tech companies spend real time in the field understanding the task that needs to be operated, the real workflows that happens…that’s when we will see a huge uptick in adoption,” Ram Devarajulu, a VP at Cambridge Consultants, said at the Humanoids Summit in late 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agility is among the leaders in getting robots out of the lab, with Digits working in similar capacities for logistics providers like GXO, Schaeffler, and Amazon. The company has a proprietary cloud-based software package called Arc for users to manage fleets of their robots, and says AI will be vital in reducing deployment costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Cost of deployment … can be more than the price of the robot by a lot,” Pras Velagapudi, Agility’s CTO, said in an interview last year. “AI tools let us decrease that cost of deployment, decrease the amount of time getting the robot configured and getting it operating at a level of performance that they want.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMMC and Agility will use this engagement as an opportunity to pioneer other use cases that relieve human workers of repetitive physical tasks and prioritize more valuable work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also preparing a next-generation robot that will be safe to operate alongside human workers; current humanoid robots that are strong enough to lift heavy loads are still considered too unreliable to operate autonomously around people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Competitor Figure AI <a href=\"https://www.figure.ai/news/production-at-bmw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tested</a> its Figure 02 robots in a BMW factory for 10 months last year, which the company said unloaded 90,000 parts.

Now it wants its own court, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase’s city administrator submitted a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2.18.2026-Packet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proposed ordinance</a> to the city commission during a meeting on Wednesday that would create a municipal court with a part-time judge, prosecutor, and court clerk. Starbase’s mayor will serve as the judge until one is appointed to a two-year term. The administrator wrote that he hopes to have a candidate ready by next month’s meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The formation of a court within Starbase, which currently claims around 580 residents and sits adjacent to SpaceX’s South Texas rocket factory and launch facility, is the latest in a series of steps the city has taken to build up its own municipal services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the volunteer fire department, Starbase is also now handling its own building permits and fire code inspections. And when a plan to contract local county sheriff’s deputies to patrol the city fell apart, the city <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/elon-musks-spacex-company-town-is-getting-a-police-department/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decided instead to start up the Starbase Police Department</a>. (The city is still paying the Cameron County Sheriff’s Department to use its jail facilities, though, according to paperwork filed ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starbase is still in the process of establishing the police department, and it expects that process could take around six months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During Wednesday’s meeting, the city commission reviewed an application to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement that is required to stand up the police force. That application revealed some new details about the plans for the new Starbase Police Department.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The city wrote that its expanding population has led to an increase in calls for service. Across 2025, there were 420 calls to law enforcement in the city, 180 calls for fire service, and 140 EMS calls, according to the application. There were also 353 crashes documented in the area last year, with more than 7,000 vehicles traveling Highway 4 — the main artery in and out of Starbase — per day. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Cameron County Sheriff’s Office has not been able to “guarantee dedicated law enforcement coverage for Starbase,” the city wrote, and Starbase’s remote geographic location “requires rapid and reliable” response times. “These limitations have raised significant concerns among residents and city leadership,” the city wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The city’s unique blend of cutting-edge technology and coastal charm, coupled with high median household incomes and rising property values, drives expectations for municipal services, particularly public safety,” the city wrote in the application. The city was also sure to point out that SpaceX launches, which are expected to dramatically increase over the next few years, draw many tourists to the area. “Additionally, The City has a substantial governmental interest in ensuring the integrity of spaceflight operations occurring within its jurisdiction,” the application reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company on Thursday announced the official launch of a trio of options, including Split View, PDF annotations, and a Save to Google Drive feature, designed to more deeply integrate Chrome with one of Google’s other online services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While these particular additions aren’t focused on AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/google-brings-gemini-in-chrome-to-us-users-unveils-agentic-browsing-capabilities-and-more/\">Google already integrated its Gemini AI assistant into Chrome</a>. The move was made in response to the increased competition from AI providers like OpenAI and Perplexity, which are dabbling in agentic browsers. These so-called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/as-the-browser-wars-heat-up-here-are-the-hottest-alternatives-to-chrome-and-safari-in-2025/\">browser wars</a> have pushed Google to be less stagnant in terms of developing and releasing more consumer-facing features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Split View, multitasking in Chrome has become easier as the feature puts two pages side-by-side in the same tab. This lets you work across two web pages or watch a video while taking notes, among other things. To use the feature, you’ll drag a tab to the left or right edge of the browser window or right-click a link and select “Open Link in Split View.” The tabs will automatically snap into place. When no longer needed, you can exit the Split View layout via an option found via a right-click.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094518\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=430,278 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=720,466 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=900,582 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=800,518 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=668,432 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=580,375 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=954,617 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=708,458 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another practical addition is the PDF annotations feature, which lets you add notes to a PDF or highlight its text from the browser. This means you don’t have to download the PDF and then open it in another application to work with its content. The option, a long time coming, could make it much simpler to do basic PDF tasks, like digitally signing a document, filling out a form, making notes within a file or personal document, and more. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094513\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg 1380w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=1200,774 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=1280,826 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=430,277 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=720,464 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=900,580 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=800,516 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=668,431 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=581,375 581w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=957,617 957w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=708,457 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, the new Save to Google Drive feature will allow you to save any PDF directly to your Google Drive account, instead of your computer, where it may get lost.

The move comes as Reddit launched its <a href=\"https://www.business.reddit.com/blog/dynamic-product-ads-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first shoppable ad product</a> last year, called Dynamic Product Ads (DPA), which display personalized product recommendations to users based on their interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, when users who are part of the test search for something like “best noise-canceling headphones” or “electronic gift ideas for a college student,” they will see a carousel of related products at the bottom of the results. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This carousel will feature products directly mentioned by users from conversations on related posts and comments. If users tap on the product, they can view more details and then be directed to the retailer to purchase the item. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This feature surfaces top-recommended products directly from discussions, giving redditors instant information about any product,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/news/in-case-you-saw-it-we-are-testing-a-new-shopping-product-experience-in-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “This test is designed to make Reddit easier to navigate while keeping community perspectives at the center of the experience. We’ll continue learning from how people use this new feature and refine the experience over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While platforms like TikTok and Instagram have long integrated shopping features, Reddit is now looking to follow suit. Of course, Reddit isn’t the only tech platform that recently started exploring AI-driven shopping, as OpenAI’s ChatGPT rolled out an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">“Instant Checkout”</a> feature last September that lets users make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thursday’s announcement comes after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/\">Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said</a> during the company’s earnings release last week that the platform’s AI search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business, not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huffman also noted that weekly active users for search grew 30% over the past year, increasing from 60 million to 80 million, while weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers feature rose from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
