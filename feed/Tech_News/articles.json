The app is also introducing new AI tools for merchants, and is inviting users to submit photos of their orders if the item doesn’t yet have a menu image.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new “Live order chat” feature, merchants can message customers in real-time to do things like confirm replacements for sold-out items, clarify special requests, and check in on dietary or allergy preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber states that users can’t initiate chats with merchants, as customers can only message merchants if they have contacted them first. Live order chat is available for both delivery and pickup orders, and ends once the food has been handed off to a courier or customer for pickup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch of the new feature comes three months after Uber Eats rival DoorDash <a href=\"https://about.doordash.com/en-us/news/doordash-empowers-merchants-with-new-real-time-features?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced the ability for merchants</a> to chat directly with customers to resolve order issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the new AI tools for merchants, Uber Eats is launching AI-powered summaries of customer reviews to make it easier to understand feedback at scale. Plus, Uber Eats is rolling out AI-generated item descriptions for menus to help users make informed decisions when deciding what to order. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3032499\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AI-enhanced-food-photos.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Uber</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app will also use AI to enhance low-quality food images by improving lighting, resolution, framing, and plating. For example, if there’s a photo of food in a takeout container, Uber Eats might use AI to generate an image of the same dish on a plate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Uber Eats will now encourage users to snap a photo of their delivery. The company says it’s doing this because it’s aware that customers are more likely to order a dish when they are able to see what it looks like. If a customer’s photo is chosen and published, they can get $3 in Uber Cash if they live in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, or the U.K. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To submit a photo, users need to tap the “Add Photos” button on the rate order screen after their order is delivered. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Proton Authenticator is built for anyone who wants a secure, transparent, and convenient way to protect their accounts,” Eamonn Maguire, Head of Account Security at Proton, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe strong security should never come at the cost of your convenience or privacy. That’s why we’ve developed Proton Authenticator: to give users peace of mind that their 2FA codes are available wherever they need them, without relying on Google or Microsoft. We’re putting users firmly in control not only over their data, but the way they access their online accounts,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two-factor authentication using an app provides users with an extra layer of security to prevent attackers from taking over accounts. While SMS-based two-factor authentication is another option, it is often vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks, in which attackers can intercept your calls and messages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Proton is on a product-releasing spree. Earlier this week, the company launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/protons-new-privacy-first-ai-assistant-encrypts-all-chats-keeps-no-logs/\">a privacy-focused AI chatbot named Lumo</a>, which doesn’t keep any conversation records or use user data to train models.<br></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A GitHub spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that this number represents “all-time users.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means five million people have tried out GitHub Copilot for the first time in the last three months; the company reported in April <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thurrott.com/dev/320356/github-copilot-has-over-15-million-users\">the tool had reached 15 million users</a>. Microsoft and GitHub don’t report how many of these 20 million people have continued to use the AI coding tool on a monthly or daily basis — though those metrics are likely far lower.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft also reported GitHub Copilot, which is among the most popular AI coding tools offered today, is used by 90% of the Fortune 100. The product’s growth among enterprise customers has also grown about 75% compared to last quarter, according to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools are rising in popularity, and they seem to be one of the few AI products generating notable revenue. In 2024, Nadella said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2024/earnings-fy-2024-q4\">GitHub Copilot was a larger business</a> than all of GitHub was when Microsoft acquired it in 2018. In the year since, it seems GitHub Copilot’s growth rate has continued in a positive direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The world’s most popular AI coding tools still have tiny user bases compared to AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, which attract hundreds of millions of users every month. Of course, software engineering is more niche than the general informational queries offered by AI chatbots. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, software engineers and their employers seem to be willing to pay a premium for AI coding tools. And with Microsoft’s long list of enterprise customers and GitHub’s ecosystem of developers, GitHub Copilot is well positioned to dominate the market for enterprise AI coding tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cursor, another popular AI coding tool, wants to challenge GitHub Copilot in the enterprise, and it’s been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/cursor-snaps-up-enterprise-startup-koala-in-challenge-to-github-copilot/\">scooping up talent</a> from fledgling AI startups to do so. Cursor reportedly had <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/cursor-an-ai-coding-assistant-draws-a-million-users-without-even-trying\">more than a million people</a> using its product every day in March, according to Bloomberg. At that time, the company generated about $200 million in annualized recurring revenue. Today, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">Cursor’s ARR is more than $500 million</a>, suggesting there are now a lot more people using its products everyday.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While GitHub Copilot and Cursor initially sought to tackle different parts of the developer experience, they’re steadily converging into similar products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both companies have recently introduced <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-copilot-code-review-now-generally-available/\">AI agents to review code</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cursor-releases-new-ai-tool-for-debugging-code/\">catch bugs</a> introduced by humans. Github and Cursor are also both trying to create <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/cursor-launches-a-web-app-to-manage-ai-coding-agents/\">AI agents that automate programmer workflows</a>, allowing developers to offload tasks altogether. Nadella said during Wednesday’s earnings call that GitHub was seeing great momentum with their AI coding agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond Cursor, GitHub has an array of well-capitalized competitors that would like to sell AI coding tools to the enterprise. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s Google — which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\">acquired the leaders of AI coding startup Windsurf</a> — as well as Cognition, the maker of Devin that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/cognition-maker-of-the-ai-coding-agent-devin-acquires-windsurf/\">subsequently acquired the rest of Windsurf’s team</a>.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the next year, Aurora Innovation CEO Chris Urmson wants to “unlock” the Sunbelt of the United States, a southern route where its self-driving trucks will carry goods for companies like Uber Freight and Hirschbach Motor Lines. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora, which launched its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/aurora-launches-commercial-self-driving-truck-service-in-texas/\">driverless commercial self-driving truck service</a> this spring, has already made some progress toward that goal. The company reported Wednesday in its second-quarter letter to shareholders that it now has three self-driving trucks operating commercially between Dallas and Houston, and logged more than 20,000 driverless miles by the end of June. Its commercial self-driving trucks have a human “observer” in the cab, people who are not there to operate or intervene, according to the company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora has also opened a terminal in Phoenix, another physical sign of its Sunbelt trucking-route mission. Aurora is piloting autonomous trucking on a 15-hour route from its terminal in Fort Worth, Texas to Phoenix for customers, Hirschbach and Werner. The company’s terminals, which are located within one to five miles from the highway, require the driverless trucks to handle exits and surface streets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s the company’s ability to operate at night that helps it push into new territory. Aurora said Wednesday it has validated the ability for its driverless trucks to navigate highways and roads at night. This allows the trucks to travel longer distances — and importantly past the federally mandated service limitation for traditional human drivers. Truck drivers are allowed to drive up to 11 hours over a 14-hour period; and they can’t do that day after day. Truck drivers are also required to take 10-hour breaks after completing a long-haul route. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The value is really on longer lengths — so 600 miles is certainly a good range, where that is on the border of what’s possible for people,” Urmson told TechCrunch in a recent interview, adding that ultimately he hopes Aurora trucks are carrying freight from Miami to California. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urmson partially credits Aurora’s proprietary, long-range lidar, which can detect objects in the dark more than 450 meters away, for its ability to operate at night. The lidar can identify pedestrians, vehicles, and debris up to 11-seconds sooner than a traditional driver, according to the company. Aurora has acquired two lidar companies since it was founded in 2017.

Aurora has not completed the validation for that today, and “so we’re not willing to put that check mark next to it and let it go out there,” he noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, the company monitors weather on its one commercial route between Dallas and Houston. If adverse weather conditions like rain suddenly arise, those trucks are able to detect this and pull themselves off the road on their own where they will wait to be rescued, Urmson said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This year is really about building the capability toolbox so that the vehicles can drive where they need to,” he said in a nod to the company’s focus on validating driving at night and in the rain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next year, Aurora will focus on scaling its road network, in terms of distances and its fleet. Aurora plans to have “tens of driverless trucks” operating on public roads by the end of the year and “hundreds” by the end of 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this, from the driverless trucks’ ability to function at night and in rain to opening more routes and a with a larger fleet, will be critical if Aurora ever hopes to reach profitability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revenue-to-net income gap today is a large one.

During Meta’s second-quarter earnings call, the social networking exec told investors he believes people without AI glasses will be at a disadvantage in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI, because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day, hear what you hear, [and] talk to you,” Zuckerberg said during the earnings call. Adding a display to those glasses will then unlock more value, he said, whether that’s a wider, holographic field of view, as with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/meta-developed-a-neural-interface-for-its-next-gen-orion-ar-glasses/\">Meta’s next-gen Orion AR glasses</a>, or a smaller display that might ship in everyday AI eyewear.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI — or some way to interact with AI — I think you’re …  probably [going to] be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people,” Zuckerberg added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has been focused on building smart glasses, like its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/meta-updates-its-smart-glasses-with-real-time-ai-video/\">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> and, more recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/meta-unveils-its-oakley-smart-glasses/\">Oakley Meta glasses</a>. The glasses let users listen to music, take photos or videos, and ask Meta AI questions, including about what they’re seeing, among other things. These wearables have turned into a surprise hit for the company, as revenue from sales of the Ray-Ban Metas <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/28/ray-ban-meta-revenue-tripled-essilorluxottica.html\">more than tripled year-over-year,</a> according to glasses giant EssilorLuxottica. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Zuckerberg believes there’s more to be done with displays. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is … what we’ve been maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years — basically doing the research on all these different things,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Reality Labs division has been a money pit for the company, so it’s not surprising the exec wants to justify its cost to investors by positioning it as a bet on the future of AI and consumer computing in general. For example, Meta said Reality Labs’ <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/250730/p41#a250730p41\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">operating loss was $4.53 billion</a> in the second quarter. Since 2020, the unit has lost <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/metas-reality-labs-second-quarter-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nearly $70 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the future of consumer AI may or may not be in the form of glasses. This spring, OpenAI acquired former Apple executive <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">Jony Ive’s startup in a $6.5 billion deal</a> to build new consumer devices for interacting with AI. Already, other startups have dabbled in this area as well, including in form factors like AI pins — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">such as with Humane’s flop</a> — and pendents, like those from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/a16z-backed-rewind-pivots-to-build-ai-powered-pendant-to-record-your-conversations/\">Limitless</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/friend-delays-shipments-of-its-ai-companion-pendant/\">Friend</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Glasses, for now, seem to make the most sense, as many people already wear them, and they’re more socially acceptable. But the world didn’t know it needed smartphones, either, until someone dreamed them up. The next AI device could be something we can’t even imagine yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Zuckerberg cheers the idea that glasses are going to be it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The other thing that’s awesome about glasses is they are going to be the ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together,” he said. “So the whole Metaverse vision, I think, is going to … end up being extremely important, too, and AI is going to accelerate that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A few months later, he was out of the job.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Markert is one of two former SpaceX employees who have filed separate wrongful-termination lawsuits, both of which were removed to federal court earlier this month. The two complaints make similar allegations about how speed and cost-saving triumphed over other considerations — including safety.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuits arrive as SpaceX races to get its Starship ultra-heavy rocket ready to complete missions for NASA, commercial customers, and to launch the company’s Starlink satellite internet service. Beyond the Starship program, SpaceX also operates the most frequently launched rocket in history, the Falcon 9, which has flown 87 times so far this year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Markert spent 13 years at the company before being terminated in April. He alleges that during his tenure technicians were sometimes required to work 15 to 20 days in a row, but when he brought this up to supervisors, he was told “the schedule comes first.” That punishing schedule, performed in a high-stress environment, resulted in injuries Markert alleges the ship technicians were too afraid to report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Markert suggested the company prioritize trainings and certifications, he was told “there is no time for that and the company would not spend money on it,” according to the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second lawsuit, filed by SpaceX plumber David Lavalle, alleges he was fired after the company failed to accommodate multiple work-related injuries, including a fractured foot, severe neck pain, injuries to his back and shoulders, and wrist pain. While Lavalle filed for workers’ compensation for some of these injuries, he did not do so for all for fear of retaliation, the complaint says.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nine days after requesting medical leave for gout-induced knee pain, Lavalle was terminated. Lavalle, who is 60 years old, joined the company in 2014. He alleges in the complaint he was part of a wave of firings of older staff members, led in part by 28-year-old Scott Hiler, whom SpaceX hired as a new senior manager late last year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A lawyer representing Markert declined comment, while Lavalle’s attorney did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request  for comment. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/spacex-worker-injury-rates-at-starbase-outpace-industry-rivals/\">Recent reporting from TechCrunch</a> showed that SpaceX outpaced its peers in worker injury rates for 2024. Data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration showed that the Starbase complex in Texas recorded an injury rate of 4.27 per 100 workers last year, nearly triple the aerospace manufacturing average of 1.6.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Markert, a resident of Los Angeles County, doesn’t expressly state where he worked at SpaceX. The lawsuit does note he worked with ship technicians. SpaceX’s west coast rocket fairing recovery operations count the highest injury rates of all SpaceX sites, the OSHA logs show, with an injury rate of 7.6 per 100 workers for the west coast operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both complaints were filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and were then removed by SpaceX to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said Wednesday in its second-quarter earnings report that it plans to more than double its spend on building AI infrastructure, like data centers and servers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion…up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the midpoint,” Meta said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s an aggressive capex growth, and one that Meta plans to continue onwards to 2026. The company said it expects a similarly large increase in spend on AI infrastructure next year as the company continues to “aggressively [pursue] opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of [its] artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences, so we expect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that work,” said Susan Li, Meta CFO, during the company’s Wednesday earnings call. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li also noted that while Meta expects to finance most of its AI spend on its own, the company is exploring ways to work with financial partners to co-develop data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure, while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time,” Li said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has announced two major AI “titan clusters.” The first is Prometheus in Ohio, which is poised to be among the first AI superclusters to hit 1 gigawatt of compute power when it comes online in 2026. Then there’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">Hyperion</a>, a cluster in Louisiana that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has bragged would have a footprint the size of Manhattan and could scale up to 5 gigawatts over several years. On top of those, Meta has several other unnamed titan-scale clusters underway. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s data center projects promise to soak up enough energy to power millions of homes, pulling that electricity from nearby communities. One of the company’s projects in Newton County, Georgia, has already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">caused the water taps to run dry in some residents’ homes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta also noted in its earnings report that it expects its second-largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as the company spends millions, and possibly even billions, to poach talented AI engineers and researchers to work for Meta’s newly formed business unit, Superintelligence Labs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before earnings, Zuckerberg shared his vision for “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-meta-likely-wont-open-source-all-of-its-superintelligence-ai-models/\">personal superintelligence</a>,” the idea that AI should help individual people live their best lives, mainly through the medium of Meta’s smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s stock surged 10% in after-hours as investors responded to Meta’s overall performance in the quarter and better-than-expected outlook for the third quarter. Meta reported revenue of $47.5 billion in the second quarter, with expectations to hit between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion in Q3. Advertising drove Meta’s revenue gains, fueled by AI tools — like AI-powered translations and video generation — to help advertisers create more meaningful and targeted campaigns. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s Reality Labs segment, however, saw a $4.5 billion loss. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to reflect Meta’s additional paths to funding its AI infrastructure builds.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/google-is-pausing-its-experiment-of-allowing-real-money-games-on-the-play-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">paused</a> that rollout in June 2024 and stated it would continue to allow apps already included in the 2022 India pilot to remain on the platform.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside offering to expand its Play Store for all real-money games self-declared by developers, Google proposed to update its Developer Program Policies to reflect the update. The company also stated that it would finalize an “appropriate business model” for real-money game developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Google has proposed to allow “games of skill” to be advertised in India where the app maker provides proof by a third party that it is a game of skill and not gambling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recognized third parties in this case could even be industry associations such as the All India Gaming Federation, E-Gaming Federation, or the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said it would begin allowing compliant real-money games on its Play Store in India within 120 days of the CCI’s approval, while related ad policy changes would take effect within 150 days of the regulator’s order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re pleased the CCI is market testing our proposed framework for real-money games (RMGs) in India,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “This development reflects our constructive discussions with the CCI and the Indian developer community along with our commitment to building a more open and safe ecosystem for RMG apps across Google Play and Google Ads.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the proposal, if it is accepted by the CCI after public feedback, would benefit Google, which stands to earn a share of revenue from a broader range of real-money gaming apps and their ads on its platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Real-money gaming dominates India’s online gaming market, accounting for nearly 86% of total industry revenue — ₹274.38 billion ($3 billion) in 2024 — per a <a href=\"https://www.ibef.org/news/india-s-online-gaming-sector-may-cross-rs-77-688-crore-us-9-billion-by-2029-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">joint report</a> by WinZO and the Interactive Entertainment and Innovation Council (IEIC) released earlier this year. However, its share is expected to decline slightly to 80% by 2029, as non-real-money games grow in popularity and the overall market expands to ₹785.51 billion ($8.9 billion).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s latest proposal could also offer a boost to developers currently distributing their apps outside the Play Store — including via APK files on their own websites. However, the CCI’s investigation is still ongoing, and the regulator has yet to determine whether Google engaged in discriminatory practices in this space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The probe adds to a growing list of antitrust challenges for Google in India, where the U.S.-headquartered tech giant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/25/google-hit-with-113-million-fine-in-india-for-anti-competitive-practices-with-play-store-policies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has already been fined</a> for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/15/india-orders-antitrust-probe-into-google-app-store-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">allegedly abusing its dominance</a> through Android and the Play Store. The company recently <a href=\"https://www.medianama.com/2025/07/223-google-play-store-billing-supreme-court-cci/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">approached the Supreme Court</a> to appeal one of these rulings and contest the CCI’s findings. The case is expected to be listed for hearing next month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We look forward to continuing to work with the CCI and the wider RMG ecosystem, and are confident our proposed framework will empower Indian developers, grow the digital economy, and prioritize user safety,” Google’s spokesperson said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

some messaging apps do, Germ integrates with ATProto. This allows Germ users to securely chat with friends from Bluesky and the wider open social web, including apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/flashes-a-photo-sharing-app-for-bluesky-opens-beta/\">Flashes</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/mark-cuban-backs-skylight-a-tiktok-alternative-built-on-blueskys-underlying-technology/\">Skylight</a>, but with added controls over the user experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, you can choose to accept DMs from people you follow on Bluesky, or you could configure it so that only you can initiate chats with other people. Plus, when you block a user in Germ, you can choose to block them only in Germ or block them across Bluesky and other ATProto-powered apps as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concept for Germ comes from co-founders <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tessa-r-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tessa Brown</a> (CEO), a communications scholar who previously taught at Stanford, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmxue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mark Xue</a>, who worked as a privacy engineer at Apple on technologies like FaceTime and iMessage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brown’s studies led her to realize that access to private communications was fundamental to the health of social networks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?w=339\" alt=\"a screenshot of the Germ app, showing its download and onboarding process.\" class=\"wp-image-3032417\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png 885w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=149,300 149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=768,1542 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=339,680 339w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=598,1200 598w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=637,1280 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=214,430 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=359,720 359w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=448,900 448w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=398,800 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=765,1536 765w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=333,668 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=187,375 187w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=307,617 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=264,531 264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/app-clip.png?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Germ</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know that, psychologically, you can’t build a good relationship with people if you feel like you’re being stared at and manipulated all the time. And that’s really what social media is today,” Brown tells TechCrunch. “So I came out of that work with a really strong conviction around end-to-end encrypted messaging as kind of the centerpiece of what I thought was the future of social media and the future of communication,” she adds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xue, meanwhile, came out of Apple believing that the use of phone numbers and telephony is a dated technology to serve as the basis for secure communications and wanted to build something new.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Germ’s service works by way of a “magic link,” which is generated for you and pasted into your Bluesky bio. When another Bluesky user on iOS clicks this link, they can immediately chat with you without downloading a new app from the App Store. To make this possible, Germ takes advantage of underutilized Apple technology called App Clips, which allow users to run a portion of an app’s code on their device without installing the full app.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, App Clips are used for miscellaneous one-off-type transactions, like paying for parking via a QR code.

We’ll need to be rigorous about mitigating these risks and careful about what we choose to open source.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That wording about open source is significant. Zuckerberg has historically positioned Meta’s Llama family of open models as the company’s key differentiator from competitors like OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind. Meta’s goal has been to create open AI models that were as good as or better than those closed models. In a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2024 letter</a>, Zuckerberg wrote, “Starting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg has previously left himself room to maneuver on this commitment. “If at some point however there’s some qualitative change in what the thing is capable of, and we feel like it’s not responsible to open source it, then we won’t,” he said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/mark-zuckerberg?open=false#%C2%A7dangers-of-open-source\">podcast</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while many say Llama doesn’t fit the strict definition of open source AI — partly because Meta hasn’t released its massive training datasets — Zuckerberg’s words point to a possible change in priority: Open source may no longer be the default for Meta’s cutting-edge AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a reason why Meta’s rivals keep their models closed. Closed models give companies more control over monetizing their products. Zuckerberg pointed out last year that Meta’s business isn’t reliant on selling access to AI models, so “releasing Llama doesn’t undercut our revenue, sustainability, or ability to invest in research like it does for closed providers.”  Meta, of course, makes most of its money from selling internet advertising.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, that stated viewpoint on open models was <em>before</em> Meta started to feel like it was falling behind competitors, and executives became <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/meta-execs-obsessed-over-beating-openais-gpt-4-internally-court-filings-reveal/\">obsessed with beating OpenAI’s GPT-4 model</a> while developing Llama 3. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cut to June 2025, when Meta began its public AGI sprint in earnest by investing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/new-details-emerge-on-metas-14-3b-deal-for-scale/\">$14.3 billion in Scale AI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/report-meta-taps-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-to-join-new-superintelligence-lab/\">acquiring Scale’s founder</a> and CEO, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/meta-restructures-its-ai-unit-under-superintelligence-labs/\">restructuring its AI efforts</a> under a new unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs. Meta has spent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/meta-reportedly-hires-four-more-researchers-from-openai/\">billions of dollars</a> to acquire researchers and engineers from top AI firms and build out new data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/meta-built-its-ai-reputation-on-openness-that-may-be-changing/\">Recent reports indicate</a> that all that investment has led Meta to pause testing on its latest Llama model, Behemoth, and instead focus efforts on developing a closed model. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Zuckerberg’s mission for introducing “personal superintelligence” to the world — a decided shift from the rivals he says are working on “automating all valuable work” — his AI monetization strategy is taking shape. It’s clear from Zuckerberg’s words today that Meta plans to deliver “personal superintelligence” through its own products like augmented reality glasses and virtual reality headsets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices,” Zuckerberg wrote in Wednesday’s letter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked about Meta potentially keeping its most advanced models closed, a Meta spokesperson said that the company remains committed to open source AI and said it also expects to train closed source models in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our position on open source AI is unchanged,” a spokesperson said. “We plan to continue releasing leading open source models. We haven’t released everything we’ve developed historically and we expect to continue training a mix of open and closed models going forward.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated with more information about Mark Zuckerberg’s stance on open AI models. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

does Edits differ from CapCut?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While both Edits and CapCut are great options for editing short-form videos, there are some differences between the two services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CapCut offers more robust editing options, including AI features, than Edits does. Of course, this can be expected since Edits is a lot newer than CapCut. Meta will likely continue to build out Edits over the next months and years, so we can expect to see more advanced functionality in the future. It’s also worth noting that CapCut has a more extensive music library compared to Edits.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another difference is the fact that Edits currently doesn’t have a subscription offering (for now), but CapCut does. While CapCut offers a free version, some of its advanced tools are locked behind a paid subscription. Edits is free to use, but this will likely change in the future, as Instagram head <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DH5zeEAxgw5/?e=167cb3b3-3baa-4f70-8c08-b6735eaaa7e6&amp;g=5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Adam Mosseri has stated</a> that later versions of Edits may include paid features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, while CapCut is available on the web, Edits is mobile-only. However, this could change in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: This story originally ran in May and is updated regularly with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As the global economy transitions away from fossil fuels, it is going to need <a href=\"https://news.umich.edu/copper-cant-be-mined-fast-enough-to-electrify-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">twice as much copper</a> in the coming years than humanity has mined throughout all of its existence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.stillbright.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Still Bright</a>, a New Jersey-based startup founded in 2022, thinks it has found a novel (and cleaner way) to slash those costs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fact that we’ve already mined the easily mineable stuff, and the fact that we need many more mines to come into production every year — we’re talking like 60-plus mines — is it seems like an impossibility, like there’s no path to get there,” Randy Allen, co-founder and CEO of Still Bright, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a large fraction of that demand could be met if companies can extract more copper from the ore they already mine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still Bright has developed a new way to extract copper, one that it says can recover nearly all the copper from typical ores without pre-processing steps that lose up to 20% of the metal. It’s effective enough that it could even be used on tailings, the discard piles that still contain smaller amounts of the metal that mines leave behind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Any copper that was lost as waste, we can actually process that and get the copper back,” Allen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To boost production from single digits to hundreds of tons per year, Still Bright has raised an $18.7 million seed round led by Material Impact and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Azolla Ventures, Fortescue, Impact Science Ventures, and SOSV participated.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still Bright’s technology allows it to extract copper without producing harmful pollution. Where most companies essentially burn away unwanted parts of the ore — releasing much of it into the atmosphere — Still Bright soaks copper-containing ores in a vanadium-based solution, which draws the metal out of the ore. When the vanadium solution is spent, the company’s system uses electricity to regenerate it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The core technology was inspired by a type of long-duration energy storage known as a “vanadium flow battery.” In it, a vanadium-based solution that can be stored in large tanks is charged and discharged by flowing it past a membrane. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of this is kind of happenstance. The technical inventor, the CTO of the company Jon [Vardner], he was working on two different projects,” Allen said, one on vanadium flow batteries and another on using vanadium to extract copper. “It’s connecting the dots. One person happened to be doing both.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still Bright’s modular system will be able to be installed at mines spanning a range of sizes. Because the vanadium-based process works so quickly, the company’s equipment is much smaller than a typical refiner for the same amount of copper production. “The processing is on the order of minutes, up to an hour. That allows us to keep everything really small.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The small size pays financial dividends, too. Allen said that Still Bright’s equipment is 70% to 90% cheaper than typical pyrometallurgical gear. Currently, the company’s process costs about the same to run as a typical refinery, but Allen expects that to change. “There’s a lot of opportunity for us to be cheaper,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still Bright is planning to build a demonstration unit in 2027 or 2028 that’s capable of producing 500 tons of copper annually. It’s a big leap from the current pilot scale unit, which makes 2 tons per year. The ultimate commercial-scale system will produce 10,000 tons per year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The clock is ticking, though. Still Bright would like to start refining copper in large enough quantities to benefit from any tariffs President Trump might impose on imports of the metal. If it does, it can use that revenue to develop and deploy commercial-scale units.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We see ourselves as having a path to be among the cheapest copper producers,” Allen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to correct the name of one of the investors. Azolla Ventures, not Apollo Ventures, invested in Still Bright.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Silicon Valley races toward a future where AI agents do most of the software programming, a new problem is created: finding the AI-generated bugs before they are put into production. Even OpenAI is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/a-former-openai-engineer-describes-what-its-really-like-to-work-there/\">dealing with such issues, </a>a former employee has described. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Newly funded startup <a href=\"https://playerzero.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PlayerZero</a> has created a solution: use AI agents trained to find and fix problems before the code is put into production, the startup’s CEO and sole founder, Animesh Koratana, tells TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Koratana created PlayerZero while he was at the Stanford DAWN lab for machine learning under his adviser and lab founder, Matei Zaharia. Zaharia is, of course, a famed developer and the co-founder of Databricks; he created its foundational technology while working on his own doctorate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PlayerZero on Wednesday announced that it raised a $15 million Series A led by Foundation Capital’s Ashu Garg, an early Databricks backer. This follows a $5 million seed led by Green Bay Ventures and several noteworthy angels, including Zaharia, Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, Figma CEO Dylan Field, and Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his time at Stanford DAWN, Koratana, now 26, was working on AI model compression technology and “got exposed to language models really early on,” he says. He met the developers who crafted some of the first AI coding assistance tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It hit him then that “there’s this world in which computers are going to write the code. It’s not going to be humans anymore,” Koratana tells TechCrunch. ”What’s the world going to look like at that point?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He knew before the term “AI slop” was even coined that these agents were going to produce code that broke things just as their human overseers do.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That problem would also be exacerbated by so many agents cranking out so much more code than has ever been written before. It won’t always be practical for humans to check all AI-written code for bugs or hallucinations. And the issue becomes even more intense for the large, complex code bases that enterprises rely upon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PlayerZero trains models “that really deeply understand code bases, and we understand the way they’re built, the way they’re architected,” Koratana says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His tech studies the history of an enterprise’s bugs, issues, and solutions. When something breaks, his product can then “figure out why and fix it, and then learn from those mistakes to prevent them from ever happening again,” Koratana says. He likens his product to an immune system for large code bases.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Landing Zaharia, his adviser, as an angel was a first step to fundraising, but the moment that really validated his idea was when he showed a demo to another famous developer: Rauch. Rauch is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/vercel-completes-250-mln-series-e-round-325-bln-valuation-2024-05-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">triple-unicorn developer tool company</a> Vercel and creator of the popular open source JavaScript framework <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Next.js</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rauch watched Koratana’s demo with interest but skepticism, asking how much of it was “real.” Koratana replied that this was code “running in production. Like, this is a real instance. And he was quiet,” Koratana says. Then his soon-to-be-angel investor responded, “If you can actually solve this the way that you’re imagining, it’s a really big deal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, PlayerZero isn’t alone in attempting to solve the AI-generated bug problem. Just last week, Anysphere’s Cursor <a href=\"https://cursor.com/bugbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Bugbot</a> to detect coding errors, as just one example.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, PlayerZero is already gaining traction for its emphasis on large codebases. While it was conceived for a world where agents are the coders, it is currently being used by several large enterprises that use coding co-pilots. For instance, subscription billing company Zuora is one of the startup’s marquee customers. Zuora is using the tech across its engineering teams, including to watchdog its most precious code, its billing systems, it said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
