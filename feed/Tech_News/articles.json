The rise of AI — which has increased both the volume of data that companies handle and concerns about data leaks — has helped Cyera sign up one-fifth of the Fortune 500 companies as customers and more than triple revenue in its last year, the company says, causing investors to eagerly pile in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

An alarming range of women have been affected by the non-consensual nudes, including prominent models and actresses, as well as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/01/06/x-grok-deepfake-sexual-abuse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">news figures</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/billdmccarthy/status/2009327842468003882?s=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">crime victims</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/elon-musk-grok-sexual-images-ashley-st-clair.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">world leaders</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://copyleaks.com/blog/grok-and-nonconsensual-image-manipulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A December 31 research paper from Copyleaks</a> estimated roughly one image was being posted each minute, but later tests found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/08/grok-x-nonconsensual-images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">far more.</a> A sample gathered from January 5-6 found <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2Nzc5MDk4NywiZXhwIjoxNzY4Mzk1Nzg3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOEhRS0hLR0lGUE8wMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.3B4JWnmqmXFC3DOqhs11h99g5gNzi4j_poKAHLuWdrY&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while public figures from around the world have decried the choice to release the model without safeguards, there are few clear mechanisms for regulators hoping to rein in Elon Musk’s new image-manipulating system. The result has become a painful lesson in the limits of tech regulation — and a forward-looking challenge for regulators hoping to make a mark.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, the most aggressive action has come from the European Commission, which on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-commission-has-ordered-x-retain-all-grok-documents-until-end-2026-2026-01-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ordered xAI to retain all documents</a> related to its Grok chatbot. The move doesn’t necessarily mean the commission has opened up a new investigation, but it’s a common precursor to such action. It’s particularly ominous given <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/tech/elon-musk-xai-digital-undressing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent reporting from CNN</a> that suggests Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent safeguards from being placed on what images could be generated by Grok.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear whether X has made any technical changes to the Grok model, although the public media tab for Grok’s X account has been removed. In a statement, the company specifically denounced the use of AI tools to produce child sexual imagery. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the X Safety account <a href=\"https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted on January 3</a>, echoing a previous tweet by Elon Musk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, regulators around the world have issued stern warnings. The United Kingdom’s Ofcom <a href=\"https://x.com/Ofcom/status/2008201578378084550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">issued a statement on Monday</a>, saying it was in touch with xAI and “will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9jxvx0zjmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a radio interview on Thursday</a>, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the phenomenon “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” saying “Ofcom has our full support to take action in relation to this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7414540088329723904-Y8cH/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAEplZ4Bv8TsVQuhGbv7X0jbnsxlrOzlzOU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a post on LinkedIn</a>, Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant said her office had received a doubling in complaints related to Grok since late 2025. But Inman-Grant stopped short of taking action against xAI, saying only, “We will use the range of regulatory tools at our disposal to investigate and take appropriate action.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By far the largest market to threaten action is India, where Grok was the subject of a formal complaint from a member of Parliament. On January, India’s communications regulator MeitY ordered X to address the issue and submit an “action-taken” report within 72 hours — a deadline that was subsequently extended by 48 hours. While a report was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/x-says-its-introducing-more-grok-guardrails-refining-safeguards/articleshow/126400465.cms\">submitted to the regulator on January 7</a>, it’s unclear whether MeitY will be satisfied with the response. If not, X could lose its safe harbor status in India, a potentially serious limitation on its ability to operate within the country.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In this season finale episode of Build Mode, our guest has an answer: Startups have focused too much on product development and not enough on distribution excellence. Paul Irving is partner and COO at GTMfund, which operates under the thesis that distribution is the final moat in the AI era. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The traditional go-to-market playbook lays out a one-size-fits-all approach to hiring and scaling that may have worked in the days of traditional enterprise SaaS but won’t cut it in the crowded, AI-driven startup era of 2025. Innovation cycles are moving faster than ever, and what used to take several years can now be achieved in just a few months. So Irving and the GTMfund team advise their portfolio companies to differentiate in their distribution rather than their product. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The aperture for how you build your go-to-market or revenue engine and the decisions you make to get there have never had more unique and specific pathways depending on your company,” Irving said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this episode, Irving dove into several specific examples of what he’s seen work for startups. The main takeaways: AI can help small teams hone their data-driven approach and find direct lines to their customer base through creative means; in the early days, founders can’t tackle all distribution channels at once; hiring should be approached thoughtfully without a traditional mindset; and building a team of trusted advisers should be a top priority. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early-stage investors, at least at GTMfund, aren’t looking for startups that have spent half their budget on paid ads or hired a full sales team. They want to see founders get creative with how they reach their unique customers. Irving laid out an example of one startup that became an active participant in several relevant Facebook groups. “If you think about it in the framework of, okay, it’s a thousand people, but 700 of them are my actual ICP and buyer because of the specific groups that either we started as a company or the ones that we’ve become the most active posters in. It can become a really unique channel if you’re looking to bring on 40, 50, 60 new customers in a given year,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Irving argues that the aperture for going to market has never been broader, so it’s crucial for founders to carve out a creative approach for reaching their target customer. However, founders can’t and shouldn’t do it alone. A refrain throughout this conversation is the importance of a robust network. GTMfund provides their portfolio companies with a vast network of operators, but they won’t just hand founders a Rolodex — they create bespoke pairings to ensure that there will be value in the meeting for everyone involved. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think what’s wonderful about the venture-backed ecosystem more generally is people’s willingness to help. They know how hard it is to build a company. They know how low the likelihood of success is in the grand scheme of things, but people are always willing. If you come and you’re curious, you teach them something as part of that as well. People are usually willing to open up doors,” Irving said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The new rules of early-stage go to market (hint: there are no rules) l Build Mode\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xj7-ci5M51A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Isabelle Johannessen is our host.

While the report contains promises to respect human rights and have controls to demand its customers do the same, the report provides no concrete evidence supporting either. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Experts and critics who have followed NSO and the spyware market for years believe the report is part of an effort and campaign by the company to get the U.S. government to remove the company from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/\">a blocklist</a> — technically called the Entity List — as it hopes to enter the U.S. market with new financial backers and executives at the helm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/spyware-maker-nso-group-confirms-acquisition-by-us-investors/\">a group of U.S. investors acquired the company</a>, and since then, NSO has been undergoing a transition that included high-profile personnel changes: former Trump official David Friedman <a href=\"https://therecord.media/former-trump-official-named-nso-group-chairman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was appointed</a> the new executive chairman; CEO Yaron Shohat stepped down; and Omri Lavie, the last remaining founder who was still involved in the company, also left, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2026-01-01/ty-article/.premium/spyware-firm-nsos-chief-steps-down-as-u-s-lifts-sanctions-on-intellexa-executives/0000019b-79e6-d585-abdf-7ff798ea0000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When NSO’s products are in the right hands within the right countries, the world is a far safer place.

After President Donald Trump took office again last year, NSO intensified these efforts.

Without naming the customers, the company said it cut ties with one, and imposed on another customer “alternative remediation measures,” including mandating human rights training, monitoring the customer activities, and requesting more information about how the customer uses the system. NSO did not provide any information about the third investigation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NSO also said that during 2024, the company rejected more than $20 million “in new business opportunities due to human rights concerns.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the <a href=\"https://www.nsogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-Transparency-and-Responsibility-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">transparency report</a> published the prior year, covering 2022 and 2023, NSO said it suspended or terminated six government customers, without naming them, claiming these actions resulted in a revenue loss of $57 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2021, NSO <a href=\"https://www.nsogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ReportBooklet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> it had “disconnected” the systems of five customers since 2016 following an investigation of misuse, resulting in more than $100 million in “estimated loss of revenue,” and it also said that it “discontinued engagements” with five customers due to “concerns regarding human rights.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NSO’s newest transparency report does not include the total number of customers NSO has, statistics that have been consistently present in previous reports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch asked NSO spokesperson Gil Lanier to provide similar statistics and figures, but did not receive answers by press time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that has investigated spyware abuses for more than a decade, criticized NSO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was expecting information, numbers,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “Nothing in this document allows outsiders to verify NSO’s claims, which is business as usual from a company that has a decade-long history of making claims that later turned out to be misrepresentation.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This process creates tiny bubbles, resulting in a silky-smooth, naturally sweeter taste — similar to drinking a Guinness. Many people also note that nitro coffee is less bitter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EverNitro is positioning itself against competitors such as NitroBrew as a long-term more affordable all-in-one solution. “We offer the quality of a commercial tap with the footprint of a coffee maker. While others sell you gas, we give you technology to harvest it for free,” founder and CEO Terry Tan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The company claims EverNitro delivers 95% nitrogen purity and highlights its ability to generate nitrogen directly from the surrounding air. By eliminating the need for single-use cartridges, the device provides a less expensive, environmentally friendly solution for home use.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081293\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EverNitro.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>XBREW Lab</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After testing it ourselves, we were pleasantly surprised.

The Lite option costs $470 and includes just the machine and canister, while backers can purchase it for $290. The Pro version is $583 (or $337 for backers) and comes with the machine, two canisters, a coffee bean preservation jar, and whipped cream kits.​ Yet, for comparison’s sake, a countertop unit of <a href=\"https://nitrobrew.com/product/nitrobrew-tabletop-system-single/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NitroBrew</a> costs about $1,000.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, Tan told TechCrunch that the team is “exploring how gases can fundamentally elevate the texture of all beverages, not just coffee.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CES is always chock-full of robots, and this year electronics giant LG announced a new bot, dubbed CLOid, that it claims will revolutionize household chores (as in, you won’t have to do them anymore).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CLOid is described as an AI-powered home robot, designed to assist its user with a wide variety of domestic tasks — from folding laundry to making breakfast to patrolling a home for signs of trouble. The company <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/global/newsroom/news/corporate/lg-electronics-unveils-its-approach-to-ai-in-action/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">says that</a>, eventually, it envisions the device “evolving into an ambient-care agent that supports everyday life.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bot was announced during LG’s keynote earlier this week, but it was also available for inspection via rolling presentations on the convention room floor. I went to check one out, where I saw the bot, alongside a human presenter, performing a variety of tasks for an enthusiastic audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CLOid has autonomous movement, so it can get around by itself, and comes equipped with a variety of cameras and sensors that, when paired with LG’s <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/lg-thinq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">smart home ThinQ app</a>, can leverage situational and environmental data to make proactive suggestions for how to make its user’s life better, LG says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bot also has speakers so it can communicate with its user. LG says that CLOid runs off a vision language model that converts “images and video into structured, language-based understanding” and a vision language action program that can convert verbal commands into action (you know, like Siri).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The last few years have seen the introduction of a number of domestic robots, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/amazon-discontinues-astro-for-business-security-robot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon’s Astro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/home/home-security/enabot-ebo-x-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Enabot’s EBO X</a>. CLOid follows in their footsteps but seems designed for a broader array of domestic tasks than its predecessors. Unlike Astro and EBO (which are little more than squat, rolling automatons), CLOid has a large upper body and two arms — a physicality clearly designed to lift stuff and interact with its environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You’d think that would lead to some impressive results, right? Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOid didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CLOid was cute, and seemed affable enough, but the biggest thing you notice is how <em>slow </em>it is. During Tuesday’s presentation, when his human counterpart asked CLOid to make him some breakfast, the robot trundled over to the refrigerator, waited for the automatic door to open, and then stared into the fridge’s depths for an uncomfortably long period of time before ultimately selecting milk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, even the most lethargic human would likely win in a race against CLOid. However, speed isn’t really the issue here. The idea is to make sure that the bot’s human companion doesn’t have to do any work at all. It’s part of what LG refers to as its “<a href=\"https://www.lg.com/global/newsroom/news/corporate/lg-electronics-unveils-its-approach-to-ai-in-action/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zero Labor Home</a>” model, where automation takes care of all of those boring but essential domestic chores. You can be off brushing your teeth or answering a call from your boss while the bot is in the next room, prepping pancakes. That’s the idea, at least.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From the available presentation, it’s a little unclear when that idea will become a reality. I was unable to find out if and when the bot would actually be available to the public. A disclaimer at the bottom of the presentation’s videos read: “Products and solutions shown in this video are under development and not been released for commercial use, thus specifications may vary.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An on-site LG communications staffer told me that CLOid would be available in the future, but she didn’t know when. I reached out to LG’s Home Solutions team for more information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thus, like a lot of other robots on display at CES, CLOid felt a little more like an ad for its company’s potential than an accurate representation of what it is currently offering. The bot also seemed well positioned to help market LG’s new AI home ecosystem, which represents a broader array of impressive smart home products, the bulk of which seem like easier lifts for consumers than a new robot in their home. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I got a brief tour of some of the latest editions of those products. In addition to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/lgs-new-oled-tv-is-just-9mm-thick/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">return of the LG Wallpaper</a> (having spent a few minutes staring into its insanely thin but beautifully hypnotic surface, I can safely say I want one), the company had <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-electronics-unveils-its-approach-to-ai-in-action-302652844.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a variety of appliances</a> on display this week, including an AI-powered oven that can identify particular ingredients and recommend recipes for you, and an AI refrigerator that you can talk to. All of these devices are supposed to synch with CLOid and are controllable via the company’s <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/lg-thinq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ThinQ app</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Convogo’s product will be wound down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem — as in the case of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/openai-buys-sky-an-ai-interface-for-mac/\">Sky</a>, the AI interface for Mac, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/openai-acquires-product-testing-startup-statsig-and-shakes-up-its-leadership-team/\">Statsig</a>, a product testing firm — or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/with-its-latest-acqui-hire-openai-is-doubling-down-on-personalized-consumer-ai/\">Roi</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/openai-hires-team-behind-gv-backed-ai-eval-platform-context-ai/\">Context.ai</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/openai-hires-team-behind-ai-recommendation-startup-crossing-minds/\">Crossing Minds</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Convogo deal also signals that OpenAI, like its competitors, is using M&amp;A as a talent and capability accelerator.

Nevertheless, that is what happened at CES on Wednesday, when Oculus creator Palmer Luckey and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian gave a joint talk about the joys of “tech nostalgia.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luckey, who initially made his fortune in VR and now runs the defense contractor Anduril, and Ohanian both seemed to agree: Stuff was better in the old days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The catch, however, is that Luckey and Ohanian weren’t really criticizing technology itself (Luckey said, during his remarks, that he supported AI and felt it was changing workflows for the better); instead, they were criticizing the aesthetics of technology. Vintage consumer tech products, they argued, are superior to today’s — and it’s the styles and form factor of the past that will determine tech’s future, they claimed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not just about nostalgia for the old; it’s about the fact that it’s just objectively better,” Ohanian said of some older products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After going on a short tirade about how great the 1999 first-person shooter Quake: Arena is, Luckey similarly sang the praises of old-school media. “There is something that used to exist in the intentionality of building a music library — whether that was building whole albums or building mix tapes,” Luckey said, adding that, in the era of endless downloads, you clearly “lose something.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luckey also pointed to younger people who are nostalgic for time periods that they don’t even remember or have any personal connection to. “Why do they think it’s good? It’s not because they’re remembering their childhoods. It’s not because they’re harkening back to some earlier time. It’s because they’re recognizing that it is literally better, some of this old stuff.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Certain consumer trends would seem to suggest that Luckey and Ohanian are on to something. Nostalgia is obviously big across the board these days (look at all those 1980s period pieces coming out of Hollywood), but <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/17/gen-z-fashion-nostalgia-retro-tech-backlash-millennials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nostalgic tech design</a> is a particularly thriving niche. Young people are overwhelmed and oversaturated by the internet. As a result, many have developed new interests in physical media — like collecting cassettes and vinyl. Meanwhile, new, low-tech devices with retro designs are also seeing an uptick in interest (just check out the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/clicks-debuts-its-own-take-on-the-blackberry-smartphone-plus-a-79-snap-on-mobile-keyboard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Clicks Communicator phone</a> that debuted at CES this year).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that consumer interests are trending this direction, Luckey and Ohanian’s enthusiasm for vintage tech could also just end up being a savvy business strategy. That is, if Americans are feeling nostalgic, you might as well monetize it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, Luckey has already been doing this. The defense contractor, who sports <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/09/nx-s1-4985981/oculus-ai-weapons-ukraine-palmer-luckey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an ’80s mullet</a>, launched a project in 2024 called <a href=\"https://modretro.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooGeFXSVv8DS_7E1zSMRvpBXkwjWeyy54HAl5CL0eZ1mDqLzVdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ModRetro Chromatic</a> — a Game Boy-like device that retails for $199, allows gameplay of old cartridge classics from the 1990s, and has been called one of “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the best ever made</a>” of its kind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, Ohanian brought one of the ModRetro units onstage and proudly showed it off to the crowd. Ohanian, who has spoken very publicly about his love for Luckey’s gaming company, has also said he’s interested in creating his own vintage-style game.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were a lot of colorful moments during Wednesday’s talk, most of which were generated by Luckey. At one point, he shared that he had been coming to CES since he was 16. Astute CES fans will note: You’re supposed to be 18 to get in. “I used a fake ID,” Luckey told a CES audience on Wednesday, to much laughter. “I pretended that I worked for a company that was exhibiting here,” the mogul said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cute retro games may be the future but so, too, is war, it would seem. Since 2017, Luckey has largely been focused on his defense startup Anduril. Earlier this year, in the wake of a Series G fundraising round, the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anduril-raises-2-5b-at-30-5b-valuation-led-by-founders-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">valuation swelled to $30.5 billion</a>. Lately, the company has been collaborating with Meta on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/in-a-victory-for-palmer-luckey-meta-and-anduril-work-on-mixed-reality-headsets-for-the-military/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">headsets for the U.S. military</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anduril hardly came up during Wednesday’s talk, but toward the end of the conversation, Luckey pivoted briefly to a discussion about foreign policy to make some characteristically wild claims. “I was part of the problem for a long time, making all of my stuff in China,” he said. “Geopolitically, the United States and China are going through a divorce; it’s a messy divorce — and if people think that it’s going to end with reconciliation, they’re blind. It’s not,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera.

(Observability platforms help companies monitor their software systems and data for performance issues and bugs.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cloud data company announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Observe, subject to regulatory approval, on January 8. Snowflake will integrate Observe’s product into its own to give customers a unified place to collect and store their telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces from software systems) and better spot potential bugs and issues in their data and software.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Observe was founded in 2017 by Jacob Leverich, Jonathan Trevor, and Ang Li and launched its first observability product built on a centralized Snowflake database in 2018. The company was incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures and has since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/observe-continues-to-adapt-to-the-changing-world-of-software-observability/\">raised nearly $500 million in venture capital</a> from firms including Snowflake Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Madrona, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, both Snowflake and Observe were incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures, with Sutter Hill managing director Mike Speiser serving as Snowflake’s founding CEO from 2012 to 2014.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jeremy Burton, the current CEO of Observe, has served on Snowflake’s board of directors since 2015.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Integrating Observe into Snowflake allows users to proactively monitor their data stack and spot and fix issues 10x faster than before, according to a <a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-announces-intent-to-acquire-observe-to-deliver-ai-powered-observability-at-enterprise-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Snowflake blog post</a> — a task that has become harder to scale due to the sheer volume of data generated by AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition also creates a unified framework for telemetry data, which is automatically collected, built on Apache Iceberg and OpenTelemetry architectures.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

TechCrunch has reached out to Snowflake for more information on the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year saw a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/ai-is-forcing-the-data-industry-to-consolidate-but-thats-not-the-whole-story/\">wave of consolidation</a> in the data industry as data companies looked to build out their product offerings to make themselves more attractive one-stop-shop partners in the age of AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal could be a sign that data company consolidation will continue in 2026.

He resigned from the board in 2018 after his bid to take over as CEO was rejected by the other co-founders, who put Altman up for the job. Officially, Musk cited potential conflicts of interest with Tesla’s own AI development for self-driving cars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since leaving OpenAI, he’s been a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/30/elon-musk-files-for-injunction-to-halt-openais-transition-to-a-for-profit/\">vocal critic</a> of the firm’s transition to a for-profit model, and even made an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/elon-musk-led-team-submits-97-4b-bid-for-openai/\">unsolicited $97.4 billion bid</a> to buy OpenAI in February 2025, which Altman rejected. OpenAI, which was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, first began to move away from its pure nonprofit roots in 2019 by creating a for-profit subsidiary with a “capped-profit” model that limited investor returns. This was designed to help OpenAI raise the massive amounts of funding it needed to scale and attract top talent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s lawsuit was unable to stop OpenAI from converting into a nonprofit, and in October 2025, the corporation <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/openai-completes-its-for-profit-recapitalization/\">completed its formal restructuring process</a>. The for-profit branch became a Public Benefit Corporation, with the original nonprofit retaining a 26% equity stake. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk is now seeking monetary damages from what he says are “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI. He says he invested about $38 million in early funding, as well as guidance and credibility, based on assurances that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch Musk’s lawsuit is “baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said her decision was based on evidence suggesting OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure would be maintained, as Musk alleges.

For the past couple of years, most AI investment has focused on winning over enterprise customers, who provide fat checks, multi-year contracts, and quick paths to scale.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But one VC sees the consumer sector gearing up for a comeback in 2026. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is gonna be the year of the consumer,” said Vanessa Larco, partner at the venture firm Premise and a former partner at NEA, on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/investing-in-the-consumer-ai-products-openai-wont-want-to-kill/\">this week’s episode</a> of the Equity podcast.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says that even though enterprises have big budgets and a frantic desire to implement AI solutions, adoption often stalls because “they don’t know where to start.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fun thing about consumer and prosumer…is that people already have in mind what they want to use it for,” Larco continued. “And so they purchase it, and if it meets the need, they just keep using it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, adoption is quicker, and startups building AI products don’t have to guess whether they’ve actually achieved product-market fit or have just won a contract. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re selling to consumers, you’ll know very quickly if it’s fitting a need or not, and you’ll know quickly whether you need to pivot or make some changes to your product or totally scrap it and start something totally different,” Larco said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And in today’s anxiety-inducing economy, consumer tech products that manage to scale demonstrate an especially strong product-market fit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are early indications that consumer tech is having a moment. Late last year, OpenAI launched apps in ChatGPT, allowing users to shop with the Target app, scour the housing market with Zillow, book trips with Expedia, or make a Spotify playlist, all through the ChatGPT chatbot experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is gonna feel like concierge-like services, which will do everything for you that you have in mind,” Larco said. “The question is, which of it should be specialized, and which should be general purpose?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or put differently, as OpenAI works to make ChatGPT the new operating system of the consumer internet, which legacy companies — like Tripadvisor or WebMD — will continue to exist in their own right, and which will get eaten by OpenAI?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Larco does think 2026 is going to be a “gangbuster” year for M&amp;A, she’s interested in investing in startups that “OpenAI isn’t going to want to kill.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI doesn’t manage real-world assets,” she said. “I don’t think they’ll build an Airbnb competitor because I don’t think they’re gonna want to manage homes…I don’t think they’re going to build any of these marketplaces that require real humans because they don’t want to manage the humans.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from which startups can fill the gaps, Larco is watching out for what happens if OpenAI “decides to pull an Apple or Android where they take a 30% cut of all the traffic they send you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Is Airbnb gonna want to play ball with that?” she asked. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Larco predicts new monetization strategies and fresh business models will emerge from the evolved consumer experience online. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-social-has-to-change\"><strong>“Social has to change”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While doomscrolling on Instagram about Trump’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Larco noticed something. She had come to the platform to get news on the escalating crisis, but instead she was overwhelmingly flooded with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/technology/nicolas-maduro-ai-images-deepfakes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI-generated Maduro slop</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While deepfakes have been steadily becoming mainstream on social media, this was one of the first major news events where AI-generated slop muddied the waters of the truth. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At that point, I was like, if I’m just gonna be watching AI-generated videos and photos, I want it to be funny,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says she has been inundated with enough realistic-looking AI videos on social media that she just assumes it’s all AI at this point, and she’s not alone. If we all start to assume that nothing we see on Meta’s platforms or TikTok is real anymore, the question will be, where do you get the real stuff?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says others might fill in the gaps of where to find truthful, non-AI content as platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/reddit-will-tighten-verification-to-keep-out-human-like-ai-bots/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/digg-founder-kevin-rose-on-the-need-for-trusted-social-communities-in-the-ai-era/\">Digg</a> make moves to verify humanity. But for Meta? Maybe it just becomes an entertainment company, a platform for user-generated short films.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we should move on from getting your news from [Meta],” Larco said. “You are just getting funny videos from there. It’s not social media. It’s just gaming and entertainment media.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-some-things-are-better-with-voice-than-a-screen\"><strong>“Some things are better with voice than a screen</strong>“</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047721\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Navigation-Lifestyle.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Meta Ray-Ban display</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta / Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/\">Meta acquired AI agent startup Manus</a> last week, many saw it as an enterprise play. Larco thinks it could be a move geared at improving Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a product the VC is a huge fan of because they allow her to answer phone calls, respond to messages, take photos and videos, and ask Meta AI questions, all without having to pull out her phone and navigate a screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Larco says she thinks truly useful voice AI assistants are finally “on the cusp of happening,” fueled by more advanced tech and more robust compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some things are better with voice than a screen,” she said. “And because voice sucked, we needed the screen as a crutch. But I would love to start separating out what things are really better on a screen and what things are just better with audio.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Getting answers to questions her kids ask about what the tallest building is? Definitely voice. Taking out her phone to type in the question now feels “archaic,” Larco said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think it’ll be really fun for designers because they finally get to pick and choose what form factor is better for what use cases,” she said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Although he declined to share sales numbers, he said that over the past week, the company was making a sale every 6.5 seconds between both devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the prototype we tried was not a fully functional phone, it’s the same size and weight as the device that’s preparing to ship later this year, giving an initial feel for what it would be like to use the Communicator. Onboard storage lands at 256 gigabytes, with expandable microSD storage of up to 2 terabytes of data. The device will also sport a 4000mAh silicon-carbon battery and is currently weighing in around 170 grams (or 6 oz). Underneath the back is where your nano-SIM card will go. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phone also comes with interchangeable back covers that you can pop off to change its look. While not present on the prototype, the cover will have a small notch at the top and then a little finger pick at the bottom.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg\" alt=\"a photo showing TechCrunch holding a green Clicks Communicator device, featuring its red lit-up notification button on the side of the device.\" class=\"wp-image-3081106\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg 5076w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0676.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 5076px) 100vw, 5076px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where the device’s light-up side button can help. Called the “Signal Light,” the button can be configured to glow with different colors or patterns when you receive messages from certain people, groups, or apps. So you can be sure to respond if it’s your boss or the kids contacting you and ignore less important notifications.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg\" alt=\"a screenshot showing a close-up of the lit-up button on the side of the Clicks Communicator. it's featuring a red lit-up button to show messages from certain people, and different colors for other people or types of messages that the user can prioritize.\" class=\"wp-image-3079419\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Clicks</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tactile, physical keys feel good, though the prototype’s version may actually be a little less “clicky” than the final product.

Additionally, Gmail is bringing to all users several AI features that were previously available only to paid users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new AI Inbox tab features two sections: “Suggested to-dos” and “Topics to catch up on.” The first section displays summaries of top priority emails that require an action, such as a reminder that you have a bill due tomorrow or that you need to call your dermatologist to confirm your mailing address so they can ship your prescription refill.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the “Topics to catch up on” section, you’ll see updates such as “Your Lululemon return is being processed, and your order of Metal Vent Tech shirts has been delivered” and “Your end-of-year statement is now available from Wealthfront.” These different updates are grouped into different categories, such as “Finances” and “Purchases.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080898\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Inbox-Image.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back, showing you what you need to do and when you need to do it,” said Blake Barnes, VP, Product at Google, in a briefing with reporters. “Don’t worry, the traditional inbox will remain available. This is simply a new view you can toggle in and out of as you please to cut through the noise of your incoming mail.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is rolling out the AI Inbox feature to trusted testers before making it more broadly available in the coming months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the new AI Overviews in Gmail search, users can now search their inbox using natural language questions to get a quick answer instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080899\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overviews-search-Image.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI-powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says all of Gmail’s AI features are optional, that it doesn’t use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it’s designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080900\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png 2568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=1200,670 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=1280,715 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=430,240 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=720,402 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=900,503 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=800,447 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=1536,858 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=2048,1144 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=668,373 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=1105,617 1105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=708,395 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-2.54.38-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It’ll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It’s essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Proofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail’s “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users.
