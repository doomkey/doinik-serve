Another former OpenAI staffer who went to work for Murati’s startup is also headed back to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On social media on Wednesday, Murati announced the departure of Barret Zoph, the company’s co-founder and CTO. “We have parted ways with Barret,” Murati said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/miramurati/status/2011577319295692801?s=20\">in a post on X</a>. “Soumith Chintala will be the new CTO of Thinking Machines. He is a brilliant and seasoned leader who has made important contributions to the AI field for over a decade, and he’s been a major contributor to our team. We could not be more excited to have him take on this new responsibility.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murati’s announcement made no mention of other departures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just 58 minutes after Murati’s announcement of Zoph’s departure, Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, announced that Zoph would be headed back to OpenAI. “Excited to welcome Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, and Sam Schoenholz back to OpenAI! This has been in the works for several weeks, and we’re thrilled to have them join the team,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/fidjissimo/status/2011592010881446116?s=20\">Simo wrote on X</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Metz <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lsvp.com/company/thinking-machines/\">is another co-founder</a> of Thinking Machines and previously <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-metz-5003046a/\">worked for OpenAI</a> for a number of years on the company’s technical staff. So did Schoenholz, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-schoenholz-379830a0/\">whose LinkedIn profile</a> still lists him as working for Thinking Machines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoph previously worked for OpenAI as VP of research, and before that, worked for six years at Google as a research scientist. Murati, who served as the CTO of OpenAI until September 2024, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/technology/mira-murati-openai.html\">left the company</a> and co-founded Thinking Machines with Zoph and Metz. The startup, where Murati serves as CEO, has amassed significant financial support since then, closing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\">a $2 billion seed round</a> last July, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, which led the round, as well as Accel, Nvidia, AMD, and Jane Street, among others. The round valued the company at $12 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to both Thinking Machines and OpenAI for comment. Wired reports that the split between Zoph and Thinking Labs <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/thinking-machines-lab-cofounders-leave-for-openai/\">wasn’t amicable</a>. Certainly, it’s telling that Murati didn’t write more in her public messaging about his departure from the company.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While talent moves between AI giants are common in Silicon Valley, the departure of co-founders from a startup less than a year after its founding is particularly notable. The loss of two co-founders simultaneously — especially when one served as CTO — could be perceived as a particularly meaningful setback for Thinking Machines, which had assembled a high-profile team of former OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral AI researchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also lost other key personnel, including co-founder Andrew Tulloch, who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/11/thinking-machines-lab-co-founder-andrew-tulloch-heads-to-meta/\">left to join Meta</a> in October. OpenAI itself has seen numerous co-founders depart to launch or join competing ventures, including John Schulman, who left for Anthropic in August 2024 before joining Thinking Machines Lab as Chief Scientist as its launch in February of last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The finalized order, which comes a year after the agency reached a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/gm-banned-from-sharing-driving-and-location-data-with-insurance-companies/\">proposed settlement</a> with GM, also requires the automaker to be more transparent with its consumers and obtain their explicit consent on any data collection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/GMAdminOrderDec2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">finalized order</a> comes nearly two years after a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">New York Times report </a>showed how GM and OnStar collected, used, and sold drivers’ precise geolocation data and driving behavior to third parties, including data brokers LexisNexis and Verisk. The data was collected through GM’s Smart Driver program, a free feature contained within its connected car apps that tracked and rated driving behaviors and seatbelt use. Data brokers sold this information to insurance providers, which could affect customers’ rates, the NYT reported at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM <a href=\"https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2024/apr/0424-driver.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discontinued</a> the Smart Driver program in April 2024 across all of its brands, citing customer feedback. GM said at the time it unenrolled all customers and ended its third-party telematics relationships with LexisNexis and Verisk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FTC alleged that GM and OnStar used a misleading enrollment process to get consumers to sign up for its OnStar connected vehicle service and OnStar Smart Driver feature. The FTC also alleged the automaker failed to clearly disclose that the data would be collected and sold to third parties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the order finalized Wednesday, GM is also required to obtain explicit consent from consumers prior to collecting, using, or sharing connected vehicle data. This process occurs at the dealership when a consumer buys a car from a GM brand. At that point, the OnStar system is linked to that particular vehicle VIN number and the new owner is asked whether they agree or not with data collection, according to GM.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some exceptions to the data collection ban, however. GM is allowed to share location data with emergency first responders and for internal research, the FTC said. GM confirmed this, noting it collects data for internal research and development and sometimes shares de-identified, or anonymized data (not associated with specific drivers or vehicles) with select partners to enhance city infrastructure and improve road safety. For instance, data has been shared with the University of Michigan, which used it for <a href=\"https://www.umtri.umich.edu/2025/11/05/new-traffic-signal-reduces-unnecessary-stops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">urban planning. </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM must also establish a way for all U.S. consumers to request a copy of their data and seek its deletion and give them the ability to disable the collection of precise geolocation data from their vehicles. GM says it has already complied with these mandates.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GM says it began overhauling its policies and programs on data collection and privacy in 2024. For instance, the automaker said it has consolidated many of its U.S. privacy statements into a single, simpler statement and expanded its privacy program that allows customers to access and delete their personal information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Federal Trade Commission has formally approved the agreement reached last year with General Motors to address concerns,” an emailed statement from GM reads. “As vehicle connectivity becomes increasingly integral to the driving experience, GM remains committed to protecting customer privacy, maintaining trust, and ensuring customers have a clear understanding of our practices.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The funding values Emversity at around $120 million post-money, sources confirmed to TechCrunch, up from about $60 million in its April 2025 pre-Series A round. Total funding now stands at $46 million.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has been grappling with a widening skills gap, with graduates often entering the workforce without job-ready skills even as key service sectors struggle to hire trained staff. In healthcare, the Indian government says the country has <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2197614\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">about 4.3 million registered nursing personnel</a> and 5,253 nursing institutions producing roughly 387,000 nurses annually, yet recent reports have <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/indias-home-nurses-are-overworked-untrained-and-undervalued-how-to-bridge-the-gap-in-elderly-care/articleshow/120876242.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">continued to flag a shortage</a>. Hospitality, too, has faced a <a href=\"https://etedge-insights.com/industry/travel-and-leisure/hospitalitys-great-talent-gap-why-the-luxury-industry-must-rethink-attraction-retention/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">55% to 60% demand-supply gap</a> for workers, according to industry estimates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity is trying to bridge that gap by integrating employer-designed training programs into university curricula and running skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and placements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two-year-old startup has partnered with 23 universities and colleges across over 40 campuses and focuses on “grey-collar” roles — positions that require hands-on training and credentialing — including nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, as well as hospitality roles such as guest relations and food and beverage service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity has trained about 4,500 learners so far and placed 800 candidates to date, founder and CEO Vivek Sinha (pictured above) said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sinha, who previously served as chief operating officer at Indian edtech startup Unacademy for over three years before starting Emversity in 2023, told TechCrunch he conceived the idea while working on test-preparation courses for entry-level government jobs. He noticed that applicants included engineers, MBAs, and even PhDs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I started speaking to these learners,” he said. “Some of them had paid fees to private colleges and spent 16 to 18 years earning those degrees.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sinha said the gap has widened in recent years and could grow further as automation and new workplace tools change what employers expect from entry-level hires, while demand remains strong in credentialed roles such as healthcare, where hands-on training and staffing ratios still matter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI can cut down the administrative work of a nurse, such as filing patient details or electronic medical records,” Sinha stated. “But AI can’t replace a nurse if you still need one at an ICU for every two beds.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity works with employers such as Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels), and Lemon Tree Hotels to co-design role-specific training modules, which it then helps universities embed into their degree programs. The startup does not charge employers, instead earning revenue through fees paid by partner institutions and through short-term certification programs run at its NSDC-affiliated skill centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup operates with gross margins of about 80% and has kept customer acquisition costs below 10% of revenue by relying largely on organic channels rather than performance marketing, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the startup offers a career counseling platform for high school students that generated more than 350,000 inquiries and accounted for more than 20% of revenue last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the fresh funding, Emversity plans to expand its footprint to more than 200 locations over the next two years and deepen its focus on healthcare and hospitality, while entering new industries such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and manufacturing. The startup is already in advanced discussions with one of India’s top EPC companies to design and roll out role-specific programs this year, and plans to begin manufacturing-focused training next year, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To deliver consistent outcomes across campuses, Emversity combines employer-led curriculum design with hands-on training infrastructure, including simulation labs for clinical roles such as nursing and emergency care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Emversity’s revenue split roughly evenly between its university-embedded training programs and short-term certification courses run through its own skill centers, Sinha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Emversity currently builds talent pipelines for domestic employers, Sinha said the startup sees an opportunity to eventually serve international demand as well, particularly in healthcare, as aging populations in markets such as Japan and Germany look for trained workers. However, he did not disclose the exact timeline for catering to global demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emversity has about 700 employees, including 200 to 250 trainers deployed across its campus network.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Copyleaks, an AI detection and content governance platform, estimated roughly one image was posted each minute on X. A separate <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2Nzc5MDk4NywiZXhwIjoxNzY4Mzk1Nzg3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOEhRS0hLR0lGUE8wMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.3B4JWnmqmXFC3DOqhs11h99g5gNzi4j_poKAHLuWdrY&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sample</a> gathered from January 5 to January 6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. (X and xAI are part of the same company.) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This material…has been used to harass people across the internet,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement. “I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AG’s office will investigate whether and how xAI violated the law. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several laws exist to protect targets of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\">Take It Down Act</a> was signed into a federal law, which criminalizes knowingly distributing nonconsensual intimate images — including deepfakes — and requires platforms like X to remove such content within 48 hours. California also has its own <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/19/governor-newsom-signs-bills-to-crack-down-on-sexually-explicit-deepfakes-require-ai-watermarking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">series of laws</a> that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2024 to crack down on sexually explicit deepfakes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grok began fulfilling user requests on X to produce sexualized photos of women and children toward the end of the year. The trend appears to have taken off after certain adult-content creators prompted Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves as a form of marketing, which then led to other users issuing similar prompts. In a number of public cases, including well-known figures like “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown, Grok responded to prompts asking it to alter real photos of real women by changing clothing, body positioning, or physical features in overtly sexual ways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/13/musks-x-stops-bikini-bot-undressing-women/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some reports</a>, xAI has begun implementing safeguards to address the issue. Grok now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/x-restricts-groks-image-generation-to-paying-subscribers-only-after-drawing-the-worlds-ire/\">requires a premium subscription</a> before responding to certain image-generation requests, and even then the image may not be generated. April Kozen, VP of marketing at Copyleaks, told TechCrunch that Grok may fulfill a request in a more generic or toned-down way. They added that Grok appears more permissive with adult content creators. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, these behaviors suggest X is experimenting with multiple mechanisms to reduce or control problematic image generation, though inconsistencies remain,” Kozen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neither xAI nor Musk has publicly addressed the problem head on. A few days after the instances began, Musk appeared to make light of the issue by asking Grok to generate an <a href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/2006546133875876195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2006547579161686289%7Ctwgr%5Ecd342afac0c746785e362fda4ec482da7d71b4d4%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mandatory.com%2Fnews%2F1708977-elon-musk-bikini-grok-ai-image\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">image of himself in a bikini</a>. On January 3, <a href=\"https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">X’s safety account</a> said the company takes “action against illegal content on X, including [CSAM],” without specifically addressing Grok’s apparent lack of safeguards or the creation of sexualized manipulated imagery involving women. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The positioning mirrors what Musk posted today, emphasizing illegality and user behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk wrote he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” That statement doesn’t deny the existence of bikini pics or sexualized edits more broadly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School and former litigator, told TechCrunch that Musk likely narrowly focused on CSAM because the penalties for creating or distributing synthetic sexualized imagery of children are greater. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For example, in the United States, the distributor or threatened distributor of CSAM can face up to three years imprisonment under the Take It Down Act, compared to two for nonconsensual adult sexual imagery,” Goodyear said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that the “bigger point” is Musk’s attempt to draw attention to problematic user content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user request,” Musk wrote in his post. “When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taken together, the post characterizes these incidents as uncommon, attributes them to user requests or adversarial prompting, and presents them as technical issues that can be solved through fixes. It stops short of acknowledging any shortcomings in Grok’s underlying safety design. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Regulators may consider, with attention to free speech protections, requiring proactive measures by AI developers to prevent such content,” Goodyear said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI to ask how many times it caught instances of nonconsensual sexually manipulated images of women and children, what guardrails specifically changed, and whether the company notified regulators of the issue. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The California AG isn’t the only regulator to try to hold xAI accountable for the issue. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">Indonesia and Malaysia</a> have both temporarily blocked access to Grok; India has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/india-orders-musks-x-to-fix-grok-over-obscene-ai-content/\">demanded that X</a> make immediate technical and procedural changes to Grok; the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-commission-has-ordered-x-retain-all-grok-documents-until-end-2026-2026-01-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">European Commission ordered</a> xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot, a precursor to opening a new investigation; and the U.K.’s online safety watchdog <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/ofcom-launches-investigation-into-x-over-grok-sexualised-imagery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ofcom opened a formal investigation</a> under the U.K.’s Online Safety Act. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI has come under fire for Grok’s sexualized imagery before. As AG Bonta pointed out in a statement, Grok includes a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/grok-imagine-xais-new-ai-image-and-video-generator-lets-you-make-nsfw-content/\">“spicy mode”</a> to generate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/of-course-groks-ai-companions-want-to-have-sex-and-burn-down-schools/\">explicit content</a>. In October, an update made it even easier to jailbreak what little safety guidelines there were, resulting in many users creating hardcore pornography with Grok, as well as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">graphic and violent sexual images</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the more pornographic images that Grok has produced have been of AI-generated people — something that many might still find ethically dubious but perhaps less harmful to the individuals in the images and videos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people’s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,” Copyleaks co-founder and CEO Alon Yamin said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “From Sora to Grok, we are seeing a rapid rise in AI capabilities for manipulated media. To that end, detection and governance are needed now more than ever to help prevent misuse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The chipmaker will deliver 750 megawatts of compute to the AI giant starting this year and continuing through the year 2028, <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/openai-partners-with-cerebras-to-bring-high-speed-inference-to-the-mainstream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cerebras said</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal is worth over $10 billion, a source familiar with the details told TechCrunch. Reuters also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-buy-compute-capacity-startup-cerebras-around-10-billion-wsj-reports-2026-01-14/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> the deal size.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both companies said that the deal is about delivering faster outputs for OpenAI’s customers. In <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/cerebras-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a>, OpenAI said these systems would speed responses that currently require more time to process. Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, said just as “broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras has been around for <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over a decade</a> but its star has risen significantly since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and the AI boom that followed. The company claims its systems, built with its chips designed for AI use, are faster than GPU-based systems (such as Nvidia’s offerings).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras filed for an IPO in 2024 but since then has pushed it back a number of times. In the meantime, the company has continued to <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/press-release/series-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raise large amounts of money</a>. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chipmaker-cerebras-talks-raise-1-billion-22-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it was reported</a> that the company was in talks to raise another billion dollars at a $22 billion valuation. It’s also worth noting that OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, is already <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an investor in the company</a> and that OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/openai-at-one-point-considered-acquiring-ai-chip-startup-cerebras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">once considered acquiring it</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads,” said Sachin Katti of OpenAI in the company’s post. “Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Davidson already has two comedy specials on the service that have performed well for the streamer. Meanwhile, Irvin was a big focus in Netflix’s documentary series “America’s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Davidson’s show will feature candid, behind-the-scenes conversations with friends from his own garage, airing every Friday, while Irvin’s show will deliver in-depth sports news, analysis, and commentary twice a week, joined by notable guest co-hosts like former NFL All-Pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These originals will join Netflix’s growing slate of video podcasts, alongside licensed titles from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/netflix-doubles-down-on-video-podcasts-with-iheartmedia-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iHeartMedia</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a>, and Barstool Sports such as Dear Chelsea, My Favorite Murder, and The Ringer. Notably, as part of these licensing agreements, these shows aren’t available in full on YouTube. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wednesday’s news comes at a time when Netflix is increasingly trying to challenge YouTube’s dominance in the podcast space, with viewers watching <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcasts-living-room-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 700 million hours</a> of podcasts per month on living room devices in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Netflix is still in the early stages of developing its podcast library. With millions of podcasts available across YouTube, Spotify, and other rival platforms, the vast array of choices poses a significant challenge for Netflix. If the company wants to grab a decent chunk of that audience, it’s got a lot of catching up to do.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix’s chief technology officer, Elizabeth Stone, addressed the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/netflix-cto-says-more-vertical-video-experiments-are-coming-but-streamer-is-not-competing-with-tiktok/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">podcast ambitions</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in October, discussing how the expansion into video podcasts represents part of a broader strategy to explore new interactive content types.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

app economy. In 2025, consumers spent $72.2 billion on mobile games, accounting for about 46% of all spending within mobile apps. While that figure is up 10% year-over-year, spending on non-game mobile apps also increased. In fact, non-game app spending is up 33.9% year-over-year and reached $82.6 billion in 2025, Appfigures said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While consumers may not like that nearly every app now has in-app purchases or a subscription model built in, this has offered a more sustainable path for app developers.

This includes subscription management platform RevenueCat, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/revenuecat-raises-50m-as-it-expands-beyond-mobile-app-monetization/\">which raised a $50 million Series C</a> this past year, and <a href=\"https://www.appcharge.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Appcharge</a>, a startup helping mobile games <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/appcharge-raises-26m-to-help-gaming-apps-cut-out-apple-and-google-from-virtual-goods-revenues/\">improve</a> their monetization, which announced a <a href=\"https://www.appcharge.com/blog/announcing-our-58-m-series-b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$58 million Series B</a> back in August.

This year’s figure of 106.9 billion installs was down from 109.8 billion in 2024, and follows slowed download growth between 2023 and 2024, when installs were down 3.3%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mobile game downloads saw a larger decline this year. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, down 8.6% year-over-year, after a 6.6% decline from 2023 to 2024. Non-game app downloads were essentially flat — they only saw a slight increase of 1.1% year-over-year, reaching 67.4 billion. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div

After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/69630fa9-02d4-8012-8ef2-84c443c04922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chain of thought</a> is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Legendre’s formula</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bertrand’s postulate</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David_theorem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Star of David theorum</a>. Eventually, the model found <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/138209/product-of-central-binomial-coefficients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Math Overflow post from 2013</a>, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Somani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over 1,000 conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are <a href=\"https://www.erdosproblems.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">maintained online</a>. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve</a> — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress <a href=\"https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contributions-to-Erd%C5%91s-problems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on his GitHub page</a>, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115891257393270694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">On Mastodon</a>, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another driving force is a recent shift toward formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, the IPO research firm <a href=\"https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/116132/Advertising-mobile-app-software-Liftoff-Mobile-files-for-an-estimated-$400-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Renaissance Capital</a> reports the whisper number at $400 million, meaning that’s what the street thinks the company hopes to raise.<br><br>The company offers a platform that helps mobile app developers market their apps and was formed in 2021 through a merger of Liftoff and Vungle. Blackstone acquired the majority of its shares at the time and the finance giant also appointed new leadership, meaning it is no longer a founder-run company. After the offering, Blackstone will remain the majority shareholder, according to the S-1 filing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another interesting tidbit: This listing, despite its relatively small expected size, has an unusually large number of bankers underwriting it. The offering has three joint lead bankers (Goldman, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley) and another 12 banks assisting to sell, plus three other financial institutions, including Blackstone, involved. Whew! That could either be a sign of strong investor interest or the need to spread risk across many institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liftoff claims 140,000 apps use its services. It says it had 2025 revenues of over $519 million and a net loss of just over $48 million. The company also says it is carrying over $1.85 billion in debt.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

At the same time, social platforms will need a new set of tools to ensure they’re not taken over by AI bots posing as people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We obviously don’t want to force everyone down some kind of crazy KYC process,” said Rose in an interview with TechCrunch, referring to the “know your customer” verification process used by financial institutions to confirm someone’s identity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, he proposes that Digg should pick up “little signals of trust along the way and bundle them all together into something that’s meaningful.”  </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082687\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-darkMode.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Digg</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of simply offering verification checkmarks to designate trust, Digg will try out new technologies, like using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (cryptographic methods that verify information without revealing the underlying data) to verify the people using its platform. It could also do other things, like require that people who join a product-focused community verify they actually own or use the product being discussed there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an example, a community for Oura ring owners could verify that everyone who posts has proven they own one of the smart rings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, Rose suggests Digg could use signals acquired from mobile devices to help verify members — for instance, the app could identify when Digg users attended a meetup in the same location.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think there’s going to be any one silver bullet here,” said Rose. “It’s just going to be us saying … here’s a platter of things that you can add together to create trust.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before today’s public beta launch, the site offered 21 more generalized communities like gaming, technology, and entertainment, and was open to 67,000 users on an invite-only basis. Now anyone will be able to join and start their own communities on nearly any topic, no matter how niche — a top request from beta testers. The community managers (i.e., moderators) for these individual forums will be able to set their own rules, and their moderation logs will be shared publicly, so members can see what decisions are being made.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082759\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-desktop-mobile-darkMode.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Digg</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The site has also been redesigned since its private beta, now offering a new sidebar where you can pin your favorite communities and a main feed optimized for visual elements. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, communities will only have one manager, but that will change in time, as the company adds more features, including those to customize the look and feel and functionality of individual communities with integrations and other tools. For instance, a movie reviews community could include scores from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Letterboxd</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We kind of opted for … let’s just keep building this plane as we fly it,” explained Digg CEO Justin Mezzell. “That means that it’s going to be very lightweight, and we’re just going to be aggressively shipping every week and just giving them new features as we go,” he added.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082686\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/digg-communities-2-lightMode.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Digg</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also plans to listen to its community managers about what they need and build accordingly, and it has brought on some Reddit moderators as advisers. Although Reddit was built on the back of volunteer moderators, Digg aims to find a model that improves the moderator experience. Plans on this front haven’t been fleshed out yet, however, but Mezzell said it “has to be a conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to figure out a way to make this an equitable experience for everybody who’s actually building Digg into what it needs to become,” he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the team is considering shifting its AI-created podcast about the interesting stories surfacing on Digg into a human-hosted version, as users have been requesting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rose told TechCrunch that the current team is small, giving them “years of runway” to find product-market fit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The beautiful thing about this launch is we’re finally at the place with Digg where it’s just that the foundational stuff is done, and now we can really start having fun,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Note: The rollout should begin around 4 PM ET</em>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings.

AI music now sounds real enough that it can be difficult to decipher how it was made.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one high-profile example, Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&amp;B song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">How Was I Supposed To Know</a>.” Her AI “persona,” Xania Monet, received multiple bids for record deals before signing with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The legality of AI-generated music is up in the air. Suno is currently facing <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/labels-fire-back-at-sunos-attempt-to-dismiss-youtube-stream-ripping-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lawsuits</a> from major labels Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, which allege the company trained its AI on copyrighted material from the labels.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This hasn’t deterred Silicon Valley, though. Suno raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/legally-embattled-ai-music-startup-suno-raises-at-2-45b-valuation-on-200m-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$250 million Series C</a> round in November, which valued the company at $2.4 billion. While the raise was led by Menlo Ventures, Suno saw participation from Hallwood Media, the company backing Xania Monet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The legal outlook doesn’t look good for artists. In a recent lawsuit, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a judge ruled</a> that Anthropic could use copyrighted books that it downloaded illegally to train its AI. What was illegal, the judge said, was that Anthropic pirated the books that it fed into its AI models. The company got a $1.5 billion slap on the wrist, which isn’t very significant for a company that’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">valued</a> at $183 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike Spotify or Apple Music, Bandcamp doesn’t pay artists per stream. Instead, Bandcamp allows artists to sell their music digitally alongside physical products like merch and CDs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bandcamp only makes money from its cut of artists’ sales — but even if it presents itself as an artist-first distributor, a tech company is still a tech company, and the bottom line matters. Looking at Bandcamp’s move optimistically, perhaps the company is confirming what artists hope to be true: No one is actually spending money to buy AI-generated music, at least not on Bandcamp.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Type One is also in the midst of raising a $250 million Series B at a $900 million pre-money valuation, according to sources and later confirmed by the company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other energy startups, Type One has benefited from a surge in demand from data centers and the broader electrification of the economy. Data centers are expected to use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nearly three times more electricity</a> by 2035, while overall electricity demand is forecast to grow by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/global-electricity-demand-expected-to-grow-4-annually-through-2027/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">4% annually</a> through next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion power could deliver gigawatts’ worth of nearly limitless clean power. The reactors work by fusing atoms, which release tremendous amounts of heat and energy in the process. Power plants harvest that heat to spin turbines, similar to today’s fossil fuel facilities, but without the pollution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike fission, fusion reactors don’t produce significant amounts of radioactive waste. They also don’t pose a risk of catastrophic meltdowns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are two main approaches to fusion power: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. In the former, magnets compress and control plasma, the superheated particles that ultimately fuse into new atoms. In the latter, fuel pellets are compressed until they fuse, most often using lasers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Type One will employ magnetic confinement, and the design is what’s known as a stellarator. In a stellarator, magnets are arranged in a doughnut shape that’s twisted and turned according to the demands of the plasma. Previously built stellarators have been able to control plasma for long periods of time, though none have been built yet with the intention of producing power.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Type One signed deals with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to place the startup’s first commercial power plant at the site of the former Bull Run Fossil Plant, a coal-fired power plant that was retired in 2023. Infinity Two, as the power plant is called, is expected to generate 350 megawatts of electricity and could come online in the mid-2030s, the company has said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike many other startups, Type One isn’t planning to build the power plants or reactors itself and sell the power. Instead, the company will sell key technology to the TVA and power providers, who will build, own, and operate the plants. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Type One had previously raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/fusion-startup-type-one-fundraising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$29 million seed round</a> in 2023 that was extended to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/bill-gates-backed-type-one-energy-lands-massive-seed-extension-to-commercialize-fusion-power/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a total of $82.5 million</a> in 2024.

Google says this means Gemini understands context without being told where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant notes that this beta experience, called Personal Intelligence, is off by default, as users have the option to choose if and when they want to connect their Google apps to Gemini. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and YouTube history. If you do decide to connect your apps, Gemini will only use Personal Intelligence when it determines that doing so will be helpful, Google says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Personal Intelligence has two core strengths: reasoning across complex sources and retrieving specific details from, say, an email or photo to answer your question,” wrote Josh Woodward, VP, Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio, in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/personal-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “It often combines these, working across text, photos and video to provide uniquely tailored answers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Woodward shared an example of when he was standing in line at a tire shop and didn’t remember his car’s tire size. While most AI chatbots can determine a car’s tire size, Woodward says Gemini can go further by offering personalized responses. In his case, Gemini suggested all-weather tires after identifying family road trip photos in Google Photos. Woodward also said he forgot his license plate number, but Gemini was able to pull the number from a picture in Photos. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082592\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve also been getting excellent tips for books, shows, clothes and travel,” Woodward wrote. “Just this week, it’s been exceptional for planning our upcoming spring break. By analyzing our family’s interests and past trips in Gmail and Photos, it skipped the tourist traps. Instead, it suggested an overnight train journey and specific board games we could play along the way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says it has guardrails for sensitive topics, as Gemini will avoid making proactive assumptions about sensitive data like health. However, the tech giant also notes that Gemini will discuss this data if you ask it to. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Gemini doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts in Gemini and the model’s responses. In the examples above, the photos of the road trip, the license plate picture in Photos, and the emails in Gmail are not directly used to train the model. They are only referenced to generate a response, Google says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Personal Intelligence is rolling out to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Google plans to expand the feature to more countries and Gemini’s free tier. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google provided a list of example prompts to try, including “Help me plan my weekend in [city i.e. New York] based on things I like to do,” “Recommend some documentaries based on what I’ve been curious about,” or “Based on my delivery and grocery receipts in Gmail, Search history, and YouTube watch history, recommend 5 YouTube channels that match my cooking style or meal prep vibe.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At the same time, cyber defenders are also turning to the technology to fight back. <a href=\"https://depthfirst.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Depthfirst</a>, a security startup positioning itself at the forefront of this AI-powered defense, announced Wednesday that it had raised $40 million in a Series A round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in October 2024, the company raised the round from Accel Partners, which led the investment, with participation from SV Angel, Mantis VC, and Alt Capital.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Depthfirst offers a platform called General Security Intelligence, an AI-native suite that helps companies scan and analyze their codebases and workflows for signs of trouble. The company says that the platform also allows companies to protect themselves from credential exposures and to monitor threats to their open source and third-party components.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use the new capital to hire additional staff for applied research and engineering, as well as product and sales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve entered an era where software is written faster than it can be secured,” said Qasim Mithani, the company’s co-founder and CEO, as part of the announcement. Mithani, who previously worked for Databricks and Amazon, added that automation has changed how bad actors execute their attacks. “AI has already changed how attackers work. Defense has to evolve just as fundamentally.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s leadership comes with backgrounds in both AI and security.

The researchers say they have seen elaborate hacks targeting logistics companies to hijack and redirect large amounts of their customers’ products into the hands of criminals, in what has become an alarming collusion between hackers and real-life organized crime gangs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-10/hijackers-stole-a-delivery-truck-after-hack-spotlighting-uptick-in-cargo-theft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delivery truck of stolen vapes</a> here, a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/12/29/lobster-stolen-massachusetts-warehouse/87950372007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suspected lobster heist</a> there.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One little-known and critical U.S. shipping tech company has spent the last few months patching its own systems following the discovery of a raft of simple vulnerabilities, which inadvertently left the doors to its shipping platform wide open to anyone on the internet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is Bluspark Global, a New York-based firm whose shipping and supply chain platform, Bluvoyix, allows hundreds of big companies to transport their products and track their cargo as it travels across the globe. While Bluspark may not be a household name, the company helps to power a large slice of worldwide freight shipments, including retail giants, grocery stores, furniture makers, and more. The company’s software is also used by several other companies affiliated with Bluspark.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluspark told TechCrunch this week that its security issues are now resolved. The company fixed five flaws in its platform, including the use of plaintext passwords by employees and customers, and the ability to remotely access and interact with Bluvoyix’s shipping software. The flaws exposed access to all of the customer’s data, including their shipment records, dating back decades. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But for security researcher Eaton Zveare, who uncovered the vulnerabilities in Bluspark’s systems back in October, alerting the company to the security flaws took longer than the discovery of the bugs themselves — since Bluspark had no discernable way to contact it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a now-published <a href=\"https://eaton-works.com/2026/01/14/bluspark-bluvoyix-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>, Zveare said he submitted details of the five flaws in Bluspark’s platform to the <a href=\"https://maritimehackingvillage.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Maritime Hacking Village</a>, a nonprofit that works to secure maritime space and, as with this case, helps researchers to notify companies working in the maritime industry of active security flaws. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weeks later, and following multiple emails, voicemails, and LinkedIn messages, the company had not responded to Zveare. All the while, the flaws could still be exploited by anyone on the internet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a last resort, Zveare contacted TechCrunch in an effort to get the issues flagged. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch sent emails to Bluspark CEO Ken O’Brien and the company’s senior leadership alerting them to a security lapse, but did not receive a response. TechCrunch later emailed a Bluspark customer, a U.S. publicly traded retail company, to alert them of the upstream security lapse, but we also did not hear back.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the third time TechCrunch emailed Bluspark’s CEO, we included a partial copy of his password to demonstrate the seriousness of the security lapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A couple of hours later, TechCrunch received a response — from a law firm representing Bluspark. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-plaintext-passwords-and-an-unauthenticated-api\">Plaintext passwords and an unauthenticated API</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his blog post, Zveare explained he initially discovered the vulnerabilities after visiting the website of a Bluspark customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare wrote that the customer’s website had a contact form that allowed prospective customers to make inquiries. By viewing the web page source code with his browser’s built-in tools, Zveare noticed the form would send the customer’s message through Bluspark’s servers via its API. (An API allows two or more connected systems to communicate with each other over the internet; in this case, a website contact form and the Bluspark customer’s inbox.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the email-sending code was embedded in the web page itself, this meant it was possible for anyone to modify the code and abuse this form to <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">send malicious emails</a>, such as phishing lures, originating from a real Bluspark customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare pasted the API’s web address into his browser, which loaded a page containing the API’s auto-generated documentation. This web page was a <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">master list</a> of all the actions that can be performed with the company’s API, such as requesting a list of users who have access to Bluspark’s platforms, as well as creating new user accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The API documentation page also had a feature allowing anyone the ability to “test” the API by submitting commands to retrieve data from Bluspark’s servers as a logged-in user. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare found that the API, despite the page claiming that it required authentication to use, <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22236\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">did not need a password</a> or any credentials to return sensitive information from Bluspark’s servers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using only the list of API commands, Zveare was able to retrieve reams of user account records of employees and customers who use Bluspark’s platform, entirely unauthenticated. This included usernames and passwords, which were <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visible in plaintext</a> and not encrypted — including an account associated with the platform’s administrator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the admin’s username and password in hand, an attacker could have logged into this account and run amok. As a good-faith security researcher, Zveare could not use the credentials, as using someone else’s password without their permission is unlawful. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the API documentation listed a command that allowed anyone to <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22238\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">create a new user</a> with administrator access, Zveare went ahead and did just that, and got unrestricted access to its Bluvoyix supply chain platform. Zveare said the administrator’s level of access allowed the viewing of customer data as far back as 2007.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare found that once logged in with this newly created user, each API request was wrapped in a user-specific token, which was meant to ensure the user was in fact allowed to access a portal page each time they clicked on a link. But the token was not necessary to complete the command, allowing Zveare to send requests without the token altogether, further confirming that the API was unauthenticated. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bugs-fixed-company-plans-new-security-policy\">Bugs fixed, company plans new security policy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After establishing contact with Bluspark’s law firm, Zveare gave TechCrunch permission to share a copy of his vulnerability report with its representatives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Days later, the law firm said Bluspark had remediated most of the flaws and was working to retain a third-party company for an independent assessment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare’s efforts to disclose the bugs highlight a common problem in the cybersecurity world. Companies oftentimes do not provide a way, such as a publicly listed email address, to alert them about security vulnerabilities. As such, this can make it challenging for security researchers to publicly reveal security flaws that remain active, out of concerns that disclosing details could put users’ data at risk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ming Lee, an attorney representing Bluspark, told TechCrunch on Tuesday the company is “confident in the steps taken to mitigate potential risk arising from the researcher’s findings,” but would not comment on specifics of the vulnerabilities or their fixes; say which third-party assessment company it retained, if any; or comment on its specific security practices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked by TechCrunch, Bluspark would not say if it was able to ascertain if any of its customer shipments had been manipulated by someone maliciously exploiting the bugs. Lee said there was “no indication of customer impact or malicious activity attributable to the issues identified by the researcher.” Bluspark would not say what evidence it had to reach that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lee said Bluspark was planning to introduce a disclosure program, allowing outside security researchers to report bugs and flaws to the company, but that its discussions were still underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluspark CEO Ken O’Brien did not provide comment for this article.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>To securely contact this reporter, you can reach out using Signal via the username: zackwhittaker.1337</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Going forward, the only way to access the feature will be through a monthly subscription.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change represents a major break from how Tesla has sold access to the advanced driver assistance suite over the years. It’s also a decision that could have an impact on Tesla’s bottom line, Musk’s ability to unlock the full value of his $1 trillion pay package, and the company’s ever-swirling legal troubles. And it comes as many other global automakers are making progress on their own advanced driver assistance systems in hopes of competing with Tesla. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has sold access to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software suite — which still does not make a car completely autonomous, and requires human supervision — at various price points over the years. The upfront price peaked at $15,000 in 2022, though more recently the company has been charging customers $8,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla started offering access to the software via a $199-per-month <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">subscription in 2021</a>, and it dropped that price to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/tesla-drops-fsd-price-to-99-per-month-in-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">just $99-per-month in 2024</a>. Musk often encouraged customers to pay the upfront price, though, as he claimed the cost of FSD would increase dramatically as Tesla added to its capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But on Wednesday, Musk wrote in a post on X that Tesla will stop selling FSD outright starting on February 14. He didn’t say whether Tesla plans to change the pricing structure for the subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also did not offer an explanation for the change, but there are a few possible reasons. Musk and other Tesla executives have spoken publicly about how the adoption rate is lower than they had hoped. In October 2025, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-full-self-driving-sales-customers-pay-fsd-2025-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> only 12% of all Tesla customers have paid for FSD. Shifting to a subscription-only model with a lower upfront cost could help boost those numbers, especially during a first quarter that is expected to be rough for Tesla.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boosting subscriptions would also get Musk closer to fulfilling one of the key “product goals” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/06/musks-1t-pay-package-is-full-of-watered-down-versions-of-his-own-broken-promises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">required for him to receive the full payout</a> of his new $1 trillion pay package. The company has tasked him with, among other things, reaching “10 million active FSD subscriptions” (measured daily over a three-month period) before late 2035.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moving to a subscription-only model could also be a legal hedge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For a decade, Musk and Tesla promoted the idea that customers were buying cars that had all the hardware required to become autonomous vehicles, and that all the company needed to do was improve the software. But that was not true: Tesla has had to make a number of upgrades inside its vehicles in the years since, and Musk himself has said that a huge portion of existing owners (those with so-called “Hardware 3” vehicles) would likely need new hardware in their cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FSD was sold under this same promise. Customers who bought the software outright would eventually get a software update that would make their cars full autonomous. Tesla has still not fulfilled that promise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla currently faces all kinds of legal trouble related to these unmet promises. In December, a judge ruled that the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-marketing-for-autopilot-and-full-self-driving-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">engaged in deceptive marketing</a> around FSD (and its less-capable system, Autopilot) and ordered the California DMV (which brought the case) to suspend Tesla’s manufacturing and dealer licenses in the state for 30 days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV stayed the order and gave Tesla at least 60 days to comply by changing the names of those products, or ship software that delivers on the promise. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla also faces a range of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/tesla-drivers-can-pursue-class-action-over-self-driving-claims-judge-rules-2025-08-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">class action</a> lawsuits over the claims it made about the future autonomous capabilities of its vehicles. By removing the option to buy FSD outright, the company could be capping any potential liabilities in those lawsuits should they proceed to trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s FSD is still regarded as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-for-traffic-safety-violations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most capable driver-assistance software</a> on the market in the U.S. But the company’s success hasn’t stopped competitors from trying to develop their own systems. Rivian recently detailed its own efforts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">release FSD-like driver assistance software</a>, starting with a major <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/rivian-rolls-out-new-universal-hands-free-driving-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">geographic expansion</a> to its hands-free driving feature. Ford and General Motors have their own hands-free systems. And the many rival automakers Tesla competes with in China have been developing their own solutions, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/why-chinas-auto-tech-giants-threaten-teslas-self-driving-future-2025-06-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some even offering their driver assistance features as a standard option</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
