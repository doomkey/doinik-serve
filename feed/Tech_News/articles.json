Following the launch of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/kindle-colorsoft-review-a-subtle-approach-to-color/\">Kindle Colorsoft</a> last year, the retailer on Thursday introduced a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KindleColorsoft?ref=dmm_inf_erd_sb_base_aa_Q325\">lower-cost version</a> of the normally $279.99 device. The new device offers a $30 discount for 16GB of storage instead of 32GB, bringing the cost down to $249.99. A <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindlecolorsoftkids?ref=dmm_inf_erd_sb_kke_aa_Q325\">kids edition</a> is also now available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The original <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/kindle-color-specs-price-announce\">7-inch Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a> was designed to bring a more engaging visual experience to the popular Kindle e-reader, ideal for digitally browsing comics and other graphic novels or highlighting in different colors. The device offered an adjustable, glare-free display with up to eight weeks of battery life, and it even allows users to invert the black text and white background of pages for those who prefer a dark mode-like experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new 16GB model also features the high-contrast Colorsoft display of the original, the adjustable warm light, battery life, fast page turns, and more. Plus, it includes three months of Kindle Unlimited, the subscription offering access to over 4 million e-books.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it won’t include the auto-adjusting front light, wireless charging, or the larger storage space of the Signature Edition. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030974\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img-3337.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindlecolorsoftkids?ref=dmm_inf_erd_sb_kke_aa_Q325\">Kindle Colorsoft Kids</a> ships with an illustrated cover, a two-year guarantee, and a year of the Amazon Kids+ subscription offering access to books, games, videos, apps, and more.

His work was impressive enough that Turso’s CEO, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/glommer/\">Glauber Costa</a>, quickly offered him a job. That was also when Costa realized that Thorpe is anything but an ordinary programmer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I checked his GitHub profile, and he mentions the fact that he is incarcerated,” Costa told TechCrunch. “It’s a story I’ve never seen before.”<br><br>It’s true: Thorpe is serving his 11th year in prison for drug-related crimes. Still, he has worked full-time from his cell at a venture-funded, San Fransisco-based startup since May.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I reached out to him in January, just to understand and get to know him,” Costa said. “Since then, I’ve had deep conversations with him about his change of heart that led him to be in the position where he is today […] Knowing his story increased our respect for him personally.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thorpe is part of an experimental program in the Maine state prison system that allows incarcerated people to work remote jobs from custody. Though unconventional, these opportunities have proven immensely rehabilitative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kicked out of his home as a teenager, Thorpe resorted to selling drugs that he bought from the dark web, and ended up in prison by the time he was 20. He got out a few years later, but with no money to his name and nowhere safe to live, he was arrested again 14 months later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was a complete idiot,” Thorpe told TechCrunch over a video call from prison. “I had given up on my life, completely written it off, and just accepted that this was my life and just had no hope.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-second-chances\">Second chances</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thorpe had given up, but chance had different plans. He was transferred from a prison in New Hampshire to the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Maine just before the pandemic struck, allowing him to rekindle hope anew.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I came to Maine, it was completely different,” he reminisced. “COVID happened right after I came up here, and it just gave me a chance — there was no one around that I felt like I had to act or prove myself to. It was just me. I actually felt like maybe it’s not over; maybe I could actually end up having a normal life. I had this kind of epiphany: ‘I’m going to make something of myself.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the Mountain View prison, Thorpe earned his degree remotely from the University of Maine at Augusta. Around the same time, Colby College wanted to hire one of its incarcerated graduate students to be an adjunct professor. It was an unconventional proposal, but the Maine Department of Corrections Commissioner, Randall Liberty, felt like taking a risk.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After consideration, I allowed that to happen, and over time, it’s been very successful,” Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. “His students are able to come visit him at the prison, and he can tour them around. It provides for a real diversity of opinions, thoughts, and backgrounds. It makes for a rich environment to learn.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?w=526\" alt=\"Preston Thorpe\" class=\"wp-image-3030954\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=300,271 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=430,389 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=414,375 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turso_profile_4-1.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Preston Thorpe</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Preston Thorpe</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, about 30 inmates, counting Thorpe, are employed while living in the Earned Living Unit, a less restrictive prison facility for inmates who have exhibited a long track record of good behavior. All inmates with remote jobs surrender 10% of their pay to the state, plus any other payments that may be required for restitution, legal fees, or child support.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Maine has been a real groundbreaker in this area,” Haley Shoaf, co-executive director of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://unlockedlabs.org/\">Unlocked Labs</a>, told TechCrunch. Unlocked Labs, where Thorpe worked prior to Turso, hires incarcerated and formerly incarcerated engineers to make educational software for use in prisons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Maine] put all this infrastructure in place during COVID to allow for remote education, and then once that infrastructure was in place, all of a sudden, it expanded the amount of opportunities people could take advantage of,” Shoaf said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rehabilitation-done-right\">Rehabilitation done right</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commissioner Liberty has worked in law enforcement for 43 years, but it was only after he served in Iraq that his approach to rehabilitation began to shift.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I came back, it gave me a heightened sense of understanding post-traumatic stress and trauma, and all of that plays into corrections,” Commissioner Liberty told TechCrunch. “I began to see the detrimental effects of just the trauma of incarceration, of segregation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While he was the warden of the Maine State Prison – the same prison where he visited his father when he was a child – Commissioner Liberty began implementing programs that address the root causes of crime: substance use disorders, untreated mental health issues, educational deficits, and the like.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have to be able to explain this to people on the right and the left,” Commissioner Liberty said. “When they hear that Preston is making the kind of money he makes, their jaw drops. And I say to them, ‘If you truly care about making the community safer, if you care about being fiscally responsible, if you care about victims and survivors in the community, this is the way to make them whole.’”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The United States criminal justice system is plagued by recidivism, or former prisoners’ return to custody after they have been released. Repeat offending creates a financial burden on the state and its taxpayers. But Commissioner Liberty has the data to show it’s well worth the effort and investment to expand access to education and addiction treatment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s very short-sighted, ridiculous to lock them up and release them more traumatized than when they arrived, right?” Commissioner Liberty said. “Many states have 60% return to custody rates. In Maine, we hover between 21% to 23% for males; women return at a rate of 9%. And if you attend college classes in Maine, you come back at a rate of 0.05% – you don’t come back at all.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commissioner Liberty has also found that under his purview, Maine prisons have become less violent. Last year, a maximum security prison in Maine saw only 7 assaults on prison staff, a dramatic improvement from 87 assaults in 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you treat people like people, they become the best version of themselves,” Shoaf said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thorpe himself is evidence that Commissioner Liberty’s toils are proving successful. The software engineer takes full responsibility for his criminal history, but he feels like a changed man.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s like waking up from a dream, me from five years ago,” Thorpe said. “All the memories I have of the streets and why I came to prison, it doesn’t even feel like it happened to me. It feels like it happened to someone else.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the last three years, Thorpe says he has spent most of his waking hours online, learning everything he can about programming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He was doing this partially because he likes it, but also because he saw in this an opportunity to be seen. And he was right,” Costa said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the open source community, where developers often can’t put a face to a Discord or GitHub profile, Thorpe was treated like any other contributor. It was the first time in over a decade that he was able to strike a first impression as himself – a Linux-obsessed engineer who’s interested in relational databases – and not as a criminal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The worst part about prison is that you assume this identity [of a criminal],” Thorpe said. “Letting someone have a career gives you purpose.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In <a href=\"https://www.upguard.com/breaches/leakzone-net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a> shared with TechCrunch ahead of its publication, the researchers said they discovered the database on July 18 and found its data was accessible to anyone with a web browser. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposed database contained more than 22 million records storing the IP address and precise timestamp of when Leak Zone users logged in. The records were dated as recently as June 25, and the database was updating in real-time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the records were not linked to individual users, the data could be used to identify users who logged into Leak Zone without using any anonymization tools. Some of the records, seen by TechCrunch, indicate whether a user is believed to have logged in through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/09/fbi-and-dutch-police-seize-and-shut-down-botnet-of-hacked-routers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a proxy</a>, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/we-are-skeptical-of-vpn-providers-and-you-should-be-too/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a VPN</a>, which can help conceal the user’s real-world location.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leak Zone, which gained popularity in 2020, advertises access to a “vast collection of leaks ranging from breached databases to cracked accounts,” referring to stolen credentials used for logging into a person’s online accounts. The forum also offers a marketplace that explicitly promotes “illegal services,” the site’s guide reads. A page on Leak Zone’s website claims the forum has more than 109,000 users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to UpGuard, 95% of the records in the exposed database relate to Leak Zone user logins. The remaining data reference accounts associated with AccountBot, another site for selling access to compromised accounts used for streaming services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch verified that the exposed database was recording users logging into Leak Zone by creating a new account and logging in to the site. A corresponding record immediately appeared in the exposed database containing our IP address and the timestamp of the exact moment we logged in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not known why the database was publicly exposed. Human error or misconfigurations are often a cause of data exposures, rather than malicious actions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch was unable to contact the Leak Zone administrators for comment as the forum software denied our ability to send them messages. It’s not clear if the Leak Zone administrators are aware of the exposure or if they plan to notify their users about the security lapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The database is no longer online, UpGuard told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In recent years, U.S. and international authorities have increasingly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/fbi-seizes-hacking-forum-breachforums-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">targeted cybercrime forums</a> and websites for their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/us-justice-department-says-cybercrime-forum-allegedly-affected-17-million-americans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">roles in facilitating hacking, identity theft, and other criminal activity</a>.

In the last year, people across the cybersecurity industry have raised concerns about AI slop bug bounty reports, meaning reports that claim to have found vulnerabilities that do not actually exist, because they were created with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/01/what-is-ai-how-does-ai-work/\">large language model</a> that simply made up the vulnerability, and then packaged it into a professional-looking writeup. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People are receiving reports that sound reasonable, they look technically correct. And then you end up digging into them, trying to figure out, ‘oh no, where is this vulnerability?’,” Vlad Ionescu, the co-founder and CTO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.runsybil.com/\">RunSybil</a>, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It turns out it was just a hallucination all along. The technical details were just made up by the LLM,” said Ionescu. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ionescu, who used to work at Meta’s red team tasked with hacking the company from the inside, explained that one of the issues is that LLMs are designed to be helpful and give positive responses. “If you ask it for a report, it’s going to give you a report. And then people will copy and paste these into the bug bounty platforms and overwhelm the platforms themselves, overwhelm the customers, and you get into this frustrating situation,” said Ionescu. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s the problem people are running into, is we’re getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it’s actually just crap,” said Ionescu. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just in the last year, there have been real-world examples of this. Harry Sintonen, a security researcher, revealed that the open source security project Curl received a fake report. “The attacker miscalculated badly,” Sintonen wrote <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@harrysintonen/114455549143577092\">in a post on Mastodon</a>. “Curl can smell AI slop from miles away.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to Sitonen’s post, Benjamin Piouffle of Open Collective, a tech platform for nonprofits, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://framapiaf.org/@Betree/114456180452192212\">said</a> that they have the same problem: that their inbox is “flooded with AI garbage.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One open-source developer, who maintains the CycloneDX project on GitHub, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-rust-cargo/commit/93b19cb4ac96d1b8f51647df2b89ec4359becae1\">pulled their bug bounty down entirely</a> earlier this year after receiving “almost entirely AI slop reports.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The leading bug bounty platforms, which essentially work as intermediaries between bug bounty hackers and companies who are willing to pay and reward them for finding flaws in their products and software, are also seeing a spike in AI-generated reports, TechCrunch has learned. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about how AI is impacting the cybersecurity industry? We’d love to hear from you. From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Michiel Prins, the co-founder and senior director of product management at HackerOne, told TechCrunch that the company has encountered some AI slop. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve also seen a rise in false positives — vulnerabilities that appear real but are generated by LLMs and lack real-world impact,” said Prins. “These low-signal submissions can create noise that undermines the efficiency of security programs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prins added that reports that contain “hallucinated vulnerabilities, vague technical content, or other forms of low-effort noise are treated as spam.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Casey Ellis, the founder of Bugcrowd, said that there are definitely researchers who use AI to find bugs and write the reports that they then submit to the company. Ellis said they are seeing an overall increase of 500 submissions per week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is widely used in most submissions, but it hasn’t yet caused a significant spike in low-quality ‘slop’ reports,” Ellis told TechCrunch. “This’ll probably escalate in the future, but it’s not here yet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellis said that the Bugcrowd team who analyze submissions review the reports manually using established playbooks and workflows, as well as with machine learning and AI “assistance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To see if other companies, including those who run their own bug bounty programs, are also receiving an increase in invalid reports or reports containing non-existent vulnerabilities hallucinated by LLMs, TechCrunch contacted Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Mozilla. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Damiano DeMonte, a spokesperson for Mozilla, which develops the Firefox browser, said that the company has “not seen a substantial increase in invalid or low quality bug reports that would appear to be AI-generated,” and the rejection rate of reports — meaning how many reports get flagged as invalid — has remained steady at 5 or 6 reports per month, or less than 10% of all monthly reports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mozilla’s employees who review bug reports for Firefox don’t use AI to filter reports, as it would likely be difficult to do so without the risk of rejecting a legitimate bug report,” DeMonte said in an email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft and Meta, companies that have both bet heavily on AI, declined to comment. Google did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ionescu predicts that one of the solutions to the problem of rising AI slop will be to keep investing in AI-powered systems that can at least perform a preliminary review and filter submissions for accuracy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, on Tuesday, HackerOne <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hackerone.com/press-release/hackerone-unveils-hai-triage-upgraded-ai-powered-vulnerability-response\">launched</a> Hai Triage, a new triaging system that combines humans and AI. According to HackerOne spokesperson Randy Walker, this new system leveraging “AI security agents to cut through noise, flag duplicates, and prioritize real threats.” Human analysts then step in to validate the bug reports and escalate as needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As hackers increasingly use LLMs and companies rely on AI to triage those reports, it remains to be seen which of the two AIs will prevail.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For companies with a lot of video to analyze, the startup wants to provide a contextual layer, complete with searchable indexing, tagging, segments and aggregation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its co-founder Dr. Shawn Shen was a research scientist at Meta’s Reality Labs while he was pursuing his PhD, and his counterpart Enmin (Ben) Zhou worked at Meta as a machine learning engineer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All top AI companies, such as Google, OpenAI and Meta, are focused on producing end-to-end models. Those capabilities are good, but these models often have limitations around understanding video context beyond one or two hours,” Shen told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But when humans use visual memory, we sift through a large context of data. We were inspired by this and wanted to build a solution to understand video across many hours better,” he said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030893\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg 3400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1200,633 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1280,675 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=900,475 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=800,422 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1536,810 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=2048,1081 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=668,352 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=1169,617 1169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=708,374 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Memories.ai-Screenshot.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Memories.ai</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Towards that goal, the company has now raised $8 million in a seed funding round led by Susa Ventures, and with participation from Samsung Next, Fusion Fund, Crane Ventures, Seedcamp, and Creator Ventures. Shen said the company initially aimed to raise $4 million, but ended up with an oversubscribed round because of investor interest.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Shen is a highly technical founder, and he is obsessed with pushing boundaries of video understanding and intelligence,” said Misha Gordon-Rowe, a partner at Susa Ventures. “Memories.ai can unlock a lot of first-party visual intelligence data with its solution. We felt that there was a gap in the market for long context visual intelligence, which attracted us to invest in the company,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Samsung Next had a slightly different thesis: the investment arm of Samsung sees Memories.ai’s solution being useful for consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One thing we liked about Memories.ai is that it could do a lot of on-device computing. That means you don’t necessarily need to store video data in the cloud. This can unlock better security applications for people who are apprehensive of putting security cameras in their house because of privacy concerns,” said Sam Campbell, a partner at Samsung Next.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Memories.ai says it uses its own tech stack and models to perform analyses. First, it removes noise from videos and passes the output through a compression layer to only store important data. Then there is an indexing layer, which makes the video data searchable (using natural-language queries) with segmentation and tags. There is also an aggregation layer that summarizes data from the index, helping create reports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, the startup caters to two kinds of companies: marketing and security. Marketing companies can use the startup’s tools to look up trends related to their brands on social media, and identify what kind of video they want to make. Memories.ai also provides tools for marketers to create those videos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also working with security companies to help them analyze security footage to determine potentially dangerous actions by people in the videos by reasoning through patterns.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030897\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg 1262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=1200,726 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=430,260 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=720,435 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=900,544 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=800,484 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=668,404 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=620,375 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=1021,617 1021w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=708,428 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-4.18.54PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot by TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, companies working with Memories.ai need to upload their video library to the platform to have it analyze clips. But Shen said that in the future, his clients will be able to create a shared drive and sync content more easily. The plan is to enable customers to ask questions like: “Tell me all about people I interviewed in the last week.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shen envisions an AI assistant that can gain context on a user’s life via their photos or when they activate smart glasses. He also sees the technology playing a role in training humanoid robots to do complex tasks or helping self-driving cars remember different routes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently employs 15 people, and it plans to use the fund to augment its team and improve its search. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Memories.ai is going up against similar startups, like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mem0.ai/\">mem0</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/letta-one-of-uc-berkeleys-most-anticipated-ai-startups-has-just-come-out-of-stealth/\">Letta</a>, which are working on providing a memory layer for AI models, though they offer limited video support at the moment. It also has to contend with companies like TwelveLabs and Google, which have been working on helping AI models understand videos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shen, however, feels his company’s solution is more horizontal, which would let it work with different video models as well.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The tech giant is also rolling out updated price alerts and teased an upcoming feature that will let users explore shoppable outfits and room inspiration using generative imagery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The official launch of the virtual try-on feature comes two months after Google first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-adds-ai-powered-shopping-features-for-discovery-and-easy-check-out/\">began testing it</a>. The feature works by allowing users to upload a photo of themselves to virtually try on a piece of clothing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is launching in the United States today, letting users try on apparel items in Google’s Shopping Graph across Search, Google Shopping, and product results on Google Images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the feature, users need to tap on a product listing or apparel product result and select the “try it on” icon. From there, they need to upload a full-length photo of themselves. They will then be able to see what they might look like wearing the clothing. Users can save looks and share them with friends as well.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Try-on-1.gif?w=320\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3030706\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Google has offered <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/ai-virtual-try-on-google-shopping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">virtual try-on technology before</a>, the earlier features focused on showing items on a diverse range of models’ bodies. With this new feature, the company is letting users try clothes on a virtual version of their own body.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch comes as Google has been investing in the virtual try-on space. Last month, the tech giant launched an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/google-launches-doppl-a-new-app-that-lets-you-visualize-how-an-outfit-might-look-on-you/\">experimental app called Doppl</a> that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that while both the new try-on feature and Doppl are powered by the same generative AI technology, the app is designed for shoppers to go even deeper with virtual try-on to allow them to curate their personal style. Plus, Doppl can create AI-generated videos so users can get a better sense of how the outfit would look on them in real life.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the new price alerts, users can now specify the amount they want to spend on an item.

It will let users do things like get style inspo for a green flowy dress for a garden party or design ideas for a bedroom.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant says its vision match technology will generate a range of visual options for the query and use the 50 billion products in the Shopping Graph to show product listings for visual matches.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Plus, since location sharing on Snap Map is off by default, no one can see your location or receive a Home Safe alert unless you choose to share it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whether you’re heading back from a first date, a crowded concert, or a weekend getaway, Home Safe can offer a close friend or family member peace of mind that you’ve made it home safely,” Snapchat wrote in a blog post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new feature comes two months after Snapchat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/snap-map-reaches-new-milestone-of-400m-monthly-active-users/\">announced that Snap Map</a> now has more than 400 million monthly active users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. Over time, the feature has evolved and now offers ways for users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/03/snapchat-restaurant-recommendations-snap-map/\">discover local hotspots</a> and find things to do.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company claims Review cuts review times by up to 85% while improving quality and accuracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Success hasn’t tempered LegalOn’s ambitions, however. The company now wants to further build out AI agent tools to go along with its software, and recently raised $50 million to do just that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series C funding round is being led by Goldman Sachs’ growth equity fund, and saw participation from existing investor World Innovation Lab (WiL). New investors Mori Hamada &amp; Matsumoto (a law firm in Japan), Mizuho Bank, and Shoko Chukin Bank also invested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a lot of the new cash is being dedicated to developing more AI agent products, the company is also enhancing its go-to-market efforts in the U.S. and U.K., where it says its business has quadrupled over the past year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LegalOn declined to disclose its valuation.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded by two former corporate lawyers, Nozomu Tsunoda and Masataka Ogasawara in 2017, LegalOn aims to address time-consuming tasks before and after the contract review process, such as organizing legal requests and automating contract management. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Daniel Lewis, Global CEO of LegalOn, the company stands out from the hordes of legal tech startups using AI thanks to its foundation in attorney-drafted, expert legal content. That base, he says, makes LegalOn unlike other tools that rely on users to build rules from scratch, or use generic AI models that lack the precision required for legal work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our approach ensures contract reviews are aligned with real legal standards, making the output more accurate, consistent, and practical for legal teams. In addition, we have more than 50 attorney-built playbooks, seamless integration into existing workflows, and our solution works out-of-the-box on day one,” Lewis said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just last week, the startup launched another tool: <a href=\"https://www.legalontech.com/matter-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Matter Management</a> helps legal teams track contract requests, assign owners, connect matters to relevant people and documents, and collaborate with other departments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also struck a non-equity tech partnership with OpenAI, which gives LegalOn access to the ChatGPT maker’s advanced large language models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a technical collaboration,” Lewis explained. “It gives us early access to their latest models, and it positions our engineers to work kind of side-by-side with engineers from OpenAI. So in that regard, it will advance our goal of building cutting-edge [AI] agents using great technology, but being able to ground that in our proprietary legal content and expertise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI revolution is proving to be a massive tailwind for legal tech startups worldwide. In June, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/four-months-after-a-3b-valuation-harvey-ai-grows-to-5b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Harvey AI secured $300 million in Series E funding</a>, pushing its valuation to $5 billion, and last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/clio-raises-900m-at-a-3b-valuation-plans-to-double-down-on-ai-and-fintech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Clio also raised $300 million, reaching a $3 billion valuation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even as generative AI transforms the legal industry, Lewis doesn’t think it will replace lawyers. “The state of the technology isn’t there yet, and replacing lawyers isn’t even our vision,” he said. “Lawyers are still in the driver’s seat. The things AI can’t do perfectly today are, by definition, the things only people can do. And the lawyers who lean into that responsibility — to oversee, to edit, to exercise judgment — are the ones seeing the most extraordinary leverage from AI right now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series C brings LegalOn’s total capital raised to over $200 million. Its investors include SoftBank Vision Fund, HSG (formerly known as Sequoia Capital China), Japanese venture capital firm JAFCO, and MUFG Bank.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For health reasons, he was vegetarian, but he still missed the taste of ground beef. So he’d ask the chef in the cafeteria for a veggie burger that was cooked next to the beef patties. The grease that seeped over made the plant substitute taste that much better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The folks at <a href=\"https://missionbarns.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mission Barns</a> must have overheard our lunchtime conversation. They have developed animal-free, cultured pork fat. The product just received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The stamp of approval allows the startup to sell the fat to consumers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s the first such product to reach the market, and it could unlock a host of fattened-up meat alternatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It really enables anyone, any of our partners who are using our ingredient, to also launch a product into market,” Cecilia Chang, chief business officer at Mission Barns, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scientists have been trying to culture meat for years. The world’s first lab-grown burger hit food critics’ mouths <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-23576143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in 2013</a>, though it cost an estimated $330,000. The costs have come down significantly since then, but a burger made from lab-grown beef still costs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/04/even-after-1-6b-in-vc-money-the-lab-grown-meat-industry-is-facing-massive-issues/\">several times that of a McDonald’s classic</a>. Part of the problem is that muscle cells require something to grow on, whereas most cells cultured today grow in large vats of liquid media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But fat isn’t as picky, making it easier to grow at a cost that consumers can swallow. And when it comes to flavor, it packs a punch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To grow the fat, Mission Barns first takes a small sample, like a biopsy, from a living pig. It then introduces it into a bioreactor containing a growth media. Because fat floats, the startup had to develop its own bioreactor to ensure the cells were evenly distributed throughout the media. If they clumped at the top, they wouldn’t get access to enough food to grow properly.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mission Barns’ first products are bacon, meatball, and sausage alternatives made using pea protein paired with its cultured pork fat. The startup is also supplying other companies with its fat to incorporate into their own recipes. In the long run, Chang said, selling to other food manufacturers will be its main business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pea protein is a common ingredient among alternative meats, but Chang said that Mission Barns’ recipe differs. “Because the fat gives you so much flavor, you’re actually taking out some of the most expensive ingredients in an alternative protein product, the artificial flavorings,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chang also said that, perhaps incongruously, Mission Barns’ cultured pork fat should allow for healthier alternative meats. Recipes won’t need as much salt to mask the pea protein taste, and the company can tweak what the cells eat, boosting omega-3 fats, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For future products, Mission Barns is mulling pork fat with a more intense flavor. “You can get away with adding less of the fat, and that has the nutritional profile of a salmon fat,” Chang said. “When we talk to partners, they’re like, ‘Oh hell yeah, sign me up.’”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The winner was a Brazilian prompt engineer named Eduardo Rocha de Andrade, who will receive $50,000 for the prize. But more surprising than the win was his final score: He won with correct answers to just 7.5% of the questions on the test.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re glad we built a benchmark that is actually hard,” said Konwinski. “Benchmarks should be hard if they’re going to matter,” he continued, adding: “Scores would be different if the big labs had entered with their biggest models. But that’s kind of the point. K Prize runs offline with limited compute, so it favors smaller and open models. I love that. It levels the playing field.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Konwinski has pledged $1 million to the first open source model that can score higher than 90% on the test.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to the well-known SWE-Bench system, the K Prize tests models against flagged issues from GitHub as a test of how well models can deal with real-world programming problems. But while SWE-Bench is based on a fixed set of problems that models can train against, the K Prize is designed as a “contamination-free version of SWE-Bench,” using a timed entry system to guard against any benchmark-specific training. For round one, models were due by March 12. The K Prize organizers then built the test using only GitHub issues flagged after that date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 7.5% top score stands in marked contrast to SWE-Bench itself, which currently shows a 75% top score on its easier “Verified” test and 34% on its harder “Full” test. Konwinski still isn’t sure whether the disparity is due to contamination on SWE-Bench or just the challenge of collecting new issues from GitHub, but he expects the K Prize project to answer the question soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we get more runs of the thing, we’ll have a better sense,” he told TechCrunch, “because we expect people to adapt to the dynamics of competing on this every few months.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It might seem like an odd place to fall short, given the wide range of AI coding tools already publicly available — but with benchmarks becoming too easy, many critics see projects like the K Prize as a necessary step toward solving <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/08/1116192/how-to-build-a-better-ai-benchmark/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI’s growing evaluation problem</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m quite bullish about building new tests for existing benchmarks,” says Princeton researcher Sayash Kapoor, who put forward a similar idea <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01502\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a recent paper</a>. “Without such experiments, we can’t actually tell if the issue is contamination, or even just targeting the SWE-Bench leaderboard with a human in the loop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Konwinski, it’s not just a better benchmark, but an open challenge to the rest of the industry. “If you listen to the hype, it’s like we should be seeing AI doctors and AI lawyers and AI software engineers, and that’s just not true,” he says. “If we can’t even get more than 10% on a contamination-free SWE-Bench, that’s the reality check for me.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

U.S. officials later <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-scrutinizes-chinese-ai-ideological-bias-memo-shows-2025-07-09/\">confirmed</a> that these tools are engineered to reflect Beijing’s talking points, raising concerns about censorship and bias.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">American AI leaders like OpenAI have pointed to this as justification for advancing their tech quickly, without too much regulation or oversight. As OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7342879984203591680/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn post</a> last month, there is a contest between “US-led democratic AI and Communist-led China’s autocratic AI.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/preventing-woke-ai-in-the-federal-government/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">An executive order</a> signed Wednesday by President Donald Trump that bans “woke AI” and AI models that aren’t “ideologically neutral” from government contracts could disrupt that balance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order calls out diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), calling it a “pervasive and destructive” ideology that can “distort the quality and accuracy of the output.” Specifically, the order refers to information about race or sex, manipulation of racial or sexual representation, critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Experts warn it could create a chilling effect on developers who may feel pressure to align model outputs and datasets with White House rhetoric to secure federal dollars for their cash-burning businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order comes the same day the White House published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">Trump’s “AI Action Plan</a>,” which shifts national priorities away from societal risk and focuses instead on building out AI infrastructure, cutting red tape for tech companies, shoring up national security, and competing with China. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order instructs the director of the Office of Management and Budget along with the administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the administrator of General Services, and the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to issue guidance to other agencies on how to comply. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Once and for all, we are getting rid of woke,” Trump said Wednesday during an AI event hosted by the All-In Podcast and Hill &amp; Valley Forum. “I will be signing an order banning the federal government from procuring AI technology that has been infused with partisan bias or ideological agendas, such as critical race theory, which is ridiculous. And from now on the U.S. government will deal only with AI that pursues truth, fairness, and strict impartiality.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Determining what is impartial or objective is one of many challenges to the order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Philip Seargeant, senior lecturer in applied linguistics at the Open University, told TechCrunch that nothing can ever be objective. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the fundamental tenets of sociolinguistics is that language is never neutral,” Seargeant said. “So the idea that you can ever get pure objectivity is a fantasy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, the Trump administration’s ideology doesn’t reflect the beliefs and values of all Americans. Trump has repeatedly sought to eliminate funding for climate initiatives, education, public broadcasting, research, social service grants, community and agricultural support programs, and gender-affirming care, often framing these initiatives as examples of “woke” or politically biased government spending. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, put it, “Anything [the Trump administration doesn’t] like is immediately tossed into this pejorative pile of woke.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The definitions of “truth-seeking” and “ideological neutrality” in the order published Wednesday are vague in some ways and specific in others. While “truth-seeking” is defined as LLMs that “prioritize historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity,” “ideological neutrality” is defined as LLMs that are “neutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those definitions leave room for broad interpretation, as well as potential pressure. AI companies have pushed for fewer constraints on how they operate. And while an executive order doesn’t carry the force of legislation, frontier AI firms could still find themselves subject to the shifting priorities of the administration’s political agenda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI <a href=\"https://www.ai.mil/Latest/News-Press/PR-View/Article/4242822/cdao-announces-partnerships-with-frontier-ai-companies-to-address-national-secu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signed contracts</a> with the Department of Defense to receive up to $200 million each to develop agentic AI workflows that address critical national security challenges. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear which of these companies is best positioned to gain from the woke AI ban, or if they will comply. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to each of them and will update this article if we hear back. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite displaying biases of its own, xAI may be the most aligned with the order — at least at this early stage. Elon Musk has positioned Grok, xAI’s chatbot, as the ultimate anti-woke, “less biased,” truthseeker. Grok’s system prompts have directed it to avoid deferring to mainstream authorities and media, to seek contrarian information even if it’s politically incorrect, and to even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-4-seems-to-consult-elon-musk-to-answer-controversial-questions/\">reference Musk’s own views</a> on controversial topics. In recent months, Grok has even spouted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/06/improved-grok-criticizes-democrats-and-hollywoods-jewish-executives/\">antisemitic comments</a> and praised Hitler on X, among other hateful, racist, and misogynistic posts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University, told TechCrunch the executive order is “clearly intended as viewpoint discrimination, since [the government] just signed a contract with Grok, aka ‘MechaHitler.’” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside xAI’s DOD funding, the company announced that “<a href=\"https://x.ai/news/government\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Grok for Government</a>” had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products are now available for purchase across every government office and agency. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The right question is this: would they ban Grok, the AI they just signed a large contract with, because it has been deliberately engineered to give politically charged answers?” Lemley said in an email interview. “If not, it is clearly designed to discriminate against a particular viewpoint.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Grok’s own system prompts have shown, model outputs can be a reflection of both the people building the technology and the data the AI is trained on. In some cases, an overabundance of caution among developers and AI trained on internet content that promotes values like inclusivity have led to distorted model outputs. Google, for example, last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/23/embarrassing-and-wrong-google-admits-it-lost-control-of-image-generating-ai/\">came under fire</a> after its Gemini chatbot showed a black George Washington and racially diverse Nazis — which Trump’s order calls out as an example of DEI-infected AI models.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chowdhury says her biggest fear with this executive order is that AI companies will actively rework training data to tow the party line. She pointed to <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1936333964693885089\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statements</a> from Musk a few weeks prior to launching Grok 4, saying that xAI would use the new model and its advanced reasoning capabilities to “rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors. Then retrain on that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This would ostensibly put Musk into the position of judging what is true, which could have huge downstream implications for how information is accessed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, companies have been making judgment calls about what information is seen and not seen since the dawn of the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conservative David Sacks — the entrepreneur and investor who Trump appointed as AI czar — has been outspoken about his concerns around “woke AI” on the All-In Podcast, which <a href=\"https://x.com/jacobhelberg/status/1945177489539580003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">co-hosted</a> Trump’s day of AI announcements. Sacks has accused the creators of prominent AI products of infusing them with left-wing values, framing his arguments as a defense of free speech, and a warning against a trend toward centralized ideological control in digital platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem, experts say, is that there is no one truth. Achieving unbiased or neutral results is impossible, especially in today’s world where even facts are politicized. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the results that an AI produces say that climate science is correct, is that left wing bias?” Seargeant said. “Some people say you need to give both sides of the argument to be objective, even if one side of the argument has no status to it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google CEO Sundar Pichai says he is “very excited” to supply OpenAI, the search giant’s largest competitor in AI, with cloud computing resources to train and serve the company’s AI models as part of a recently struck partnership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With respect to OpenAI, look, we are very excited to be partnering with them on Google Cloud,” said Pichai on Google’s second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. “Google Cloud is an open platform, and we have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups, AI labs, etc. So super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side, and we look forward to investing more in that relationship and growing that.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The comment came shortly after analysts peppered Pichai and other Google executives with questions about how AI would affect its core search business and why Google is spending an extra $10 billion on capital expenditures this year to catch up in the AI race. Roughly two and a half years since the launch of ChatGPT, Google has now shifted its focus squarely on developing leading AI models and products to compete with OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is a major threat to Google Search, but the OpenAI deal marks a massive new customer for Google Cloud. It’s a treacherous relationship for Google to navigate; OpenAI may ultimately use Google’s cloud infrastructure and chips to upend the company’s core Search product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">quietly added Google Cloud to a public list of suppliers</a> that it uses for cloud computing services, alongside Microsoft and Oracle. Reuters previously reported in June that OpenAI was considering tapping Google Cloud for <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">extra computational power</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Google Cloud revenue soared in the second quarter of 2025 to $13.6 billion, up from $10.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Google attributes a significant chunk of that growth to the Google Cloud Platform and other products it offers to AI companies. Google Cloud is still a small business relative to Google Search, but it seems to be growing in the AI era.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several large AI labs have tapped Google Cloud as a cloud computing partner, including Anthropic, Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence, Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, and now OpenAI. Pichai noted on the earnings call that the company has been successful at winning deals with large AI labs thanks to its large supply of Nvidia GPU chips and in-house TPU chips.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google Cloud seems like a smart partner for OpenAI. The startup is extremely constrained when it comes to Nvidia GPUs, which it uses to train new AI models and serve them to hundreds of millions of users. Those constraints have been a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiW6CAHf4C2kJ5ZYMKIFG6wDWajUDBxDpYq9PosVsrRdWwe8aMqzwyyxnoolw%3D%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68816068&amp;gaa_sig=8ngTmAJf4cJ4_oNOBbNI_pYVIOwWKZR1mqwbL0IQ5M-Quv5pdCQzwPUvI3Ktxtpdt4A2o1rMUSn9zdrxjz5NhA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">major tension point with OpenAI’s biggest backer and largest cloud computing partner, Microsoft</a>, forcing the ChatGPT maker to turn to its competitors in the cloud market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the AI products front, Google seems to be doing better than initially expected. The company said its AI chatbot, Gemini, now reaches 450 million monthly active users, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\">AI Overviews reaches 2 billion monthly active users</a>. However, the business around these products remains unclear, as does the share of queries they’re taking from Google Search.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to imagine that Pichai is truly that excited about working with OpenAI, a company that represents the biggest threat Google Search has ever faced. The partnership is reminiscent of Google’s deal with Yahoo from decades ago, when it was just a startup, and used Yahoo’s homepage as an accelerant to overtake it as the front door to the internet. How lasting OpenAI’s relationship with Google is remains to be seen.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841610/000114036124040642/ny20034661x2_def14a.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">September 2024 filing</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SPAC had returned much of its money to shareholders when it failed to find an acquisition target by September 2024 and held $30.5 million in trust. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, just 16 days later, the company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001841610/000114036124042068/ef20036368_8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported in an 8-K</a> that another $28.8 million had been redeemed — leaving the trust as of that date with just 0.5% of its original amount, or $1.6 million. The remaining shareholders (primarily the SPAC’s sponsors) agreed at that time to extend the date to find an acquisition target to March 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, iRocket, was at one time buzzy because it was backed by venture capital firm Village Global, which counts billionaires like Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt, and Reid Hoffman among its limited partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even still, iRocket is a surprising target for a take-public deal. The company has raised only a few million in venture funding, according to PitchBook, in an industry that is known for being extremely capital intensive. Since its founding in 2018, it has yet to conduct a single test flight of its Shockwave launch vehicle. In that time, it has been overtaken by other firms, like Stoke Space and Firefly, that are better capitalized and farther along in their hardware development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The market has changed, too: As of 2023, iRocket described Shockwave as being able to carry 300 kg to 1,500 kg payloads, and that space has become crowded with vehicles like Firefly’s Alpha and Rocket Lab’s Electron, both of which have flown customer payloads. If iRocket can prove out the rest of its value proposition — full reusability, rapid refurbishment, and 24-hour responsiveness — it could prove very competitive, but that’s a tough series of goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York-based startup lists just four employees, excluding board members, on LinkedIn. Its contracts include an $18 million deal with the Air Force Research Lab and a $1.8 million contract with the Space Force. A PR firm representing iRocket and the SPAC declined to respond to TechCrunch’s questions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The special purpose acquisition vehicle has a checkered past. Operating under the name Ross Acquisition Corp II, it tried to take public biopharma company Aprinoia Therapeutics in January 2023 but terminated the deal eight months later. After failing to consummate a transaction, the NYSE subsequently commenced delisting proceedings against the SPAC last March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RAC II changed its name to BPGC Acquisition Corp. and now has until March 2026 to close a deal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But given the SPAC’s current cash reserves, if iRocket’s existing shareholders expect to be paid much cash for their equity, the two parties will need to pull in a big chunk of money from private equity investors in a PIPE (private investment in public equity) round.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On the company’s Q2 2025 call with investors, Pichai shared that AI Overviews — a Google Search feature offering an AI summary of search results available in 200 countries and territories — now has 2 billion monthly users, up from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-ai-mode-rolls-out-to-us-will-add-support-for-deeper-research-comparison-shopping-and-more/\">1.5 billion in May 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Google’s Gemini app has grown to 450 million monthly active users. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We continue to see strong growth and engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1,” Pichai said of the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AI Mode — a way to use Google Search via an AI chat experience to get more in-depth answers — has over 100 million monthly active users, Pichai said. The service is available in the U.S. and, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/google-introduces-ai-mode-to-users-in-india/\">more recently, India</a>, but is still rolling out. The CEO also said the experience will be upgraded in the near future with the addition of the advanced research tool, Deep Search, and more personalized responses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the developer front, Google said more than 9 million have built with Gemini and over 70 million videos have been produced with the Veo 3 AI model since May. Google Vids, a Veo-powered feature for text-to-video AI generation in Google Workspace, now has nearly 1 million monthly active users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Google Meet, over 50 million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet, the company also said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stats are meant to illustrate consumer demand for AI features. For instance, Google shared that AI Overviews were driving over 10% more Google Search queries, for the types of searches that show them. However, it’s arguably difficult to determine how many people have truly and willingly turned to AI in Search, when the features have been thrust upon them as aggressively as they have been.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across Google’s platform and products, Google quantified its growth by monthly tokens processed, saying that it had announced at its developer conference in May that it had processed 480 trillion monthly tokens, and that figure has now doubled to 980 trillion monthly tokens. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio,” Pichai told investors. “Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated, full-stack approach to AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors, however, reacted negatively to Google’s plans to increase its capital expenditure spending to keep up with the AI race, which sent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/alphabet-slips-after-boosting-guidance-for-capital-expenditures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the stock slipping</a> shortly after earnings were announced.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn’t enough to close the gap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company reported Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/TSLA-Q2-2025-Update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revenue of $22.5 billion</a>, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company’s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations.

Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meanwhile, Tesla’s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Tesla noted pressure from an “uncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs” and “unclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,” the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Q2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla’s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,” the company said in its shareholder letter.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla’s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Tesla’s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales — although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Regulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company’s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla’s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Earlier this month, Tesla said it <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-second-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delivered</a> 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year, a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivered 337,000 vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">Meanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people. The case, which will allow a jury to consider punitive damages, centers on how Autopilot is advertised to its customers. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But it also doesn’t want the U.S.’s AI prowess to empower or embolden a foreign adversary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s quite the balance to strike.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If President Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Action Plan</a>, which was released on Wednesday, is any indicator, it seems the administration is still figuring out the right course of action to achieve those goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“​​America currently is the global leader on data center construction, computing hardware performance, and models,” the plan stated. “It is imperative that the United States leverage this advantage into an enduring global alliance, while preventing our adversaries from free-riding on our innovation and investment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan mentions strengthening AI chip export controls through “creative approaches” followed by a pair of policy recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first calls on government organizations, including the Department of Commerce and National Security Council, to work with the AI industry on chip location verification features. The second is a recommendation to establish an effort to figure out enforcement for potential chip export restrictions; notably, it mentions that while the U.S. and allies impose export controls on major systems required for chip manufacturing, there isn’t a focus on many of the component subsystems — a hint at where the administration wants the DOC to direct its attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Action plan also talks about how the U.S. will need to find alignment in this area with its global allies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“America must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies,” the plan states. “We should encourage partners and allies to follow U.S. controls, and not backfill. If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI Action plan never gets into detail on exactly how it will achieve Al global alliances, coordinate with allies on export chip restrictions, or work with U.S.-based AI companies on chip location verification features. Instead, the AI Action plans lay out what foundational building blocks are required for future sustainable AI chip export guidelines, as opposed to policies implemented on top of existing guidelines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upshot: Chip export restrictions are going to take more time. And there’s ample evidence, beyond the AI Action plan, to suggest it will. For instance, the Trump administration has contradicted itself multiple times on its export restriction strategy in the past few months — including just last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In July, the administration gave semiconductor firms, like Nvidia and AMD, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/nvidias-resumption-of-h20-chip-sales-related-to-rare-earth-element-trade-talks/\">the green light to start selling AI chips</a> they had developed for China, just months after rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/\">licensing restrictions on the same AI chips</a> that effectively pulled Nvidia out of the Chinese market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The administration also formally rescinded the Biden administration’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/\">AI diffusion rule</a> (which put a cap on how much AI computing capacity some countries were allowed to buy) in May, just days before it was supposed to go into effect. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration is expected to sign multiple executive orders on July 23. Whether these will contain detailed plans on how it will reach its goals is unclear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the AI Action Plan talks at length about figuring out how to expand the U.S. AI market globally, while maintaining dominance, it’s light on the specifics. Any executive order regarding chip export restrictions will likely be about getting the proper government departments together to figure out a path forward, as opposed to formal guidelines, quite yet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The fee for the event is $600.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/y-combinator-cuts-nearly-20-of-staff-scales-back-growth-stage-investments/\">YC laid off most of the folks</a> putting on this event between a small layoff about a year ago and a larger one in 2023. These layoffs were surprising at the time because Y Combinator’s events have always been highly popular and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/25/in-2024-it-really-is-better-to-run-a-startup-in-san-francisco-according-to-data-and-founders-whove-relocated/\">were a major force in making San Francisco the hub</a> for the burgeoning AI startup community.

The founders of app vibe coding startup Rork were almost broke when a viral tweet led them to raise $2.8 million and nab <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/rorks-founders-were-almost-broke-when-a-viral-tweet-led-to-2-8m-and-a16z/\">a spot in a16z’s Speedrun program</a>. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/defense-tech-theseus-landed-y-combinator-the-us-special-forces-and-4-3m-from-a-tweet/\">Defense tech startup Theseus</a> landed a contract with the U.S. Special Forces, $4.3 million in funding, and a spot in YC, from a viral X post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the folks behind the new event could help YC founders, they believe they can help founders who aren’t part of the famed program — and on the cheap without giving up equity. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The organization on Wednesday announced it’s launching a campaign that introduces banners inside its Android and iOS apps, prompting users to make a monetary donation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, the feature will be shown only to those on the Mastodon servers the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/mastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure/\">nonprofit</a> itself operates, Mastodon.social and Mastodon.online. These banners will be easy to dismiss, Mastodon says, and will only be shown to people who have accounts that have existed for at least four weeks. The organization promises that it won’t continually prompt users to donate, either.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such campaigns can work well for nonprofit organizations at scale. Wikimedia Foundation, for example, brings in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising/2024_banners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">majority</a> of its funding from individual donors, including those who donate through the pop-up banners that occasionally appear on Wikipedia. However, Mastodon has a much smaller user base: 8.1 million <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fedidb.com/\">r</a><a href=\"https://fedidb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">e</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fedidb.com/\">gistered</a> accounts, and fewer than 1 million monthly active users. Still, the banners could encourage people who haven’t actively sought out ways to contribute to now do so, as it makes the process more seamless as an in-app feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon says it will later expand the campaign to the web and, if successful, make it available to all other Mastodon instances. The latter would allow individual server admins to receive direct support from their own users, which could help keep them operational. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an open, decentralized social media platform, Mastodon faces challenges when it comes to financial support. Unlike Meta and X, which are supported by ads, Mastodon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/amid-twitter-chaos-mastodon-grew-donations-488-in-2022-reached-1-8m-monthly-active-users/\">so far has relied largely on</a> user donations from Patreon. It has also accepted a handful of donations from open source-focused funds and foundations over the years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/reports/Mastodon%20Annual%20Report%202023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2023</a>, Mastodon raised €545,000 in total donations, up 65% year-over-year, but its Patreon donor base dropped nearly 23% to 7,400. (Its 2024 report is not out yet.) That decline could have pushed it to look into more aggressive fundraising tactics, especially as competition from Meta and newcomers like the VC-backed startup Bluesky is growing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know that collecting money can present complexities and questions,” a Mastodon <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/07/a-nudge-to-fund-our-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> stated. “We’d like to figure out how to do this well, together with the community. This is not a corporate fundraising campaign: it’s an effort to secure the future of a more ethical and independent social web.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
