Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NHTSA has opened an <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investigation</a> into the accident, and Waymo said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/a-commitment-to-transparency-and-road-safety\">blog post</a> that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at 6 miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">probe</a> into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the National Transportation Safety Board opened its own <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investigation</a> last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From the outside, Upwind Security looks like it’s had a smooth journey so far. Just four years in, the cloud security startup is now worth $1.5 billion, and boasts the likes of Siemens, Peloton, Roku, Wix, Nextdoor and Nubank among its clientele. But if you ask the company’s co-founder and CEO Amiram Shachar, the journey to get here was anything but certain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Three years ago, we would spend hours asking ourselves if we were heading in the right direction, and 80% of the time, it felt like we weren’t,” a candid Shachar told TechCrunch in an interview following the startup’s recent $250 million Series B. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the beginning, we constantly questioned whether the market needed our solution, whether it would be too hard to integrate into larger systems, or if customers would adopt it,” he recalled. “Developing a new approach was difficult; people are used to installing certain agents on machines, but they don’t like doing it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upwind likes to call that approach “runtime” security: Prioritizing alerts and remediation efforts around threats and vulnerabilities in active services in real time. As Shachar puts it, it’s an “inside-out” take on cloud security, where internal signals like network requests and API traffic function as context to help security teams separate urgent risks from those that can wait. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developing that approach wasn’t easy, however, as Shachar and his co-founders didn’t have a traditional background in security: they first built and sold a cloud compute brokerage called  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/06/04/netapp-spot-io-acquisition/\">Spot.io, to NetApp</a> for around $450 million in 2020. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After joining NetApp post the Spot acquisition, I experienced first-hand how difficult cloud security really is,” Shachar said. “The security team would scan our environment and report issues, but they lacked critical context. Coming from a DevOps background, we (Shachar and his team) understood the infrastructure deeply, while security teams often didn’t know how APIs were exposed or which packages were running. As a result, they flagged many issues that weren’t real risks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Shachar and his team felt they had better insight into cloud environments because they were running them. “The dominant approach was agentless, an ‘outside-in’ model where you scan environments externally,” he explained. “It’s easy to deploy, but it creates a lot of noise because you can only see what’s visible from the outside.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team realized that the context provided by internal signals would be more useful to security teams, as they’d get to see what was happening in the network, in real time. But selling their new take on cloud security proved challenging, as security teams often lack permission to deploy software internally and default to more traditional tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So Upwind sales took time. “It wasn’t clear at first, and there was a lot of uncertainty; customers were hesitant,” Shachar said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But we saw something others didn’t,” he explained. “Inside-out isn’t an advanced option; it’s the only way to solve the next generation of problems. With ephemeral infrastructure like containers, serverless workloads, AI agents talking to each other, and data constantly moving through APIs, you simply can’t map this from the outside. It has to be inside.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the company had to contend with an overcrowded security market. Security teams were already overwhelmed by the number of tools, and customers didn’t want multiple products just to manage cloud security. “From the beginning, it was clear that Upwind would need to build a broad, integrated platform,” Shachar said. “Otherwise, customers wouldn’t engage or allow us to deploy our technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s logic eventually spoke to its target customers: large, data-intensive organizations with sizable cloud footprints. Since its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/confirmed-cloud-security-specialist-upwind-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation/\">$100 million Series A in 2024</a>, Upwind has grown rapidly, posting 900% year-over-year revenue growth and doubling its customer base. The company has also expanded from its core markets in the U.S., U.K. and Israel to emerging markets including Australia, India, Singapore, and Japan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $250 million Series B was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Salesforce Ventures and Picture Capital. The fresh cash will be used for product development and go-to-market motions, and the startup plans to invest in its AI security capabilities within its core cloud security platform and “extend its approach closer to developers to help prevent misconfigurations before they reach production.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Liquid Glass design introduced with iOS 26 didn’t get the glowing reviews the company probably expected, and Apple’s chief of user interface design, Alan Dye, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/meta-poaches-apple-design-exec-alan-dye-to-lead-new-creative-studio-in-reality-labs/\">left for Meta</a>, in December. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And last week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/apple-hardware-chief-john-ternus-now-overseeing-design-tim-cook-ceo-succession\">Bloomberg</a> reported that John Ternus, who is in line to be Tim Cook’s successor, took over hardware and software design towards the end of last year.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Notably, the service now receives 60,000 AI tracks per day, totaling 13.4 million AI-detected songs. By contrast, in June of last year, fully AI-generated music made up 18% of daily uploads, surpassing 20,000 tracks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Deezer claims its AI music detection tool can identify every AI-generated track from major generative models like Suno and Udio. In addition to excluding AI-generated tracks from recommendations, Deezer’s tool demonetizes them and excludes them from the royalty pool, as the company aims to fairly compensate musicians and songwriters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool’s accuracy is 99.8%, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier says there has been “great interest” in the tool, and several companies have “already performed successful tests.” One such company is Sacem, the French management company that represents over 300,000 music creators and publishers, including David Guetta and DJ Snake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The company didn’t provide pricing information or disclose which additional companies are interested in adopting the tool.

Now, in a development that seems directly related, the company has revealed that the unit lost many billions of dollars last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, Meta’s <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-302673127.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings report</a> showed that its embattled virtual reality business had lost some $19.1 billion in 2025, which is slightly more than it lost in 2024 (that year, the losses hovered around $17.7 billion). In its fourth quarter, the unit posted a loss of $6.2 billion, the report shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those losses stood against what the unit generated in sales: $955 million in Q4 and some $2.2 billion throughout 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg struck a tone of optimism for his company’s VR team while noting that losses in 2026 are expected to be very much the same.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,” Zuckerberg said, during the call. However, the CEO noted that losses were expected to continue. “I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year,” Zuckerberg said, while noting that this year would “likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Meta announced a pivot toward the “metaverse” in 2021, the move was regarded with a certain amount of skepticism and, during its first year of VR efforts, the company <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/10/07/metas-horizon-world-quality-poor-not-even-employees-using-says-metaverse-vp-leaked-memo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">faced harsh criticism</a> — even being referred to as an “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/08/18/mark-zuckerberg-mocked-metaverse-selfie-10-billion-reality-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">international laughingstock</a>.” Nearly half a decade later, that skepticism <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/well-there-goes-the-metaverse/\">hasn’t exactly subsided</a>. As the VR business continues to lose money and Meta continues an aggressive pivot away from VR and toward AI, it’s unclear what exactly will turn the ailing business around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/13/meta-lays-off-vr-employees-underscoring-zuckerbergs-pivot-to-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a>, in addition to the layoffs, Meta had plans to shutter a number of its VR studios — another sign that the company’s interest in virtual reality is waning. The company also recently announced that it would be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-closing-down-its-vr-meeting-rooms-as-part-of-its-wider-cull-140000422.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">retiring its standalone Workrooms app</a> — which the company had pitched to office workers as a VR space that could be used to hold meetings.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Both <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/google-launches-new-protocol-for-agent-driven-purchases/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">OpenAI</a> have built platforms for agent-enabled transactions, with companies like Stripe and Uber signed on as partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while other AI labs have already built significant technical infrastructure, Meta believes its access to personal data will prove uniquely valuable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content and our relationships,” Zuckerberg said on the call. “A lot of what makes agents valuable is the unique context that they can see, and we believe that Meta will be able to provide a uniquely personal experience.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/manus-joins-meta-accelerating-ai-innovation-for-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In December</a>, Meta acquired the general-purpose agent developer Manus, which provides similar technology. At the time, Meta said it would “continue to operate and sell the Manus service, as well as integrate it into our products.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investor call was timed to the release of <a href=\"https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2026/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Meta’s most recent quarterly earnings</a>, which also disclosed a significant increase in new infrastructure spending. The company now anticipates that it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion on overall capital expenditures over the course of 2026, up from $72 billion in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its official filing, Meta attributed the jump to “increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While significant, the figure still falls short of the projected $600 billion that Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly projected</a> for Meta’s infrastructure spending through 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has previously drawn criticism from investors for failing to clearly state how its massive AI investment will translate to the company’s bottom line. But while details are still thin, Zuckerberg made it clear that the AI lab’s work would reach the public soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is going to be a big year for delivering personal superintelligence, accelerating our business, building infrastructure for the future, and shaping how our company will work going forward,” he told investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But recent changes to federal nuclear safety policies could be another accelerant that helps clear the way for speedy reactor development and at a potential cost to human and environmental health.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration has quietly changed how the Department of Energy oversees the safety and security of nuclear power plants built on its properties, according to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/28/nx-s1-5677187/nuclear-safety-rules-rewritten-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report from NPR</a>. About a third of the rulebook has been axed, and several sections have been heavily revised. Previous requirements, including those aimed at limiting groundwater and environmental contamination, are now suggestions, and workers can be exposed to higher doses of radiation. Plant security protocols are now largely up to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new rules were developed without public comment or notice, according to NPR. They only apply to reactors built on DOE property; those built elsewhere are still subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight. Several startups are developing demonstration reactors on DOE property in the hopes of hitting a Trump administration deadline of July 4, 2026.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The software giant has invested more than $13 billion in the AI lab, which is currently looking to raise additional funding at a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/openai-s-altman-meets-mideast-investors-for-50-billion-round\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, Microsoft and OpenAI renegotiated some of the terms of their deal when OpenAI restructured into a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/openai-secures-microsofts-blessing-to-transition-its-for-profit-arm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">public benefit corporation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of that deal, OpenAI agreed to buy another $250 billion of Azure services. That commitment shows on <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q2/metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Microsoft’s books</a> as “commercial remaining performance obligations,” or contracts that Microsoft has that have not yet been paid out. Those obligations leaped to $625 billion from $392 billion in the previous quarter. Microsoft said that 45% of that is from OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic got a shout-out in the quarterly earnings, too, in helping boost Microsoft’s anticipated future revenue in the form of commercial bookings, which grew 230%. In November, Microsoft <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-nvidia-and-anthropic-announce-strategic-partnerships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> that it was investing $5 billion into Anthropic and the AI lab had signed up for $30 billion of Azure compute capacity, with intent to buy more later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Microsoft is also spending big to feed the AI machine. It spent $37.5 billion in the quarter on capital expenditures, two-thirds of which were for what Microsoft called “short-lived” assets: primarily the GPUs and CPUs for its cloud Azure to serve AI.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company reported $81.3 billion in revenue (Wall Street analysts expected $80.27 billion, so that’s a solid beat), up 17% over the year-ago period.

Once production ends, Tesla will build Optimus robots in the same factory space, according to Musk. Production of Tesla’s Cybertruck, which is made at the company’s factory outside of Austin, will continue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-motors-delivers-worlds-first-premium-electric-sedan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched</a> the Model S in 2012, and it’s regarded as the first car that made electric vehicles widely appealing. The Model X was Tesla’s second major electric vehicle program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla always intended for its more affordable models — the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV — to greatly outsell their predecessors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But sales of both models have flatlined in recent years, despite interior and exterior refreshes along the way. Tesla has faced increased competition in the luxury EV space from legacy automakers, as well as upstarts like Rivian and Lucid Motors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So that is slightly sad, but it’s… it is time to bring the S and X programs to an end,” Musk said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tesla-s-first-ground-up-design\">Tesla’s first ground-up design</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model S was not Tesla’s first car — that title goes to the original Roadster. But the Model S was the first car Tesla created from the ground up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That helped it ditch a lot of the tradeoffs of the Roadster, and paved the way for the Model S to become one of the first true mass-market electric vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla launched the sedan in 2012 with a base price of $57,400. It had a floor-mounted battery that helped make it roomier and far more dynamic to drive than the few other all-electric vehicles that were available at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla also offered the Model S with multiple battery sizes, allowing customers to pay up for more EV range. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The car was instantly popular, with Tesla collecting more than 10,000 reservations for it by the time the first deliveries started in June of that year. By 2013, it had become MotorTrend’s <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/2013-motor-trend-car-of-the-year-tesla-model-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">car of the year</a>, beating out the best gas cars from around the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At its core, the Tesla Model S is simply a damned good car you happen to plug in to refuel,” MotorTrend wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla iterated on the Model S in the years that followed. It changed up battery options — at one point even offering larger battery packs with range that was software-limited, in a bid to get customers to adopt a sort of “buy now pay later” attitude. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model S was also the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/17/teslas-model-s-gets-ludicrous-mode-will-do-0-60-in-2-8-seconds/\">first Tesla</a> to get “Ludicrous Mode,” which made it possible to go from 0 to 60 m.p.h in just 2.8 seconds. It was an exhilarating feature that also became one of Tesla’s sharpest word-of-mouth marketing tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla kept improving the Model S, giving it industry-leading range that still beats most other EVs and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh\">an overall exterior and interior refresh</a> in 2021. But by that point the company’s success had skyrocketed on the backs of the much cheaper Model 3 and Model Y. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-faberge-suv\">The Fabergé SUV</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model X was not so straightforward. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/10/tesla-model-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">teased</a> before the release of the Model S in 2012, the Model X SUV didn’t hit the streets until 2015. When it did, it arrived with overly complex “Falcon Wing” rear doors that folded up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These made it extremely easy to get in and out of the Model X. But the doors — along with the rest of the SUV — proved to be very hard to build at scale with any reliable quality over the years. Musk eventually <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/elon-musk-model-s-model-x-production-continues-for-sentimental-reasons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">called</a> it the “Fabergé of cars.” It was a nod to the luxury stylings and features, but also to the Model X’s brittle nature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model X still sold fairly well alongside the S, and it also received a big refresh in 2021. But production problems plagued the new version, too, and Musk admitted in early 2022 that Tesla made a mistake by halting production before the redesigned Model X was <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2022/02/10/tesla-delays-model-x-deliveries-elon-musk-admits-problems-production-ramp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ready to be made at scale</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-long-time-coming\">A long time coming</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In hindsight, the retirement of the Model S and Model X have been a long time coming. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk himself <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/elon-musk-model-s-model-x-production-continues-for-sentimental-reasons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a> in 2019 that Tesla was still making these “niche” vehicles more for “sentimental reasons than anything else.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They are really of minor importance to our future,” Musk said at the time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At that point, Tesla was still selling tens of thousands of Model S and Model X SUVs per quarter. But the company’s first truly new model was on the horizon: the Cybertruck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revealed in 2019, Tesla had big plans for the Cybertruck. The company stated it would sell a base version for $40,000, and make 250,000 of them a year. Delays brought on by the Covid pandemic, along with the vehicle’s complex new design, meant the vehicle hit the market far later than anticipated.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once it did hit the road, the Cybertruck bombed — although Tesla continues to publicly support it, including during Wednesday’s earnings call. A supposed backlog of 2 million orders never materialized, and neither did the $40,000 base price. Tesla has struggled to sell just a few thousand of them per quarter ever since.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Cybertruck’s failure likely gave the Model S and Model X some cover. Not only did the two legacy EVs help <em>slightly </em>offset the garish truck’s terrible popularity, Tesla also bucketed the three vehicles as “other models” when reporting quarterly sales figures, making it hard to say just how badly the Cybertruck was doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Tesla is now a company aimed at solving autonomy in cars, and in robots, according to Musk. That’s apparently what ultimately did in the Model S and Model X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They may have been of “minor importance” to [Tesla’s] future seven years ago. But they will always be crucial to the company’s early years, and the construction of Musk as an uber-rich businessman who now looms over modern society.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And I think that we’re at a moment similar to when smartphones arrived, and it was clearly only a matter of time until all those flip phones became smartphones,” Zuckerberg said. “It’s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren’t AI glasses.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that sales of Meta’s glasses tripled within the last year, and he believes that they’re “some of the fastest growing consumer electronics in history.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Take Zuckerberg’s outlook with a grain of salt. After all, he also thought that we would go to work and hang out with our friends in the metaverse — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/meta-avatars-are-finally-getting-legs-in-beta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legs optional</a> — and that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/meta-reportedly-plans-to-slash-metaverse-budget-by-up-to-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">didn’t work out</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But based on how tech’s biggest players are allocating their money and effort, it does seem like AI glasses are poised for a big moment, even if it’s not on the scale of the smartphone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is expected to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/googles-first-ai-glasses-expected-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launch</a> a line of smart glasses this year, following a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-commits-150m-to-develop-ai-glasses-with-warby-parker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$150 million deal</a> with Warby Parker.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three weeks ago, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, revealed it raised $20 billion in a <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/series-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Series E funding round</a>. Now we know Tesla is among its investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla disclosed in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">letter to shareholders</a> on Wednesday that it invested $2 billion in xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot that also owns <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Musk’s social media company X</a>. Other <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/series-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously disclosed</a> investors in xAI include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, as well as Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is a truly circular deal and one that Tesla shareholders voted against last year. In November, shareholders were asked in a nonbinding measure to allow the Tesla board to authorize an investment in xAI. About 1.06 billion votes were in favor, and 916.3 million opposed, per <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-07/tesla-shareholders-didn-t-approve-authorizing-investment-in-xai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg’s reporting</a> at the time. While that would seem like an approval, the number of abstentions — which count as votes against in Tesla’s bylaws — meant the measure was rejected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla proceeded anyway and offered up an argument, in its shareholder letter and during its earnings call, in support of the investment. Tesla’s justification appears to be tied to xAI’s alignment with its most recent master plan — and how these companies are about to get a lot closer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As set forth in Master Plan Part IV, Tesla is building products and services that bring AI into the physical world. Meanwhile, xAI is developing leading digital AI products and services, such as its large language model (Grok),” the shareholder letter reads. “In that context, and as part of Tesla’s broader strategy under Master Plan Part IV, Tesla and xAI also entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla said the agreement builds upon an existing relationship with xAI by “providing a framework for evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla already supplies its Megapack batteries to power xAI data centers, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1924684815548207566\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed last year</a>, and the company <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/support/grok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has included</a> the xAI chatbot Grok into some of its vehicles. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-09/musk-s-xai-reports-higher-quarterly-loss-plans-to-power-optimus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also reported</a> that xAI told investors it plans to build AI for humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk noted that there are many tasks Tesla can do internally. “But if there are things xAI can help accelerate our progress, then why should we not do that?” he asked. “And that is the reason why we’ve gone ahead with such an investment. Because this is part of the strategic initiative.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its letter to shareholders, Tesla highlighted these and other developments in physical AI and robotics, including plans for developing its Optimus robot, semitrucks, and other autonomous capabilities. The company broadly beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue, but profit <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fell 46% last year</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Together, the investment and the related framework agreement are intended to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale,” Tesla said in the shareholder letter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The investment is expected to close in the first quarter. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk and Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja signaled during the company’s earnings call it expect other capital expenditures that support its mission. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This year for Tesla is the first major steps as we increase vehicle autonomy and begin to produce Optimus robots at scale — we’re making very, very big investments,” Musk said on the call. “So this is going to be a very big capex here; that is deliberate, because we’re making big investments for an epic future.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the company has not clarified how it will make this determination, or whether it includes images that have been edited using traditional tools, like Adobe’s Photoshop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, the only details on the new feature come from a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2016387626257813518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cryptic X post from Elon Musk</a> saying, “Edited visuals warning,” as he reshares an announcement of a new X feature made by the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/16i4s5d/using_investigative_journalism_to_answer_the/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">anonymous</a> X account <a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/2016385433849221135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DogeDesigner</a>. That account is often used as a proxy for introducing new X features, as Musk will repost from it to share news.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, details on the new system are thin. DogeDesigner’s post claimed X’s new feature could make it “harder for legacy media groups to spread misleading clips or pictures.” It also claimed the feature is new to X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before it was acquired and renamed as X, the company known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/twitters-policy-on-deepfakes-and-manipulated-media-will-only-remove-harmful-tweets-including-voter-suppression/\">Twitter had labeled tweets</a> using manipulated, deceptively altered, or fabricated media as an alternative to removing them. Its policy wasn’t limited to AI but included things like “selected editing or cropping or slowing down or overdubbing, or manipulation of subtitles,” the site integrity head, Yoel Roth, said in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear if X is adopting the same rules or has made any significant changes to tackle AI. Its help <a href=\"https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/authenticity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">documentation</a> currently says there’s a policy against sharing inauthentic media, but it’s rarely enforced, as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">recent deepfake debacle</a> of users sharing non-consensual nude images showed. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/us/politics/nekima-armstrong-photo-white-house.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">even the White House now shares manipulated images.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling something “manipulated media” or an “AI image” can be nuanced. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that X is a playground for <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-turned-x-trump-echo-chamber-rcna174321\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">political</a> <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2024/02/16/china-based-propaganda-accounts-flourish-on-x-as-others-try-to-curb-them/72628213007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">propaganda</a>, both domestically and abroad, some understanding of how the company determines what’s “edited,” or perhaps AI-generated or AI-manipulated, should be documented. In addition, users should know whether or not there’s any sort of dispute process beyond X’s crowdsourced Community Notes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Meta discovered when it introduced AI image labeling in 2024, it’s easy for detection systems to go awry. In its case, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/meta-tagging-real-photos-made-with-ai/\">Meta was found to be incorrectly tagging</a> real photographs with its “Made with AI” label, even though they had not been created using generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This happened because AI features are increasingly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/adobe-brings-firefly-ai-powered-generative-remove-to-lightroom/\">being integrated</a> into creative tools used by photographers and graphic artists. (Apple’s new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/with-apples-new-creator-studio-pro-ai-is-a-tool-to-aid-creation-not-replace-it/\">Creator Studio suite, launching today</a>, is one recent example.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it turned out, this confused Meta’s identification tools. For instance, Adobe’s cropping tool was flattening images before saving them as a JPEG, triggering Meta’s AI detector. <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2024/05/28/instagram-photos-are-being-labeled-made-with-ai-when-theyre-not/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In another example,</a> Adobe’s Generative AI Fill, which is used to remove objects — like wrinkles in a shirt, or an unwanted reflection — was also causing images to be labeled as “Made with AI,” when they were only edited with AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/01/meta-changes-its-label-from-made-with-ai-to-ai-info-to-indicate-use-of-ai-in-photos/\">Meta updated its label to say “AI info,</a>” so as not to outright label images as “Made with AI” when they had not been. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, there’s a standards-setting body for verifying the authenticity and content provenance for digital content, known as the <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">C2PA</a> (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity). There are also related initiatives like <a href=\"https://contentauthenticity.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CAI</a>, or Content Authenticity Initiative, and <a href=\"https://iptc.org/media-provenance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Project Origin</a>, focused on adding tamper-evident provenance metadata to media content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presumably, X’s implementation would abide by some sort of known process for identifying AI content, but X’s owner, Elon Musk, didn’t say what that is. Nor did he clarify whether he’s talking specifically about AI images, or just anything that’s not the photo being uploaded to X directly from your smartphone’s camera. It’s even unclear whether the feature is brand-new, as DogeDesigner claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X isn’t the only outlet grappling with manipulated media. In addition to Meta, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/tiktok-now-lets-you-choose-how-much-ai-generated-content-you-want-to-see/\">TikTok</a> has also been labeling AI content. Streaming services like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/deezer-starts-labeling-ai-generated-music-to-tackle-streaming-fraud/\">Deezer</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/spotify-updates-ai-policy-to-label-tracks-cut-down-on-spam/\">Spotify</a> are also scaling initiatives to identify and label AI music, as well. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/answer/16496549?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google Photos is using C2PA</a> to indicate how photos on its platform were made. Microsoft, the BBC, Adobe, Arm, Intel, Sony, OpenAI, and others are on <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/membership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the C2PA’s steering committee</a>, while many more companies have joined as members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X is not currently listed among the <a href=\"https://c2pa.org/membership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">members</a>, though we’ve reached out to C2PA to see if that recently changed. X doesn’t typically respond to requests for comment, but we asked anyway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Whew!</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reason for the excitement? Outtake, founded in 2023 by a former Palantir engineer, Alex Dhillon, has found a way to automate what has largely been the manual problem of spotting and taking down digital identity posers: impersonation accounts, malicious domains posing as the company’s, rogue apps, fraudulent ads, and more. This problem has grown even more difficult because AI has enabled attackers to be more convincing and faster in their efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We kept hearing whispers in our network about an AI company that was finally solving digital misrepresentation at scale. Honestly, we were skeptical,” Joshi told TechCrunch. “Historically, detection and takedown was (and to some extent even today) a manual, human-intensive process that couldn’t keep up with the speed of the internet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But once Iconiq looked at the product and did its due diligence with customers, the investor became a believer, he said. “They’ve turned a ‘human problem’ into a ‘software problem.’ Seeing AI take down digital frauds in real time is a game-changer for brand safety,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dhillon told TechCrunch his experience at Palantir is what led him to gaining so many notable angels. “I worked directly for Shyam Sankar at Palantir when I was part of the experimental product team,” he explained. This led him to meet many of the Palantir powers, current and former, including Stephens, who worked there in its earlier years. (Stephens is also a VC for Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.) One introduction led to another which led to moguls writing checks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outtake names among its customers OpenAI, Pershing Square, AppLovin, and federal agencies. OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/outtake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">even profiled the company</a> in July 2025 as an example of an agentic startup built on its reasoning models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says it has seen major growth all around, with annual recurring revenue increasing sixfold year-over-year and its customer base growing more than tenfold. Last year alone, Outtake says, its systems scanned 20 million potential cyberattacks. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Total revenue from car sales fell 11% year-over-year, too. Tesla already revealed that it shipped 1.63 million cars globally across 2025. That marks the second year in a row that its sales have declined, after Musk spent years promising average annual growth of 50%.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors largely expected the decline in sales in Tesla’s fourth quarter and full-year results for 2025, and the company beat Wall Street’s estimates for earnings and revenue, sending shares up in after-market trading Wednesday. It’s been largely buoyed by strength in its other industries and investments, including energy capabilities and AI, as Tesla has continued to lure investors’ attention away from its stalled-out automotive business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company wrote in its shareholder letter: “2025 marked a critical year for Tesla as we further expanded our mission and continued our transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company revealed in the letter that it recently invested $2 billion in Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, part of the latter’s recent <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/series-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Series E funding round</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revenue from Tesla’s solar and energy storage businesses also grew 25% compared to 2024, and services revenue (which includes payments for Full Self-Driving software, insurance, parts, and Supercharging) grew 18%. The company was even able to grow its gross margin compared to prior quarters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long-awaited projects like the Tesla Semi (first revealed in 2017) and the Cybercab (which debuted in 2024, but has been teased for years) are supposed to enter production in the first half of this year, according to Tesla.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has a <em>lot </em>of other projects on its plate, which were detailed in the shareholder letter.

This partnership involves further embedding of Anthropic’s AI models into ServiceNow’s platform for its customers and bringing Anthropic’s AI to its employees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ServiceNow declined to clarify the duration of the partnership or the monetary size of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal entails making Anthropic’s Claude model family the preferred AI models across ServiceNow’s AI-driven workflow products. Claude is now also the default model powering the company’s AI agent builder, ServiceNow Build Agent, which allows developers to create agentic workflows and build apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal also involves the rollout of Claude to the company’s 29,000 ServiceNow employees.

Each model brings different strengths, and our role is to orchestrate them in ways that deliver the best outcomes for customers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal is just the latest one for Anthropic, which has announced a number of sizable enterprise deals in recent months.

The company ultimately decided to stick with the $33 million bid it received from MicroVision during <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/luminar-receives-a-larger-33-million-bid-for-its-lidar-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an auction on Monday</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The identity of who submitted this long-shot offer was not revealed, but Luminar’s lawyer said it was an “insider purchaser,” meaning it likely came from company founder Austin Russell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell had already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/ousted-luminar-ceo-austin-russell-wants-to-buy-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tried to buy the company</a> late last year before it slid into bankruptcy (and after he abruptly resigned as CEO). Representatives of his new firm Russell AI Labs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/luminar-founder-austin-russell-agrees-to-accept-subpoena-in-bankruptcy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">previously told TechCrunch</a> he was interested in submitting a bid on the lidar business during the bankruptcy case. (Those same representatives did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hearing moved forward, and the sale to MicroVision was approved. The sale of Luminar’s semiconductor division to a company called Quantum Computing Inc. was also approved. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transactions are likely to close in the coming weeks, and after that, the company will cease to exist, bringing an end to one of the buzzier suppliers of the budding autonomous vehicle era.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-microvision-wants\">What MicroVision wants</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell’s goal of using lidar to help cars drive themselves will continue on at MicroVision, according to its CEO Glen DeVos. As part of the asset sale, MicroVision will get Luminar’s lidar tech as well as its remaining staff, and he said he’s hopeful some of the other talent that was laid off prior to bankruptcy will come on board, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For DeVos, Luminar’s lidar technology is the piece MicroVision has been missing from his company’s portfolio. The Redmond, Washington-based company doesn’t have the same profile as the leaders in the lidar sector like Aeva, Innoviz, Hesai, or Ouster, but that’s in part because it lacked the long-range sensing capability that is crucial to automotive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MicroVision has a “very strong” software team, DeVos said in an interview with TechCrunch, and a similarly strong short-range lidar team. But DeVos, who spent a long career at automotive suppliers Delphi and Aptiv, and took over as MicroVision CEO last year, wants to expand beyond its current markets of industrial use, security, and defense.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So when we look at the Luminar engineering team, and what they’ve done, we said: ‘Hey, that’s a great compliment from an engineering capability standpoint,’” Devos said. “That’s critical in this area in terms of trying to win automotive business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeVos said he’s hopeful that MicroVision can take Luminar’s existing commercial engagements with automakers — even the ones in tatters, like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contract with Volvo</a> — and use those as a springboard into automotive, which would represent a huge new pool of potential revenue for his company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve been in the automotive industry a long time. I have experience where contractual relationships have gone off the rails, and basically, worked very hard to put those back together. We’re going to look at every single one of those. We’re not going to assume any of them are beyond saving,” he said. “You never want to get there, but, you know, there’s ways of putting those pieces back together.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-second-mystery-bidder\">A second mystery bidder?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the sale approval is behind him, Tuesday’s offer wasn’t the first time DeVos and MicroVision found themselves up against a mysterious bidder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the hearing, lawyers for Luminar and Rich Morgner, a managing director at Jeffries (which was helping run the sale process), revealed that another unidentified party was forming a bid as far back as January 12.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That bid was problematic from the jump, Morgner said. At first, the party’s financing was coming from a “Chinese national company.” When Luminar expressed concerns about regulatory approval, Morgner said the bidder replaced its funding with three different non-Chinese sources.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One was family money, which we were ultimately able to verify. The second was an SPV under the Caymans, which had a brokerage statement showing a round number of funds. And then we also had a European family office that was also part of the financing syndicate,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the lawyers and bankers were able to verify the “family money” was dependable, Morgner said the large round number in the Caymans SPV seemed suspicious.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The concern was the money came in … [so] money could come out. It wasn’t like looking at a long, dated brokerage statement, where you could see the ebbs and flows in the various different securities,” he said. Proof of funds from the European family office source was also never provided.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar’s lawyers never revealed the identity of the bidder, or whether it was the same party that submitted the offer that disrupted Tuesday’s hearing.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move comes after the company’s ban on third-party chatbots on WhatsApp took effect on January 15. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Meta will charge developers in Italy, where the country’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/italy-tells-meta-to-suspend-its-policy-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/\">competition watchdog asked the company to suspend its policy last December</a>. The company said that the new pricing for non-template responses will begin on February 16. Meta plans to charge $0.0691/ €0.0572 / £0.0498 per message to developers for AI responses. This could result in steep bills for developers if users are exchanging thousands of queries with AI chatbots every day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Meta sent notices to developers creating an exemption for Italian phone numbers and allowing AI chatbots to serve those customers. At that time, the company didn’t mention any plans to charge developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, WhatsApp already charges companies for using its API for various template responses to customers, which include use cases like marketing, utility, or authentication. This includes messages users receive about payment reminders and shipping updates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where we are legally required to provide AI chatbots through the WhatsApp business API, we are introducing pricing for the companies that choose to use our platform to provide those services,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. This could also establish a precedent for other geographies if Meta has to cave in and allow developers to operate their chatbots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta first announced this past October that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">it would block all third-party AI chatbots from using WhatsApp through its WhatsApp Business API</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta said its systems weren’t designed to handle responses from AI bots and were being strained. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. This logic assumes WhatsApp is somehow a de facto app store. The route to market for AI companies is the app stores themselves, their websites, and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform,” the company said at that time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, various regions, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/eu-investigating-meta-over-policy-change-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/\">the EU</a>, Italy, and Brazil, have started anticompetitive probes. Brazil’s watchdog initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/brazil-orders-meta-to-suspend-policy-banning-third-party-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/\">asked Meta to suspend the policy</a>. However, a court in Brazil <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/brazil-court-suspends-antitrust-ruling-against-meta-over-whatsapp-business-2026-01-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sided with Meta last week</a> and overturned the preliminary order blocking the new policy. As a result, the company has asked developers not to provide their AI chatbots to users in Brazil, TechCrunch has learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the policy has kicked in, developers are forced to send a pre-defined message to users of their AI chatbot on WhatsApp to redirect them to their site or app. Providers like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Microsoft announced last year that their WhatsApp bots would not work after January 15, urging users to access them on other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Cleanlab, founded in 2021, is a startup that provides software for improving the quality of data produced by human labelers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal’s purpose is primarily to acquire talent, aka an acqui-hire, adding nine key Cleanlab employees to Handshake’s research organization. This includes the startup’s co-founders, who earned their PhDs in computer science from MIT: Curtis Northcutt (pictured above), Jonas Mueller, and Anish Athalye. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed (though, as we previously reported, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/18/selling-a-startup-in-an-acqui-hire-is-more-lucrative-than-it-seems-founders-and-vcs-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sometimes an acqui-hire can be surprisingly lucrative</a> for founders.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cleanlab has raised a total of $30 million from investors, including Menlo Ventures, TQ Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Databricks Ventures. At its peak, the startup had more than 30 employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cleanlab’s researchers are experts in developing algorithms that flag incorrect data without a second human reviewer. The goal is to improve the quality of the data Handshake produces for AI labs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have an in-house research team that thinks a lot about where our models are weak, what data should we be producing? How high quality is that data?” Sahil Bhaiwala, chief strategy and innovation officer at Handshake told TechCrunch. “The Cleanlab team has been focusing on this problem for years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Northcutt, the Cleanlab CEO who’s credited with pioneering its automated data-labeling auditing, said the company received acquisition interest from other AI data-labeling companies. But the startup chose to sell to Handshake because, he said, data-labeling competitors, including Mercor, Surge, and Scale AI, frequently use Handshake’s platform to source human experts such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists for their data-labeling projects.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re going to pick one, you should probably pick the source, not the middleman,” Northcutt told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Handshake, which was last valued at $3.3 billion in 2022, was forecasted to end 2025 at $300 million in annualized revenue run rate (ARR) and is <a href=\"https://www.upstartsmedia.com/p/handshake-refounding-layoff-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> on track to reach an ARR of “high hundreds of millions” this year.
