            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/69630fa9-02d4-8012-8ef2-84c443c04922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chain of thought</a> is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Legendre’s formula</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bertrand’s postulate</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David_theorem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Star of David theorum</a>. Eventually, the model found <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/138209/product-of-central-binomial-coefficients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Math Overflow post from 2013</a>, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Somani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over one thousand conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.erdosproblems.com/\">maintained online</a>. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve</a> — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contributions-to-Erd%C5%91s-problems\">on his GitHub page</a>, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115891257393270694\">On Mastodon</a>, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another driving force is a recent shift towards formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open-source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Liftoff Mobile <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1850351/000119312526011825/iron-20260113.htm#principal_and_selling\">filed</a> its first S-1 document late Tuesday, the first step in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company isn’t yet discussing how big this IPO will be: it has not yet filled in any data yet about the size of the offering or the stakes held by its principal shareholders. However, the IPO research firm <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/116132/Advertising-mobile-app-software-Liftoff-Mobile-files-for-an-estimated-$400-\">Renaissance Capital</a> reports the whisper number at $400 million, meaning that’s what the street thinks the company hopes to raise.<br><br>The company offers a platform that helps mobile app developers market their apps and was formed in 2021 through a merger of Liftoff and Vungle. Blackstone acquired the majority of its shares at the time and the finance giant also appointed new leadership, meaning it is no longer a founder-run company. After the offering, Blackstone will remain the majority shareholder, according to the S-1 filing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another interesting tidbit: This listing, despite its relatively small expected size, has an unusually large number of bankers underwriting it. The offering has three joint lead bankers (Goldman, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley) and another 12 banks assisting to sell, plus three other financial institutions, including Blackstone, involved. Whew! That could either be a sign of strong investor interest or the need to spread risk across many institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liftoff claims 140,000 apps use its services. It says it had 2025 revenues of over $519 million and a net loss of just over $48 million. The company also says it is carrying over $1.85 billion in debt.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

It could also do other things, like require that people who join a product-focused community verify they actually own or use the product being discussed there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an example, a community for Oura ring owners could verify that everyone who posts has proven they own one of the smart rings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, Rose suggests Digg could use signals acquired from mobile devices to help verify members — for instance, the app could identify when Digg users attended a meetup in the same location.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think there’s going to be any one silver bullet here,” said Rose. “It’s just going to be us saying … here’s a platter of things that you can add together to create trust.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before today’s public beta launch, the site offered 21 more generalized communities like gaming, technology, and entertainment, and was open to 67,000 users on an invite-only basis. Now anyone will be able to join and start their own communities on nearly any topic, no matter how niche — a top request from beta testers. The community managers (i.e., moderators) for these individual forums will be able to set their own rules, and their moderation logs will be shared publicly, so members can see what decisions are being made.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082654\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg 2796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=1200,663 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=1280,707 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=430,237 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=720,398 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=900,497 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=800,442 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1131 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=668,369 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=1117,617 1117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=708,391 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-12.12.25-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Digg (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The site has also been redesigned since its private beta, now offering a new sidebar where you can pin your favorite communities and a main feed optimized for visual elements. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, communities will only have one manager, but that will change in time, as the company adds more features, including those to customize the look and feel and functionality of individual communities with integrations and other tools.

Plans on this front haven’t been fleshed out yet, however, but Mezzell said it “has to be a conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to figure out a way to make this an equitable experience for everybody who’s actually building Digg into what it needs to become,” he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the team is considering shifting its AI-created podcast about the interesting stories surfacing on Digg into a human-hosted version, as users have been requesting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rose told TechCrunch that the current team is small, giving them “years of runway” to find product-market fit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The beautiful thing about this launch is we’re finally at the place with Digg where it’s just that the foundational stuff is done, and now we can really start having fun,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new Gemini experience streamlines much of the manual work involved in exploring trending topics, reducing research time, and surfacing connections that users might otherwise overlook.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The redesigned Explore page now features a side panel that automatically identifies and compares relevant trends in your area of interest.

The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings.

AI music now sounds real enough that it can be difficult to decipher how it was made.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one high-profile example, Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&amp;B song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">How Was I Supposed To Know</a>.” Her AI “persona,” Xania Monet, received multiple bids for record deals before signing with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The legality of AI-generated music is up in the air. Suno is currently facing <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/labels-fire-back-at-sunos-attempt-to-dismiss-youtube-stream-ripping-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lawsuits</a> from major labels Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, which allege the company trained its AI on copyrighted material from the labels.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This hasn’t deterred Silicon Valley, though. Suno raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/legally-embattled-ai-music-startup-suno-raises-at-2-45b-valuation-on-200m-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$250 million Series C</a> round in November, which valued the company at $2.4 billion. While the raise was led by Menlo Ventures, Suno saw participation from Hallwood Media, the company backing Xania Monet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The legal outlook doesn’t look good for artists. In a recent lawsuit, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a judge ruled</a> that Anthropic could use copyrighted books that it downloaded illegally to train its AI. What was illegal, the judge said, was that Anthropic pirated the books that it fed into its AI models. The company got a $1.5 billion slap on the wrist, which isn’t very significant for a company that’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13b-series-f-at-183b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">valued</a> at $183 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike Spotify or Apple Music, Bandcamp doesn’t pay artists per stream. Instead, Bandcamp allows artists to sell their music digitally alongside physical products like merch and CDs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bandcamp only makes money from its cut of artists’ sales — but even if it presents itself as an artist-first distributor, a tech company is still a tech company, and the bottom line matters. Looking at Bandcamp’s move optimistically, perhaps the company is confirming what artists hope to be true: No one is actually spending money to buy AI-generated music, at least not on Bandcamp.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Type One is also in the midst of raising a $250 million Series B at a $900 million pre-money valuation, according to sources and later confirmed by the company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other energy startups, Type One has benefited from a surge in demand from data centers and the broader electrification of the economy. Data centers are expected to use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nearly three times more electricity</a> by 2035, while overall electricity demand is forecast to grow by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/global-electricity-demand-expected-to-grow-4-annually-through-2027/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">4% annually</a> through next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion power could deliver gigawatts’ worth of nearly limitless clean power. The reactors work by fusing atoms, which release tremendous amounts of heat and energy in the process. Power plants harvest that heat to spin turbines, similar to today’s fossil fuel facilities, but without the pollution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike fission, fusion reactors don’t produce significant amounts of radioactive waste. They also don’t pose a risk of catastrophic meltdowns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are two main approaches to fusion power: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. In the former, magnets compress and control plasma, the superheated particles that ultimately fuse into new atoms. In the latter, fuel pellets are compressed until they fuse, most often using lasers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Type One will employ magnetic confinement, and the design is what’s known as a stellarator. In a stellarator, magnets are arranged in a doughnut shape that’s twisted and turned according to the demands of the plasma. Previously built stellarators have been able to control plasma for long periods of time, though none have been built yet with the intention of producing power.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Type One signed deals with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to place the startup’s first commercial power plant at the site of the former Bull Run Fossil Plant, a coal-fired power plant that was retired in 2023.

Google says this means Gemini understands context without being told where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant notes that this beta experience, called Personal Intelligence, is off by default, as users have the option to choose if and when they want to connect their Google apps to Gemini. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and YouTube history. If you do decide to connect your apps, Gemini will only use Personal Intelligence when it determines that doing so will be helpful, Google says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Personal Intelligence has two core strengths: reasoning across complex sources and retrieving specific details from, say, an email or photo to answer your question,” wrote Josh Woodward, VP, Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio, in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/personal-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “It often combines these, working across text, photos and video to provide uniquely tailored answers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Woodward shared an example of when he was standing in line at a tire shop and didn’t remember his car’s tire size. While most AI chatbots can determine a car’s tire size, Woodward says Gemini can go further by offering personalized responses. In his case, Gemini suggested all-weather tires after identifying family road trip photos in Google Photos. Woodward also said he forgot his license plate number, but Gemini was able to pull the number from a picture in Photos. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082592\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Personal-Intelligence_Onboarding.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve also been getting excellent tips for books, shows, clothes and travel,” Woodward wrote. “Just this week, it’s been exceptional for planning our upcoming spring break. By analyzing our family’s interests and past trips in Gmail and Photos, it skipped the tourist traps. Instead, it suggested an overnight train journey and specific board games we could play along the way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says it has guardrails for sensitive topics, as Gemini will avoid making proactive assumptions about sensitive data like health. However, the tech giant also notes that Gemini will discuss this data if you ask it to. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Gemini doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts in Gemini and the model’s responses. In the examples above, the photos of the road trip, the license plate picture in Photos, and the emails in Gmail are not directly used to train the model. They are only referenced to generate a response, Google says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Personal Intelligence is rolling out to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Google plans to expand the feature to more countries and Gemini’s free tier. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google provided a list of example prompts to try, including “Help me plan my weekend in [city i.e. New York] based on things I like to do,” “Recommend some documentaries based on what I’ve been curious about,” or “Based on my delivery and grocery receipts in Gmail, Search history, and YouTube watch history, recommend 5 YouTube channels that match my cooking style or meal prep vibe.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At the same time, cyber defenders are also turning to the technology to fight back. <a href=\"https://depthfirst.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Depthfirst</a>, a security startup positioning itself at the forefront of this AI-powered defense, announced Wednesday that it had raised $40 million in a Series A round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in October 2024, the company raised the round from Accel Partners, which led the investment, with participation from SV Angel, Mantis VC, and Alt Capital.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Depthfirst offers a platform called General Security Intelligence, an AI-native suite that helps companies scan and analyze their codebases and workflows for signs of trouble. The company says that the platform also allows companies to protect themselves from credential exposures and to monitor threats to their open source and third-party components.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use the new capital to hire additional staff for applied research and engineering, as well as product and sales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve entered an era where software is written faster than it can be secured,” said Qasim Mithani, the company’s co-founder and CEO, as part of the announcement. Mithani, who previously worked for Databricks and Amazon, added that automation has changed how bad actors execute their attacks. “AI has already changed how attackers work. Defense has to evolve just as fundamentally.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s leadership comes with backgrounds in both AI and security. One of depthfirst’s other co-founders, Daniele Perito, previously served as director of security and risk engineering at Square, which is part of Jack Dorsey’s Block. Its CTO (and another co-founder), Andrea Michi, was previously an engineer at Google DeepMind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just as AI can be used for legitimate purposes, it can also be used by cybercriminals to automate a whole range of malicious processes — from writing malware to social engineering attacks to scanning for vulnerabilities to exploit.

The researchers say they have seen elaborate hacks targeting logistics companies to hijack and redirect large amounts of their customers’ products into the hands of criminals, in what has become an alarming collusion between hackers and real-life organized crime gangs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-10/hijackers-stole-a-delivery-truck-after-hack-spotlighting-uptick-in-cargo-theft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delivery truck of stolen vapes</a> here, a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/12/29/lobster-stolen-massachusetts-warehouse/87950372007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suspected lobster heist</a> there.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One little-known and critical U.S. shipping tech company has spent the last few months patching its own systems following the discovery of a raft of simple vulnerabilities, which inadvertently left the doors to its shipping platform wide open to anyone on the internet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is Bluspark Global, a New York-based firm whose shipping and supply chain platform, Bluvoyix, allows hundreds of big companies to transport their products and track their cargo as it travels across the globe. While Bluspark may not be a household name, the company helps to power a large slice of worldwide freight shipments, including retail giants, grocery stores, furniture makers, and more. The company’s software is also used by several other companies affiliated with Bluspark.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluspark told TechCrunch this week that its security issues are now resolved. The company fixed five flaws in its platform, including the use of plaintext passwords by employees and customers, and the ability to remotely access and interact with Bluvoyix’s shipping software. The flaws exposed access to all of the customer’s data, including their shipment records, dating back decades. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But for security researcher Eaton Zveare, who uncovered the vulnerabilities in Bluspark’s systems back in October, alerting the company to the security flaws took longer than the discovery of the bugs themselves — since Bluspark had no discernable way to contact it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a now-published <a href=\"https://eaton-works.com/2026/01/14/bluspark-bluvoyix-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>, Zveare said he submitted details of the five flaws in Bluspark’s platform to the <a href=\"https://maritimehackingvillage.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Maritime Hacking Village</a>, a nonprofit that works to secure maritime space and, as with this case, helps researchers to notify companies working in the maritime industry of active security flaws. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Weeks later, and following multiple emails, voicemails, and LinkedIn messages, the company had not responded to Zveare. All the while, the flaws could still be exploited by anyone on the internet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a last resort, Zveare contacted TechCrunch in an effort to get the issues flagged. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch sent emails to Bluspark CEO Ken O’Brien and the company’s senior leadership alerting them to a security lapse, but did not receive a response. TechCrunch later emailed a Bluspark customer, a U.S. publicly traded retail company, to alert them of the upstream security lapse, but we also did not hear back.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the third time TechCrunch emailed Bluspark’s CEO, we included a partial copy of his password to demonstrate the seriousness of the security lapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A couple of hours later, TechCrunch received a response — from a law firm representing Bluspark. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-plaintext-passwords-and-an-unauthenticated-api\">Plaintext passwords and an unauthenticated API</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his blog post, Zveare explained he initially discovered the vulnerabilities after visiting the website of a Bluspark customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare wrote that the customer’s website had a contact form that allowed prospective customers to make inquiries. By viewing the web page source code with his browser’s built-in tools, Zveare noticed the form would send the customer’s message through Bluspark’s servers via its API. (An API allows two or more connected systems to communicate with each other over the internet; in this case, a website contact form and the Bluspark customer’s inbox.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the email-sending code was embedded in the web page itself, this meant it was possible for anyone to modify the code and abuse this form to <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">send malicious emails</a>, such as phishing lures, originating from a real Bluspark customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare pasted the API’s web address into his browser, which loaded a page containing the API’s auto-generated documentation. This web page was a <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">master list</a> of all the actions that can be performed with the company’s API, such as requesting a list of users who have access to Bluspark’s platforms, as well as creating new user accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The API documentation page also had a feature allowing anyone the ability to “test” the API by submitting commands to retrieve data from Bluspark’s servers as a logged-in user. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare found that the API, despite the page claiming that it required authentication to use, <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22236\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">did not need a password</a> or any credentials to return sensitive information from Bluspark’s servers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using only the list of API commands, Zveare was able to retrieve reams of user account records of employees and customers who use Bluspark’s platform, entirely unauthenticated. This included usernames and passwords, which were <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">visible in plaintext</a> and not encrypted — including an account associated with the platform’s administrator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the admin’s username and password in hand, an attacker could have logged into this account and run amok. As a good-faith security researcher, Zveare could not use the credentials, as using someone else’s password without their permission is unlawful. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the API documentation listed a command that allowed anyone to <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-22238\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">create a new user</a> with administrator access, Zveare went ahead and did just that, and got unrestricted access to its Bluvoyix supply chain platform. Zveare said the administrator’s level of access allowed the viewing of customer data as far back as 2007.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare found that once logged in with this newly created user, each API request was wrapped in a user-specific token, which was meant to ensure the user was in fact allowed to access a portal page each time they clicked on a link. But the token was not necessary to complete the command, allowing Zveare to send requests without the token altogether, further confirming that the API was unauthenticated. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bugs-fixed-company-plans-new-security-policy\">Bugs fixed, company plans new security policy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After establishing contact with Bluspark’s law firm, Zveare gave TechCrunch permission to share a copy of his vulnerability report with its representatives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Days later, the law firm said Bluspark had remediated most of the flaws and was working to retain a third-party company for an independent assessment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zveare’s efforts to disclose the bugs highlight a common problem in the cybersecurity world. Companies oftentimes do not provide a way, such as a publicly listed email address, to alert them about security vulnerabilities. As such, this can make it challenging for security researchers to publicly reveal security flaws that remain active, out of concerns that disclosing details could put users’ data at risk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ming Lee, an attorney representing Bluspark, told TechCrunch on Tuesday the company is “confident in the steps taken to mitigate potential risk arising from the researcher’s findings,” but would not comment on specifics of the vulnerabilities or their fixes; say which third-party assessment company it retained, if any; or comment on its specific security practices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked by TechCrunch, Bluspark would not say if it was able to ascertain if any of its customer shipments had been manipulated by someone maliciously exploiting the bugs. Lee said there was “no indication of customer impact or malicious activity attributable to the issues identified by the researcher.” Bluspark would not say what evidence it had to reach that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lee said Bluspark was planning to introduce a disclosure program, allowing outside security researchers to report bugs and flaws to the company, but that its discussions were still underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluspark CEO Ken O’Brien did not provide comment for this article.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>To securely contact this reporter, you can reach out using Signal via the username: zackwhittaker.1337</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These features are also available for adults, who can opt to set their own limits and reminders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For parents who also use YouTube, it can be challenging to move back and forth between an adult’s account and kid’s account — unless if you want your algorithm to be forever usurped by Bluey.

Going forward, the only way to access the feature will be through a monthly subscription.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change represents a major break from how Tesla has sold access to the advanced driver assistance suite over the years. It’s also a decision that could have an impact on Tesla’s bottom line, Musk’s ability to unlock the full value of his $1 trillion pay package, and the company’s ever-swirling legal troubles. And it comes as many other global automakers are making progress on their own advanced driver assistance systems in hopes of competing with Tesla. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has sold access to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software suite — which still does not make a car completely autonomous, and requires human supervision — at various price points over the years. The upfront price peaked at $15,000 in 2022, though more recently the company has been charging customers $8,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla started offering access to the software via a $199-per-month <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">subscription in 2021</a>, and it dropped that price to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/tesla-drops-fsd-price-to-99-per-month-in-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">just $99-per-month in 2024</a>. Musk often encouraged customers to pay the upfront price, though, as he claimed the cost of FSD would increase dramatically as Tesla added to its capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But on Wednesday, Musk wrote in a post on X that Tesla will stop selling FSD outright starting on February 14. He didn’t say whether Tesla plans to change the pricing structure for the subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also did not offer an explanation for the change, but there are a few possible reasons. Musk and other Tesla executives have spoken publicly about how the adoption rate is lower than they had hoped. In October 2025, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-full-self-driving-sales-customers-pay-fsd-2025-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> only 12% of all Tesla customers have paid for FSD. Shifting to a subscription-only model with a lower upfront cost could help boost those numbers, especially during a first quarter that is expected to be rough for Tesla.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boosting subscriptions would also get Musk closer to fulfilling one of the key “product goals” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/06/musks-1t-pay-package-is-full-of-watered-down-versions-of-his-own-broken-promises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">required for him to receive the full payout</a> of his new $1 trillion pay package. The company has tasked him with, among other things, reaching “10 million active FSD subscriptions” (measured daily over a three-month period) before late 2035.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moving to a subscription-only model could also be a legal hedge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For a decade, Musk and Tesla promoted the idea that customers were buying cars that had all the hardware required to become autonomous vehicles, and that all the company needed to do was improve the software. But that was not true: Tesla has had to make a number of upgrades inside its vehicles in the years since, and Musk himself has said that a huge portion of existing owners (those with so-called “Hardware 3” vehicles) would likely need new hardware in their cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FSD was sold under this same promise. Customers who bought the software outright would eventually get a software update that would make their cars full autonomous. Tesla has still not fulfilled that promise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla currently faces all kinds of legal trouble related to these unmet promises. In December, a judge ruled that the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-marketing-for-autopilot-and-full-self-driving-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">engaged in deceptive marketing</a> around FSD (and its less-capable system, Autopilot) and ordered the California DMV (which brought the case) to suspend Tesla’s manufacturing and dealer licenses in the state for 30 days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV stayed the order and gave Tesla at least 60 days to comply by changing the names of those products, or ship software that delivers on the promise. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla also faces a range of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/tesla-drivers-can-pursue-class-action-over-self-driving-claims-judge-rules-2025-08-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">class action</a> lawsuits over the claims it made about the future autonomous capabilities of its vehicles. By removing the option to buy FSD outright, the company could be capping any potential liabilities in those lawsuits should they proceed to trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s FSD is still regarded as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-for-traffic-safety-violations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most capable driver-assistance software</a> on the market in the U.S. But the company’s success hasn’t stopped competitors from trying to develop their own systems. Rivian recently detailed its own efforts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">release FSD-like driver assistance software</a>, starting with a major <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/rivian-rolls-out-new-universal-hands-free-driving-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">geographic expansion</a> to its hands-free driving feature. Ford and General Motors have their own hands-free systems. And the many rival automakers Tesla competes with in China have been developing their own solutions, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/why-chinas-auto-tech-giants-threaten-teslas-self-driving-future-2025-06-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some even offering their driver assistance features as a standard option</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Other agents were being made by companies that had the time and resources to spend months building specialized tools. “Developers and enterprises needed an alternative,” Leonard told TechCrunch, adding that he and Caneja also realized that the future of software would be “coded, validated, and optimized by coding agents.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These two insights and a historical realization gave us the inspiration for VoiceRun,” Leonard, the company’s CEO, said. Caneja is the company’s CTO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, they decided to launch <a href=\"https://voicerun.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">VoiceRun, a platform</a> that lets developers and coding assistants launch and scale voice agents. Right now, many of these low-code platforms let people build voice agents with visual diagrams, where people click through conversation flows and write prompts into boxes that then dictate how the agent should behave. All of that can be hard to manage, Leonard said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">VoiceRun, on the other hand, lets users code how they want their voice agents to behave, giving them more flexibility in creating the product they want. Code is the native language of coding agents, Leonard explained. “They are going to do a far better job operating in code than in a visual interface,” Leonard said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Furthermore, with visuals, there are limited configuration options, so if someone wanted to build a voice agent that could speak in a different dialect, it might be harder to do if the maker of the visual interface didn’t build a feature that can handle that task.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But in code, it’s incredibly simple to do,” he said. “There is a long tail of millions of examples of little things you might want to do that aren’t supported by the visual interface.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from coding agents, VoiceRun also lets users perform A/B testing and deploy instantly with one click. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is geared toward enterprise developers, helping companies, for example, incorporate AI into their customer services, or helping tech companies launch voice-based products. He mentioned working with a restaurant-tech company launching an AI phone concierge for food reservations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced on Wednesday the closing of a $5.5 million seed round led by Flybridge Capital. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a lot of competition in the AI agent space. Startups in this area last year nabbed billions of dollars (out of the many billions that flooded into AI companies in general). Leonard feels his company is up against two ends of the market: There are the no-code voice builders, like Bland and Retell AI, he said, that let users build quick demos. There are also more sophisticated tools, like LiveKit and Pipecat, which give developers “maximum control.” He feels VoiceRun sits in the middle of these two ends. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“​​We provide global voice infrastructure and an evaluation-driven lifecycle, while keeping ownership of business logic code and data in the customers’ hands,” he said. “The key difference is that we are closing the loop for end-to-end coding agent development. We expect developers to be supervising coding agents that write code, run tests, deploy, and propose improvements.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some ways, Leonard is hoping his product helps developers create voice agent tools that will, in turn, help people feel more comfortable with automated voices. Customers today “feel relief” when a human answers the phone, “because voice automation has been brittle and ineffective.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A survey from Five9 <a href=\"https://www.five9.com/news/news-releases/new-five9-study-finds-75-consumers-prefer-talking-human-customer-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last year showed </a>that three-fourths of its survey respondents still prefer talking to a human when it comes to customer service matters. Leonard said he wants to change this perception because “human agents today have their own limitations,” like language barriers or making people feel judged. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There were great cars before the Model T, but vehicles didn’t become ubiquitous until the assembly line,” Leonard said. “There are great voice agents today, but they won’t be ubiquitous until the voice agent factory is built. VoiceRun is that factory.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Other investors included DNV Ventures (the investment arm of 160-year-old maritime company DNV), Beyond Earth Ventures (a space-focused firm), and TFX Capital (which has made a number of defense-related space investments).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fischer said he and co-founder Bill Perkins — who comes from the hedge fund world, hence the emphasis on generating actionable insights — initially only sought to raise a round of about $8 million. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But 2025 was a record year for <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/2025-vertical-snapshot-defense-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">defense-related investments</a>, and SkyFi received more investor demand than expected, Fischer said. The company upped its target to $10 million, and again to $12 million, before arriving at the $12.7 million figure after some strategic investors joined the round. (One was DNV; Fischer declined to name the other on the record.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fischer said SkyFi used to have a harder time convincing satellite imagery providers to hand over access to their data. Now, he said, onboarding new providers is “table stakes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It took a little bit for us to get to this point, [but] we have the largest virtual constellation of assets. That means we have all the data supply in the world for us, all the different sensor types,” he said. SkyFi has been able to leverage all of that data and, crucially, the many requests it’s received from customers over the last few years to build up analytical offerings worth selling to commercial and government customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know better than anyone what they’re asking for,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fischer said he learned firsthand how powerful this kind of feedback loop can be from his time helping lead Uber’s Elevate division.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Uber has data on where people move in the world. They layer different products, the bikes, the scooters, the electric aircraft, the drone delivery. We have that equivalent data on what people are looking at in the world they’re asking of that data,” he said. “It gives us a much better purview. And again. We’re software first, so I don’t have the burden of having to pay for hardware capital expenses.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of those customers will want to do their own analytics, like the hedge funds, Fischer explained. But most are increasingly interested in what SkyFi has to offer on the insights side, he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use the new funding to expand on all this, though Fischer is clearly proud of building a product that is deeply capable but inherently approachable, to the point that even his family uses the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My teenage daughters task satellites for their high school, and now college, homework on their iPhones,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, there are some hints contained <a href=\"https://digital.ny.gov/state-of-the-state-book-2026/#table-contents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">within a document</a> that outlines an array of proposals and promises Hochul made in her State of the State address. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among them is language to expand the state’s existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document goes on to say companies that want to operate robotaxi services commercially will have to submit applications that “demonstrate local support for AV deployment and adherence to the highest possible safety standards.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear what “limited deployment” or “highest possible safety standards” mean. Nor does the document outline how the state will track or make judgments on a company’s safety record, except that multiple agencies will be involved, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Transportation, and New York State Police.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The governor’s office told TechCrunch more will be shared in the governor’s executive budget proposal that is set to be released on January 20.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the remarks were enough of an opening to make Alphabet-owned Waymo cheer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Governor Hochul’s proposal to legalize fully autonomous vehicles is a transformative moment for New York’s transportation system,” Justin Kintz, Waymo’s head of global public policy, said in an emailed statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With the Governor’s leadership, New York has the opportunity to pair its investments in slower speeds, better traffic enforcement, and first-in-the-nation congestion management strategies with Waymo’s demonstrably safe technology, creating a future where living in New York is safer, easier, and more accessible. We’re ready to work with leaders around the state to make this future a reality, and bring new infrastructure, career opportunities, and investment to the Empire State,” said Kintz.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo and other companies have tried for years to enter New York state with limited success. Current New York state law mandates that drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That poses a problem for robotaxi operators like Waymo since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The state’s AV pilot program has provided an exemption to that rule, theoretically allowing companies to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, there are significant hurdles, particularly in New York City. Last August, city regulators granted a permit to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the densely populated city. Under that permit, Waymo can deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn with a human safety operator behind the wheel. A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the permit has been extended until March 31.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even with the permit, Waymo can’t carry passengers or operate a commercial robotaxi service without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S2688#:~:text=2025%2DS2688%20(ACTIVE)%20%2D%20Summary,the%20operation%20of%20autonomous%20taxicabs.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legislation was introduced</a> last year to create a framework for driverless operation, it has languished in the state Senate’s transportation committee. The governor’s proposal could help loosen that bottleneck. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-launching-its-own-ai-infrastructure-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said that</a> Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spend billions to expand its AI capacity</a>. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/ai-data-centers-accused-creating-160043558.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">accused</a> of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/data-center-water-pollution-amazon-oregon-1235466613/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">environmental concerns</a>. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/nx-s1-5355017/data-centers-bring-money-to-small-towns-but-do-they-also-bring-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">questions around</a> the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">observed</a> that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company <a href=\"https://www.wisn.com/article/microsoft-drops-caledonia-data-center-after-community-pushback/68905827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">abandoned plans</a> for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township <a href=\"https://arcwestmichigan.com/news/local/microsoft-data-center-proposal-protest-processing-information-farm-life-community-dorr-township-allegan-county-west-michigan-infrastructure-development?photo=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have recently inspired locals</a> to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ohio-public-pays-price-big-093003806.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an op-ed</a> in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/communities/americas/ohio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">developing</a> several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-microsoft-make-changes-curb-data-center-power-costs-americans-2026-01-13/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">major changes</a>” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/trump-and-microsoft-laud-data-center-commitments-as-key-to-addressing-electricity-prices-3961528c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqd6_IWdHe0kYQxoYNNXC8LJ6OhCRB1wooYoTn3g0mEr5jkfi-TPWnfCGJ4il3o%3D&amp;gaa_ts=696693bf&amp;gaa_sig=J5QMFBFOx4fuMfYlhc-Qz7ayNiiB1exUqCNVBwv49p1En7-QYRza3SWBl7M-STYc1__FRng2NKm8Uuo3mMeOhQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trump said</a> the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank <a href=\"https://groundworkcollaborative.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Groundwork Collaborative</a>. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as <a href=\"https://x.com/owenslindsay1/status/2010764260423729309\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">well as delving into some</a> of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which <a href=\"https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/message-ceo/nrf-2026-remarks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google CEO Sundar Pichai described</a> when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a post on X, Google <a href=\"https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010852970859270341\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">responded that</a>, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents <a href=\"https://ucp.dev/specification/identity-linking/#mapping-between-resources-actions-and-capabilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on handling a shopper’s identity</a> say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">Google to change a number of search business practices</a> after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like <a href=\"https://dupe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dupe</a>, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and <a href=\"https://www.joinbeni.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Beni</a>, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Investors include Air Liquide’s venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, MOL Switch, and Shell Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the startup succeeds, it could pave the way for ammonia to be used beyond fertilizer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammonia is viewed by some as an alternative to hydrogen to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/amogy-raises-80m-to-power-ships-and-data-centers-with-ammonia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decarbonize a range of industries</a>. Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/business/petrochemicals/ammonia-fuel-future/99/i8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as energy dense</a> and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH<sub>4</sub>) found in natural gas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate <a href=\"https://www.c-thru.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ammonia-Technical-Brief-June2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">between 1,000 and 3,000 tons</a> per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250270101A1/en?assignee=Ammobia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">patent pending</a> on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.5c00899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">manganese nitride</a>, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/amazons-ring-doorbells-get-fire-alerts-an-app-store-and-new-sensors/\">shipped</a> just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/amazons-new-alexa-feature-adds-conversational-ai-to-ring-doorbells/\">conversational AI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">facial recognition</a> features, and more. Some of these additions have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">not been without controversy</a>, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2023, five years after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/amazon-is-buying-smart-doorbell-maker-ring/\">selling Ring to Amazon</a>, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/amazon-ring-ceo-steps-down-five-years-after-acquisition.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">needed out</a>. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082346\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg 3777w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ring-watch-duty-jamie-siminoff-garage-burned-palisades-fire-la-2026-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">destroying the garage where Ring was built</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of Ring’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/amazons-ring-doorbells-get-fire-alerts-an-app-store-and-new-sensors/\">new additions, Fire Watch</a>, was inspired by this tragedy.

In 2024, Ring <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/ring-will-stop-sharing-video-with-police-with-some-exceptions-heres-what-it-means-for-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ended</a> an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/security/amazons-ring-cameras-push-deeper-into-police-and-government-surveillance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">companies like Flock Safety and Axon,</a> which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose.

This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance.

That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082347\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg 4234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=322,430 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/852890/ring-mobile-security-elite-camera-ces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mounted cameras</a>, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2026/ring-around-the-parking-lot-amazons-security-tech-goes-commercial-with-a-5k-surveillance-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">trailer</a>, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
