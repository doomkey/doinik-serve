The voluntary recall of its software affected 332 vehicles, <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCLRPT-25E090-1680.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to documents</a> filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there have not been any collisions associated with the issue, Zoox noted in the NHTSA filing that it could increase the risk of a crash. The company provides free rides to the public in its <a href=\"https://zoox.com/where-to-ride/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">driverless Zoox vehicles</a> in parts of San Francisco and Las Vegas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Zoox spokesperson told TechCrunch the company identified some instances in which its vehicles made maneuvers that, while common for human drivers, didn’t meet its standards. For example, in an effort to avoid blocking certain intersections at a red light, the robotaxi might stop in a crosswalk. In other instances, the robotaxi made a late turn, resulting in a wide turn, according to a spokesperson’s emailed statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue was initially identified on August 26 when a Zoox robotaxi made a wide right turn, crossed partially into the opposing travel lane, and temporarily stopped in front of the oncoming travel lane, according to the NHTSA filing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox monitored its data for additional lane crossings near intersections, ultimately identifying 62 instances between August 26 and December 5. The company said in the filing it was in “ongoing conversations with NHTSA about the frequency, severity, and root causes of these occurrences.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company updated its software on November 7 and again in mid-December to address all of the issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have successfully identified and deployed targeted software improvements to address the root causes of these incidents,” the statement reads. “Today, we’re submitting a voluntary software recall because transparency and safety is foundational to Zoox, and we want to be open with the public and regulators about how we are constantly refining and improving our technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software recall affected Zoox vehicles operating on public roads between March 13 and December 18, according to the filing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zoox has issued several software recalls this year, including one in March to address <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/zoox-recalls-258-self-driving-cars-over-unexpected-braking/\">unexpected hard braking</a>. That recall followed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/feds-tell-zoox-to-send-more-info-about-autonomous-vehicles-suddenly-braking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">preliminary investigation</a> by NHTSA that was opened after the agency received two reports of motorcyclists colliding with the back of Zoox vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In May, Zoox filed two software recalls to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/zoox-issues-second-robotaxi-software-recall-in-a-month-following-collision/\">address concerns</a> about the system’s ability to predict the movement of other road users. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The biggest hack by far was the breach at Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit, where <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/crypto-exchange-bybit-says-it-was-hacked-and-lost-around-1-4-billion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hackers stole around $1.4 billion</a> in crypto. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/researchers-accuse-north-korea-of-1-4-billion-bybit-crypto-heist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blockchain analysis firms</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/fbi-says-north-korea-responsible-for-1-4-billion-bybit-heist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FBI</a>, accused North Korean government hackers — the most prolific group targeting crypto in the last few years — of this massive heist.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was the largest known loot of crypto of all time, and one of the largest financial heists in the history of humanity. Before the Bybit hack, the largest crypto thefts netted $624 million and $611 million for hackers in the 2022 breaches against the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/15/us-officials-link-north-korean-lazarus-hackers-to-625m-axie-infinity-crypto-theft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ronin Network</a> and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/29/axie-infinitys-ronin-network-suffers-%E2%89%88625m-exploit-in-largest-defi-hack-to-date/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Poly Network</a>, respectively. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cryptocurrency-monitoring firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs both estimated a total of $2.7 billion stolen in crypto in 2025, per data shared with TechCrunch. Chainalysis also tracked another $700,000 stolen from individual crypto wallets, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">De.Fi, the web3 security firm running the <a href=\"https://de.fi/rekt-database\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">REKT database</a> that tracks crypto thefts, also estimated $2.7 billion in stolen and hacked crypto last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As usual, North Korean government hackers were the most successful crypto thieves throughout 2025, after stealing at least $2 billion, according to Chainalysis and Elliptic, which estimated that Kim Jong Un’s hackers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/north-korean-hackers-stole-over-2-billion-in-crypto-so-far-in-2025-researchers-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">have stolen around $6 billion since 2017</a>. North Korea uses crypto thefts to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other significant crypto hacks this year included the one against <a href=\"https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-cetus-hack-may-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cetus</a>, a decentralized exchange, which netted the hackers $223 million; the breach against <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/how-an-attacker-drained-128m-from-balancer-through-rounding-error-exploitation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Balancer</a>, a protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in a loss of $128 million; and the one against the crypto exchange <a href=\"https://phemex.com/announcements/phemex-hot-wallet-security-incident-update-and-timeline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Phemex</a>, where cybercriminals stole more than $73 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cybercriminals targeting crypto exchanges and other DeFi projects are not slowing down.

His dad built homes for major developers, and his mom sold to big-box builders across the East Coast. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Donahue was particularly interested in why designing a custom home cost a fortune and took forever, and why most people had to settle for whatever the developers were offering that year. So when he dropped out of NC State and moved to the Bay Area, he eventually did what you might expect a college dropout to do in San Francisco: He started a company to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That effort, Atmos, went through Y Combinator, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/yc-khosla-backed-atmos-lands-12-5m-to-help-people-design-their-dream-homes-real-estate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $20 million</a> from investors like Khosla Ventures and Sam Altman, and tried to use tech to streamline the custom home design process. It had designers on staff who worked with clients while software handled the back end. It grew to 40 people and $7 million in revenue, and they designed $200 million worth of houses and built 50.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All that sounds great until you hear Donahue describe it. “It became this extremely operational business,” he told me on a Zoom call last week. “Kind of like a glamorized architecture firm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It never quite replaced the humans, in other words. Then the Federal Reserve started jacking up interest rates, and suddenly clients who’d spent months designing their dream homes couldn’t afford them anymore. Nine months ago, Donahue shut it down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s where most founders would take a break, maybe write a few LinkedIn posts about what they learned. Instead, Donahue regrouped and started another company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.drafted.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Drafted</a> is now nearly five months old, and it’s everything Atmos wasn’t. No designers on staff. No operational complexity. Just AI-driven software that generates residential floor plans and exterior designs in minutes. You tell it what you want — bedrooms, square footage, whatever — and it spits out five designs. Don’t like them? You can generate five more and keep going until something clicks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, Drafted has six employees, four from Atmos, and it’s raised $1.65 million at a $35 million post-money valuation from Bill Clerico, Stripe’s Patrick Collison, Jack Altman, Josh Buckley, and Warriors player Moses Moody.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clerico led the round because he’d also been an angel investor in Atmos and had watched Donahue will houses into existence despite rising interest rates. When Donahue told him about the new company over coffee, Clerico didn’t need convincing. “Nick, please take our money,” he apparently said repeatedly over a two-week period until Donahue agreed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pitch is straightforward. Right now, if you want a custom home, you’ve got two options: hire an architect (expensive, slow), or buy a template plan online (cheap, inflexible). Drafted sits in the middle, offering customization at template prices. A complete plan costs between $1,000 and $2,000. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The economics work because Drafted built its own AI model, trained on real house plans from homes that were built and passed permitting. Practical constraints are considered, and Donahue says the specialized model costs almost nothing to run: two-tenths of a penny per floor plan, compared to 13 cents for general-purpose AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Drafted only does single-story homes right now, but multi-story and lot-specific features are coming. The bigger question is whether there’s actually a market for this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers aren’t huge. Of the million new homes built in America each year, only 300,000 are custom designed. Most people buy existing homes or pick from whatever tract homes the big builders are offering. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clerico’s argument is that this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Make custom design cheap and fast enough, and many more people will do it. Donahue compares it to Uber, which didn’t just replace taxis but made on-demand car service something that nearly everyone uses. “There’s really no reason in the future why everyone shouldn’t have a totally custom-designed home,” Clerico says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or maybe most Americans will keep being price-conscious buyers who take what’s available. The housing market has a long track record of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/made-renovation-which-intrigued-then-infuriated-its-customers-is-shutting-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rebuffing disruption</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also the “moat” question. Asked what’s to keep an LLM player or even another vertical player from buying similar datasets and creating the same product, Donahue talks about brand, pointing to his friend David Holz, who founded the video and image generating AI outfit, Midjourney. Despite the plethora of new image-generation models being launched, Midjourney’s usage barely moves, Holz has told Donahue; its customers keep coming back to make AI images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Donahue thinks if they move fast enough and please enough customers, Drafted can become the place for people to design houses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Time will tell. Since opening to the public, the outfit has begun seeing about 1,000 daily users. Not huge numbers, but they show steady growth for such a young product.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Donahue has something pretty valuable that could give Drafted an edge: deep knowledge of a problem and the insights gleaned from taking a crack at it once already.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Pictured above, the Drafted crew, left to right: Martynas Pocius, Albert Chiu, Martina Cheru, Carson Poole, Stephen Chou, and Nick Donahue</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round was led by Forerunner’s Kirsten Green, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Greycroft, Offline Ventures, Slow Ventures, and Bling Capital. Although Mayer has admitted to investing her own capital in the startup, she emphasized that the round was led by Green, a venture capitalist with a storied record of identifying iconic consumer brands such as Warby Parker, Chime, and Dollar Shave Club.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green’s investment suggests Dazzle is poised for the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/vcs-discuss-why-most-consumer-ai-startups-still-lack-staying-power/\">coming wave</a> of new AI-infused consumer businesses. The founder of Forerunner Ventures previously told TechCrunch that while enterprise AI took the early lead in this tech cycle, consumer-facing AI is a “late bloomer” that’s finally ready for its breakout.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even for a founder of Mayer’s fame, landing Green as a lead investor is a significant stamp of credibility for Dazzle, especially after Sunshine was widely considered to be a flop. “I think she really has a great sense for where people and platforms are going,” Mayer said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mayer told TechCrunch that the Sunshine team began prototyping Dazzle last summer, a project that quickly eclipsed their previous work in ambition and opportunity. “We realized that this was something that we were much more excited about,” she said, noting that Dazzle has potential for “a much bigger impact” than what Sunshine was building.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Originally founded as Lumi Labs in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” Despite its founder’s high profile, the product struggled to gain traction.

But this will require users to adapt to a new way of doing things, as many are used to engaging with online services through the web or mobile apps. To be successful in getting consumers to change their behavior, using apps via AI will need to be seen as being as easy, if not easier, than the existing model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For that to work, the AI providers would need to at least match the breadth of online services provided by a traditional app store, which is already a more curated selection than what’s available via the web. Or, providers will need to get very good at suggesting apps to use at the right time, without seeming overly pushy, as users can <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/openai-slammed-for-app-suggestions-that-looked-like-ads/\">perceive unwelcome prompts as ads</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Digital avatar generation company <a href=\"https://lemonslice.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lemon Slice</a> is working to add a video layer to those chats with a new diffusion model that can create digital avatars from a single image.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Called Lemon Slice-2, the model can create a digital avatar that works on top of a knowledge base to play any role required of the AI agent, like addressing customer queries, helping with homework questions, or even working as a mental health support agent.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the early days of GenAI, my co-founders started to play around with different video models, and it became obvious to us that video was going to be interactive. The compelling part about tools like ChatGPT was that they were interactive, and we want video to have that layer,” co-founder Lina Colucci said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lemon Slice says this is a 20-billion-parameter model that can work on a single GPU to livestream videos at 20 frames per second. The company is making the model available through an API and an embeddable widget that companies can integrate into their sites with a single line of code. After an avatar is created, you can change the background, styling, and appearance of a character at any point.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides human-like avatars, the company is also focusing on being able to generate non-human characters to suit different needs. The startup is using ElevenLabs’ tech to generate the voices of these avatars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded by Lina Colucci, Sidney Primas, and Andrew Weitz in 2024, Lemon Slice is betting that using its own general-purpose diffusion model (a type of generative model that learns to work backwards from noisy training data to generate new data) for making avatars will set it apart from competitors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The existing avatar solutions I’ve seen to date add negative value to the product,” Colucci said. “They are creepy, and they are stiff. They look good for a few seconds, and as soon as you start interacting with them, it feels very uncanny, and it doesn’t put you at ease. The thing that has prevented avatars from really taking off is that they haven’t been good enough.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To fund that effort, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $10.5 million in seed funding from Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Dropbox CTO Arash Ferdowsi, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, and The Chainsmokers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lemon Slice 2 Demos\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VKqfONdPCo0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says it has guardrails in place to prevent unauthorized face or voice cloning, and that it uses large language models for content moderation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lemon Slice would not name the organizations using its technology, but said the model is being put to work for use cases like education, language learning, e-commerce, and corporate training.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup faces stiff competition from video generation startups like D-ID, HeyGen, and Synthesia, as well as other digital avatar makers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/avatar-startup-genies-launches-1m-fund-for-developers-building-ar-experiences/\">Genies</a>, Soul Machine, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/22/praktika-raises-35-5m-to-use-ai-avatars-to-make-learning-languages-feel-more-natural/\">Praktika</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/avataros-snags-7m-seed-round-from-m13-to-build-an-ai-powered-virtual-influencer-platform/\">AvatarOS</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ilya Sukhar, a partner at Matrix, thinks that avatars will be useful in areas where videos are prominent. For instance, people like learning from YouTube rather than reading long blocks of text. He noted that Lemon Slice’s technical prowess and its own will give it an edge over other startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a deeply technical team with a track record of shipping ML products, not just demos and research. Many of the other players are bespoke to particular scenarios or verticals, and Lemon Slice is taking the generalized <a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“bitter lesson”</a> scaling approach (of data and compute) that has worked in other AI modalities,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Y Combinator’s Jared Friedman believes that using a diffusion-style model allows Lemon Slice to generate any kind of avatars as compared to some other startups that are focused on either human-like or game character-like avatars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Lemon Slice is, I believe, the only company taking the fundamental ML approach that can eventually overcome the uncanny valley and break the avatar Turing test. They train the same type of model as Veo3 or Sora: a video diffusion transformer. Because it is a general-purpose model that does the whole thing end-to-end, it has no ceiling on how good it can get; the others top out below photorealistic. It also works for both human and non-human faces and requires only an image to add a new face,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently has eight employees, and plans to use the funds to hire engineering and go-to-market staff, along with paying the compute bills to train its models.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Cars running red lights, drivers not wearing their seatbelts, and unlicensed vehicles driving at night, to name a few.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The driver of one of the most surveilled vehicles in the system was tracked over six months as he traveled between the eastern city of Chirchiq, through the capital Tashkent, and in the nearby settlement of Eshonguzar, often multiple times a week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We know this because the country’s sprawling license plate-tracking surveillance system has been left exposed to the internet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Security researcher <a href=\"https://cypeace.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anurag Sen</a>, who discovered the security lapse, found the license plate surveillance system exposed online without a password, allowing anyone access to the data within. It’s not clear how long the surveillance system has been public, but artifacts from the system show that its database was set up in September 2024, and traffic monitoring began in mid-2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposure offers a rare glimpse into how such national license plate surveillance systems work, the data they collect, and how they can be used to track the whereabouts of any one of the millions of people across an entire country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lapse also reveals the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/lawmakers-say-stolen-police-logins-are-exposing-flock-surveillance-cameras-to-hackers/\">security and privacy risks</a> associated with the mass monitoring of vehicles and their owners, at a time when the United States is building up its nationwide array of license plate readers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/flock-safety-quietly-hired-a-sitting-california-mayor-now-hes-suing-flock/\">many of which are provided by surveillance giant Flock</a>. Earlier this week, independent news outlet 404 Media reported that Flock left dozens of its own license plate reading cameras publicly exposed to the web, allowing a reporter to <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/flock-exposed-its-ai-powered-cameras-to-the-internet-we-tracked-ourselves/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">watch themselves being tracked in real time</a> by a Flock camera. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sen said he found the exposed Uzbek license plate surveillance system earlier this month, and shared details of the security lapse with TechCrunch.

While there are plenty of Santa trackers, nothing similar existed for the tooth fairy.

When a child loses a tooth, parents can visit the website and enter their email to receive notifications as Kiki begins her mission. Throughout the evening, children receive a series of video updates showing Kiki preparing for her journey, departing from headquarters, and traveling to collect the tooth. These updates may include flight speed information, vlog-style check-ins, and cute selfies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The experience is hosted entirely on the site, with countdowns to each new video, making it feel like an exciting daylong event that builds anticipation for bedtime. Plus, Finel believes the evening updates help motivate children to brush their teeth and prepare for sleep. Then the final update takes place in the morning, when the child is congratulated and can check their special gift under their pillow.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?w=503\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076929\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=111,150 111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=222,300 222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=503,680 503w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=318,430 318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=532,720 532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=665,900 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=591,800 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=494,668 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=277,375 277w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=456,617 456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=393,531 393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/toothfairy_screenshot.jpeg?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kiki the Tooth Fairy/Oliver Finel</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in October, the website is gearing up to launch a redesign soon.

The company conceded that “agent mode” in ChatGPT Atlas “expands the security threat surface.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI launched its ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers rushed to publish their demos, showing it was possible to write a few words in Google Docs that were capable of changing the underlying browser’s behavior. That same day, Brave <a href=\"https://brave.com/blog/unseeable-prompt-injections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published a blog post</a> explaining that indirect prompt injection is a systematic challenge for AI-powered browsers, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Perplexity’s Comet</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI isn’t alone in recognizing that prompt-based injections aren’t going away. The <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/mistaking-ai-vulnerability-could-lead-to-large-scale-breaches\">U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned</a> that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications “may never be totally mitigated,” putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. The U.K. government agency advised cyber professionals to reduce the risk and impact of prompt injections, rather than think the attacks can be “stopped.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For OpenAI’s part, the company said: “We view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we’ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s answer to this Sisyphean task? A proactive, rapid-response cycle that the firm says is showing early promise in helping discover novel attack strategies internally before they are exploited “in the wild.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not entirely different from what rivals like Anthropic and Google have been saying: that to fight against the persistent risk of prompt-based attacks, defenses must be layered and continuously stress-tested. <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2025/12/architecting-security-for-agentic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google’s recent work</a>, for example, focuses on architectural and policy-level controls for agentic systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its “LLM-based automated attacker.” This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bot can test the attack in simulation before using it for real, and the simulator shows how the target AI would think and what actions it would take if it saw the attack. The bot can then study that response, tweak the attack, and try again and again. That insight into the target AI’s internal reasoning is something outsiders don’t have access to, so, in theory, OpenAI’s bot should be able to find flaws faster than a real-world attacker would. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a common tactic in AI safety testing: build an agent to find the edge cases and test against them rapidly in simulation. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our [reinforcement learning]-trained attacker can steer an agent into executing sophisticated, long-horizon harmful workflows that unfold over tens (or even hundreds) of steps,” wrote OpenAI. “We also observed novel attack strategies that did not appear in our human red teaming campaign or external reports.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png\" alt=\"a screenshot showing a prompt injection attack in an OpenAI browser.\" class=\"wp-image-3078403\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png 1194w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-prompt-injection-demo-2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a demo (pictured in part above), OpenAI showed how its automated attacker slipped a malicious email into a user’s inbox. When the AI agent later scanned the inbox, it followed the hidden instructions in the email and sent a resignation message instead of drafting an out-of-office reply. But following the security update, “agent mode” was able to successfully detect the prompt injection attempt and flag it to the user, according to the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says that while prompt injection is hard to secure against in a foolproof way, it’s leaning on large-scale testing and faster patch cycles to harden its systems before they show up in real-world attacks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An OpenAI spokesperson declined to share whether the update to Atlas’ security has resulted in a measurable reduction in successful injections, but says the firm has been working with third parties to harden Atlas against prompt injection since before launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rami McCarthy, principal security researcher at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/wiz-chief-technologist-ami-luttwak-on-how-ai-is-transforming-cyberattacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cybersecurity firm Wiz</a>, says that reinforcement learning is one way to continuously adapt to attacker behavior, but it’s only part of the picture. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A useful way to reason about risk in AI systems is autonomy multiplied by access,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Agentic browsers tend to sit in a challenging part of that space: moderate autonomy combined with very high access,” said McCarthy. “Many current recommendations reflect that trade-off. Limiting logged-in access primarily reduces exposure, while requiring review of confirmation requests constrains autonomy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those are two of OpenAI’s recommendations for users to reduce their own risk, and a spokesperson said Atlas is also trained to get user confirmation before sending messages or making payments. OpenAI also suggests that users give agents specific instructions, rather than providing them access to your inbox and telling them to “take whatever action is needed.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Wide latitude makes it easier for hidden or malicious content to influence the agent, even when safeguards are in place,” per OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI says protecting Atlas users against prompt injections is a top priority, McCarthy invites some skepticism as to the return on investment for risk-prone browsers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For most everyday use cases, agentic browsers don’t yet deliver enough value to justify their current risk profile,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. “The risk is high given their access to sensitive data like email and payment information, even though that access is also what makes them powerful. That balance will evolve, but today the trade-offs are still very real.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In total, these projects represent nearly 6 gigawatts of generating capacity for the Eastern seaboard, a hotspot of data center development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Department of the Interior justified the action by citing unclassified government reports — it didn’t say which agency had produced them, nor did it link to them — along with “recently completed classified reports” from the Pentagon. The department said it would give the government time to work with stakeholders to address national security concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The statement did not acknowledge the ongoing work government and wind developers have been doing to address national security concerns, specifically related to radar, for years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The report the Interior Department is likely referring to was <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/EXEC-2022-004484%20-%20Report%20to%20Congress%20as%20of%20December%2014%202023%20(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">issued by the Department of Energy in February 2024</a>, and it lists a number of projects that were then underway to mitigate the problem of radar interference.

Researchers have been studying the phenomenon for well over a decade, and they’ve developed a range of strategies to mitigate any problems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wind turbines present a unique challenge to radar operators. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The motion of a wind turbine gives it a complex Doppler signature,” Nicholas O’Donoughue, a senior engineer at the Rand Corporation, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Doppler refers to the change in frequency of a wave like a radar signal caused by a moving object. As a wind turbine’s blades sweep through their arc, they are alternately moving toward and away from the radar station. The angle and speed of the blades can have an effect, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those, along with other considerations, can “challenge the detection of any targets that are near the wind farm,” O’Donoughue said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But radar systems can filter out signals that result from wind farms. “The primary approach is to use adaptive processing algorithms, such as Space-Time Adaptive Processing, to learn the structure of a wind farm’s interference,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Over time, the reflections from a wind farm can be processed to look for patterns, which can then be matched and suppressed. This process is analogous to how modern adaptive noise cancellation headphones work, albeit more complicated.” Objects with a low radar cross section can still slip through, he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because of that, many wind farms are already built with radar installations in mind. “The most basic and widely employed mitigation method is wind farm siting, such as modifying the layout of a proposed wind farm to keep the wind turbines out of the line-of-sight of the radar,” the 2024 Energy department report said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The offer includes an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from a major backer, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to provide tens of billions in equity financing for the deal. It’s the latest move by Ellison’s son, David Ellison — the CEO of Paramount Skydance — to pry the potential acquisition loose from his competition, the streaming giant Netflix.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” a Paramount <a href=\"https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-amends-its-superior-30-share-all-cash-offer-warner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a> published Monday states. The proposed equity financing had previously been included in Paramount’s offer, but the elder Ellison’s “personal guarantee” is new, the press release states.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revamped offer comes a mere week after the WBD board rejected Paramount’s initial bid, favoring, instead, a previous deal with Netflix. That deal was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2025/NETFLIX-TO-ACQUIRE-WARNER-BROS--FOLLOWING-THE-SEPARATION-OF-DISCOVERY-GLOBAL-FOR-A-TOTAL-ENTERPRISE-VALUE-OF-82-7-BILLION-Equity-Value-of-72-0-Billion/default.aspx\">announced on December 5</a>, outlining how the streamer would purchase the movie studio via a cash and stock option valued at $27.75 per WBD share, and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three days after the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount launched a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hostile bid valued at $108.4 billion</a>, offering $30 per share.

At the time of the rejection, the board noted that the deal with Netflix was “a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Paramount’s amended offer has been designed to “address WBD’s stated concerns regarding Paramount’s superior offer,” Paramount said. In October, CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/wbd-rejected-three-paramount-offers-sources.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a>, prior to the Netflix deal, WBD had previously rejected three different takeover offers from Paramount.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD,” said Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, in Monday’s press release. “Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders. Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added: “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch reached out to Warner Bros.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX has dramatically upped its launch cadence in recent years, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is looking like a more serious player after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/blue-origin-sticks-first-new-glenn-rocket-landing-and-launches-nasa-spacecraft/\">the mostly successful inaugural missions</a> of the New Glenn heavy-lift rocket.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now 20 years old, ULA was created by combining the space launch businesses of defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed Martin. ULA was a main provider to both NASA and the Department of Defense until SpaceX came along and started winning contracts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of Bruno’s biggest projects during his time at ULA was overseeing the development of the joint venture’s next-generation rocket, Vulcan. That project had two main objectives: help ULA keep pace with SpaceX, and reduce the U.S. government’s reliance on Russian rockets to access space. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vulcan leveraged a number of parts from prior ULA rocket programs like Atlas and Delta in an attempt to keep costs down, though it bet on Blue Origin to provide the engines. The project suffered numerous delays before it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/united-launch-alliance-and-astrobotic-launches-countdown-capital-shutdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">finally lifted off for the first time in 2024</a> — one whole decade after development began. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During that same time frame, SpaceX became the world’s most dominant space launch provider, winning government contracts and taking on numerous private missions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ULA’s Vulcan rocket has found <a href=\"https://www.ulalaunch.com/about/news/2025/12/16/united-launch-alliance-enables-expansion-of-amazon-leo-constellation-through-fourth-successful-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">customers in Amazon</a> (for its Leo internet satellites) and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/united-launch-alliance-and-astrobotic-launches-countdown-capital-shutdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">space startup Astrobotic</a>.

You can then choose what style of photo you’d like to color — such as anime, 3D movie, manga, cartoon, or comic. The app will then transform your picture using AI into either an on-screen or printable page for kids to color.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of requiring a tedious sign-up process, the app will step you through customization options the first time you begin creating. Here, you’re prompted to choose your preferred app icon and check off the various categories your child likes. You also can choose if you want to let kids color the photo as a printable page or on-screen (great in a pinch when kids are bored, but you don’t want them sucked into a TV show or game).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078260\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg 4284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0326.jpg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can try one generative AI project to get a feel for the app. It then costs either $4.99 per week or $49.99 per year to continue to generate new pictures.
