In 2026 so far, federal immigration agents have killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/deaths-ice-2026-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">at least eight people</a>, including at least two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis — Renee Good and Alex Pretti. As immigration enforcement has grown more extreme — even <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2026/01/23/us/liam-conejo-ramos-ice-wwk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">detaining school children</a> seeking legal asylum — tech workers have called on their leaders to speak up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech industry has always been entwined in politics. Companies like Palantir, Clearview AI, Flock, and Paragon are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/\">contracted by</a> U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and assist in the agency’s crackdowns. But as President Trump took office last year, his industry connections have grown. Elon Musk ran a government agency for months, and prolific Silicon Valley investor David Sacks is leading an advisory board on technology for the president. The CEOs behind some of the largest companies in the country — like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Google’s Sundar Pichai — had prime seats at Trump’s inauguration and have remained allied with him. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know our industry leaders have leverage: in October, they persuaded Trump to call off a planned ICE surge in San Francisco,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tech-workers-call-for-ceos-to-speak-up-against-ice-after-the-killing-of-alex-pretti/\">ICEout.tech</a>, a group of tech industry workers opposing ICE, wrote in a statement on January 24, the day of ICU nurse <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy/868567/alex-pretti-minneapolis-childhood-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alex Pretti</a>’s death. “Big tech CEOs are in the White House tonight,” the statement added, referring to a screening of a documentary about Melania Trump where <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/27/apple-tim-cook-trump-alex-pretti/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cook</a>, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, and Zoom’s Eric Yuan were in attendance. “Now they need to go further, and join us in demanding ICE out of all of our cities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of tech’s biggest players have since spoken out, to mixed reception from their employees and the industry. Below, we are keeping an ongoing list of what tech leaders have had to say.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-reid-hoffman-co-founder-of-linkedin\">Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, published an <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/opinion/2026/01/29/reid-hoffman-silicon-valley-can-t-neutral-any-longer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">editorial</a> in the San Francisco Standard on January 29, calling on Silicon Valley to stop trying to be neutral in the wake of the Minnesota killings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We in Silicon Valley can’t bend the knee to Trump,” Hoffman wrote. “We can’t shrink away and just hope the crisis will fade. We know now that hope without action is not a strategy — it’s an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said he’s been encouraged to see more tech leaders speaking out, saying: “it’s a good start to something America needs much more of right now.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Whichever candidates you may have supported in the past — or even if (like many of my friends in Silicon Valley) you don’t usually do politics — you almost surely did not want <em>this</em>,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sam-altman-ceo-at-openai\">Sam Altman, CEO at OpenAI</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/sam-altman-once-called-trump-115006304.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">publicly opposed</a> Trump’s policies during his first term, but has changed his tune in the new administration as his company has struck deals to develop AI infrastructure for the U.S. government, including the gargantuan $500 billion <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">Stargate project</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the days following Pretti’s death, Altman addressed OpenAI staff in an internal Slack message, which was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/business/dealbook/altman-openai-minnesota.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported by</a> The New York Times.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right,” he said. “President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman added, “We didn’t become super woke when that was popular, we didn’t start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular, and we are not going to make a lot of performative statements now about safety or politics or anything else. But we are going to continue to try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best as we can.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dario-amodei-ceo-at-anthropic\">Dario Amodei, CEO at Anthropic</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an NBC interview, anchor Tom Llamas <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYSC2rU9-Fs&amp;t=2826s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asked Dario Amodei</a> about his views on defense in relation to current events. The anchor pointed out that Anthropic has a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, and that it has partnered with Palantir — which has supplied technology to ICE — on projects for that agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, Amodei reaffirmed that Anthropic does not have any contracts with ICE, despite its relationship with the Defense Department, and emphasized his concern about “the need to protect democracies against autocracies” like China and Russia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m a big believer in, carefully, with guardrails, arming democracies to defend against these countries,” Amodei said, adding that these values persist in the context of internal American politics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to be really careful about making sure democracies are worth defending. We need to defend our own democratic values at home,” he said. “I believe some of the things we’ve seen in the last few days concern me about that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also mentioned ICE’s raids in Minneapolis in a <a href=\"https://x.com/darioamodei/status/2015833051205414955?s=46&amp;t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on X, where he referred to “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tim-cook-ceo-at-apple\">Tim Cook, CEO at Apple</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s CEO addressed staff in an <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/2016341138719076362\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">internal memo</a> on January 27:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a time for deescalation,” Cook said. He later added, “I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-meredith-whittaker-president-of-signal\">Meredith Whittaker, president of Signal</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the tech industry workers behind ICEout.tech, Signal President Meredith Whittaker has been outspoken about the role tech leaders have in social justice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I want everyone in tech who’s ever intoned about freedom, or their love of privacy, or their commitment to liberty, to join me in an unequivocal condemnation,” Whittaker <a href=\"https://x.com/mer__edith/status/2016521608098140667\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> on X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another post, she said, “Masked agents of the US state are executing people in the streets and powerful leaders are openly lying to cover for them. To everyone in my industry who’s ever claimed to value freedom—draw on the courage of your convictions and stand up.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an end-to-end-encrypted messaging app, Signal is often used by activists to organize community actions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tony-stubblebine-ceo-at-medium\">Tony Stubblebine, CEO at Medium</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The leader of the online publishing platform Medium, Tony Stubblebine posted screenshots on Threads of a <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@the_coach_life/post/DUG2aMtERX5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">message</a> he shared with staff in which he explains his reasoning for allowing employees to take part in a <a href=\"https://nationalshutdown.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nationwide general strike</a> if they so choose, though he clarified that he is “not in the business of dictating people’s politics.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I started the week in my own head and heart over what I was seeing in Minneapolis and really struggling with the idea that those two murders were just the tip of the iceberg of wrongs,” Stubblebine wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the memo, he writes about the difficulty of navigating his role as a tech CEO during this time, saying that it feels “awkward to navigate being both on-mission and on-money.” He added that he is thinking about the company’s “responsibility to make [its] stance clear, especially as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign and supporting the current administration’s agenda.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stubblebine also pointed out that Medium’s approach to its role as a web publisher reflects the greater values of the company — “for example, that we don’t allow things like hateful content or racist slurs on Medium.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-jeff-dean-chief-scientist-at-google-deepmind\">Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jeff Dean has spoken out about his reaction to the killings in Minnesota.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is absolutely shameful,” Dean <a href=\"https://x.com/JeffDean/status/2015160545331306894\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> on X, responding to a video of federal agents shooting Alex Pretti. “Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera. Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-james-dyett-openai-s-head-of-global-business\">James Dyett, OpenAI’s head of global business</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">James Dyett posted on X about what he sees as hypocrisy in the tech industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,” Dyett <a href=\"https://x.com/dyett/status/2015193525273743447\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a>. “Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-keith-rabois-ethan-choi-and-vinod-khosla-partners-at-khosla-ventures\">Keith Rabois, Ethan Choi, and Vinod Khosla, partners at Khosla Ventures</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois has publicly expressed support for ICE and the Trump administration’s practices, others at the firm have publicly opposed these views.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rabois made incendiary comments on X after border patrol agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, prompting one founder to <a href=\"https://x.com/adam__xyz/status/2015301361974341657\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">respond</a> that that if he were a founder in Khosla Ventures’ portfolio, he would give the money back, calling Rabois “an embarrassment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ethan Choi, another partner at Khosla Ventures, <a href=\"https://x.com/EthanChoi7/status/2015524019085451353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">responded</a> to the post to clarify that not everyone at the firm agrees with Rabois’ views. “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at [Khosla Ventures], at least not mine,” Choi <a href=\"https://x.com/EthanChoi7/status/2015524019085451353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>, adding: “What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinod Khosla, the firm’s founder, reposted Choi’s message and called the federal agents “macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society,” Khosla <a href=\"https://x.com/vkhosla/status/2015647215642186008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>. “ICE personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way. There is politics but humanity should transcend that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khosla also posted on X that he agrees with Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, that more tech executives should speak out against the Trump administration.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The decline, though brief, benefited competing video apps like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/upscrolleds-founder-says-the-social-network-has-zoomed-past-2-5m-users/\">UpScrolled</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-alternative-skylight-soars-to-380k-users-after-tiktok-u-s-deal-finalized/\">Skylight Social</a>, which saw rapid user adoption as some looked for TikTok alternatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to estimates from digital market intelligence firm <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.similarweb.com\">Similarweb</a>, TikTok saw usage dip into the range of 86-88 million daily active users in the U.S. immediately after the ownership change. That compares with a typical average of 92 million daily active users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app has bounced back to more than 90 million daily active users, indicating that many who left TikTok have since returned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AsTikTok saw a small dip in usage, alternative video-sharing apps, UpScrolled and Skylight Social, began growing quickly. Although only a tiny fraction of TikTok’s size, UpScrolled topped 138,500 daily active users at its peak on January 28;  it has now dropped back down to 68,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Skylight Social hit 81,200 daily active users, according to Similarweb’s estimates and has since dropped to 56,300 daily active users. Overall, Skylight Social saw its user <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-alternative-skylight-soars-to-380k-users-after-tiktok-u-s-deal-finalized/\">sign-ups increase to 380,000</a> as of late January, the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3089093\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png 897w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=430,267 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=720,446 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=800,496 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=668,414 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=605,375 605w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=708,439 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/skylight-and-upscrolled.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Similarweb</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok’s usage decline, which prompted some to try the new apps, wasn’t driven by the ownership change directly, but rather by how users feared it would impact their TikTok experience. There were growing concerns about <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/\">TikTok’s updated privacy policy</a>, which gave the app permission to track users’ precise GPS location. (This addition could be related to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/tiktok-nearby-discover-whats-happening-around-you?lang=en-GB\">TikTok’s tests of a “Nearby” feed</a> to show users videos from local creators, but was added to the policy alongside the change in ownership, leading to user backlash over privacy concerns.)  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reading the privacy policy anew, some users also discovered disturbing language, like how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\">TikTok said it may collect users’ “immigration status</a>,” among other personal data. However, this turned out to be a reference that was included because of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which requires businesses to inform consumers if they collect certain sensitive data. TikTok does that — in the sense that anything someone shares on the platform in their video content technically becomes part of the platform, so it requires disclosure. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, TikTok experienced an unfortunately timed, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/\">multi-day data center outage</a>, which caused the app to not function properly, sometimes breaking search, likes, and comments, causing video glitches, disrupting the algorithm, and creating issues with the in-app chat. Users believed these glitches meant TikTok was now censoring their content, which sent them looking for alternatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2018090603582554366\">announced</a> on Sunday evening that the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/tiktok-says-its-services-are-restored-after-the-outage/\">data center outage was resolved</a>, chalking it up to a winter-storm-driven power outage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As users made peace with the new terms and conditions and the outage-driven issues were resolved, users returned to the platform, Similarweb’s data shows. But there’s still hope for the newcomers, as the firm notes that TikTok’s usage has been slowly declining over the latter part of 2025, when usage peaked at 100 million daily active users from July to October 2025, compared with the 90+ million seen now.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving.

These follow other leadership exits over the past year as it pushes ahead with plans to deepen its focus on AI investing and expand its footprint in the U.S., while keeping India as its largest market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest departures stem from an internal disagreement with senior partner Ashish Agrawal (pictured above, left) that led to a mutual decision to part ways, Managing Director Shailendra Singh told TechCrunch. He added that two other partners, Ishaan Mittal (pictured above, right) and Tejeshwi Sharma (pictured above, center), chose to leave alongside him.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh said Peak XV did not want to go into the specifics of the disagreement and was focused on moving forward. “Just out of privacy, and out of, like, trying to be classy about it,” he said. Singh added that such departures were not uncommon at large, multi-stage venture firms and that Peak XV wanted to move on quickly after several years of working together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All board seats held by the departing partners would be transitioned “imminently,” Singh said, noting that the firm already had overlapping representation across several portfolio companies. He said Peak XV was not concerned about continuity, noting that multiple general partners and operating partners were already involved across many of those boards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The departures mark the exit of long-tenured investors from the firm. Agrawal had been with Peak XV for more than 13 years, while Ishaan Mittal spent over nine years at the firm and Tejeshwi Sharma more than seven years, per their LinkedIn profiles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agrawal <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424404165432377344/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in a LinkedIn post that he had decided to “take the entrepreneurial plunge” and was teaming up with Mittal and Sharma to start a new venture capital firm. He described the move as an opportunity to build a new institution with longtime partners and thanked Peak XV’s leadership for what he called a “truly wonderful partnership.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his time at Peak XV, Agrawal led investments across fintech, consumer, and software, including Groww, one of the firm’s most prominent IPO exits in 2025. He also backed multiple early- and growth-stage companies alongside Mittal and Sharma, contributing to Peak XV’s broader portfolio build-out over the past decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agrawal, Mittal, and Sharma did not respond to messages for comments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV has also moved to strengthen its senior leadership from within. The firm on Tuesday promoted Abhishek Mohan to general partner, expanding its investment leadership bench, while Saipriya Sarangan was elevated to chief operating officer, taking charge of firm-wide operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The leadership changes come amid a standout year for Peak XV’s portfolio exits. Five of its companies — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/groww-raises-nearly-750m-in-ipo-as-indias-retail-investing-boom-continues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Groww</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/pine-labs-gets-warm-market-welcome-on-440m-india-ipo-despite-a-valuation-trim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pine Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/meeshos-606m-ipo-pops-as-enthusiasm-for-indias-e-commerce-startups-rises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meesho</a>, <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/wakefit-innovations-shares-list-flat-at-ipo-price-of-rs-195-on-nse-bse/articleshow/125970319.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wakefit</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/capillary-technologies-shares-debut-at-3-discount-to-ipo-price-on-bse-miss-grey-market-estimates-13689199.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Capillary Technologies</a> — went public in November and December 2025, generating roughly ₹300 billion (around $3.33 billion) in unrealized, mark-to-market gains for the firm, in addition to about ₹28 billion (about $310.61 million) in realized gains from share sales during the IPOs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to the latest departures, Peak XV has seen a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/two-senior-partners-are-leaving-peak-xv-amid-strategy-shift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">broader churn in its senior ranks</a> over the past 12 months. Last year, long-time investment leaders Harshjit Sethi and Shailesh Lakhani exited the India team, while Abheek Anand and Pieter Kemps departed from the firm’s Southeast Asia operations. The firm has also seen leadership changes across its marketing, policy, and operations teams in recent months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh dismissed a view circulating in the market that many of the partners who drove Peak XV’s largest exits were no longer at the firm, calling the narrative “not statistically true.” He said several of the firm’s most significant outcomes had been led by long-tenured partners who remained at Peak XV, and argued that the firm’s exit track record did not hinge on any single individual.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV currently has seven general partners, along with multiple partners and principals, according to Singh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The VC firm, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/sequoia-rebrands-china-india-and-southeast-asia-units/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">split from Sequoia Capital in 2023</a> and currently manages over $10 billion in capital across 16 funds, has made about 80 investments linked to AI, Singh said, highlighting its push to deepen its focus on AI funding. It is also preparing to open a U.S. office within the next 90 days as it expands its global footprint, per Singh, while continuing to view India as its largest and most important market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Singh stated the firm believed AI would reshape venture investing more profoundly than previous technology shifts, arguing that successful AI investing required investors with deep technical understanding rather than “generalist” experience. He added that Peak XV was looking to add more AI-native talent, including researchers and engineers with backgrounds in machine learning and large-scale model development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm has invested in more than 400 companies, and its portfolio has seen over 35 initial public offerings and several M&amp;As to date.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The judges repeatedly asked the company how users can meaningfully consent to data-sharing practices in a market where the app is pretty much the default communications platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With more than 500 million users, India is WhatsApp’s largest market and a key growth area for Meta’s advertising business. Judges in the case question the potential commercial value of metadata generated by the platform, and how such data could be monetized across Meta’s wider advertising and AI functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the hearing, Chief Justice Surya Kant said the Supreme Court would not allow Meta and WhatsApp to share even “a single piece of information” while the appeal was pending, arguing that users faced little real choice in accepting WhatsApp’s privacy policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling the messaging service a monopoly in practice, Kant questioned how “a poor woman selling fruits on the street” or a domestic worker could be expected to grasp how their data was being used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other judges also pressed Meta on how user data was analyzed beyond message content. Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the court wanted to examine the commercial value of behavioral data and how it was used for targeted advertising, arguing that even anonymized or siloed information carried economic worth. Government lawyers added that personal data was not only collected but also commercially exploited.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s lawyers said the platform’s messages are end-to-end encrypted and inaccessible even to the company, arguing that the privacy policy in question did not weaken user protections or allow chat content to be used for advertising.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case stems from a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2021 update</a> to WhatsApp’s privacy policy that required users in India to accept broader data-sharing terms with Meta or stop using the service. India’s competition regulator later imposed a ₹2.13 billion (around $23.6 million) penalty, finding that the policy abused WhatsApp’s dominant position in the messaging market. That ruling was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/22/whatsapp-wins-reprieve-in-india-over-user-data-sharing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">upheld</a> on appeal before Meta and WhatsApp moved the Supreme Court to challenge it. Meta’s lawyers told the court the penalty had already been paid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Supreme Court has adjourned the matter until February 9, allowing Meta and WhatsApp to explain their data practices in greater detail. At the suggestion of the competition regulator, the court also agreed to add the IT ministry as a party to the case, widening the scope of the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta declined to comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp has been facing heightened scrutiny over its  data privacy across the world. Authorities in the U.S. have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/us-has-investigated-claims-that-whatsapp-chats-aren-t-private\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">examined claims</a> that WhatsApp chats may not be as private as the company asserts, adding to broader questions about how encrypted messaging platforms handle user data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In India, WhatsApp is also navigating new regulatory constraints, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/14/whatsapps-biggest-market-is-becoming-its-toughest-test/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent SIM-binding rules</a> aimed at curbing fraud, which could limit how widely small businesses use the messaging service.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Vema then draws the hydrogen to the surface and sells it to industrial users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To supply the Quebec local market, which is about 100,000 tons per year, you would need 3 square kilometers, which is nothing,” Pierre Levin, CEO of Vema, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vema’s first pilot well will produce several tons of hydrogen per day, and next year, it plans to drill its first commercial well, which will reach 800 meters into the Earth. Vema expects to produce hydrogen from the first wells for less than $1 per kilogram, a widely used benchmark for clean hydrogen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most hydrogen today is made by a process known as steam reformation of methane (SMR), in which steam is used to break hydrogen molecules off methane from natural gas. It’s energy intensive, and both the process to make steam and the chemical reaction itself release carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Less polluting sources of hydrogen exist, but they tend to cost more.

Avalanche co-founder and CEO Robin Langtry thinks smaller is better. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the last several years, Langtry and his colleagues at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.avalanchefusion.com/\">Avalanche</a> have been working on what’s essentially a desktop version of nuclear fusion. “We’re using the small size to learn quickly and iterate quickly,” Langtry told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion power promises to supply the world with large amounts of clean heat and electricity, if researchers and engineers can solve some vexing challenges. At its core, fusion power seeks to harness the power of the Sun. To do that, fusion startups must figure out how to heat and compress plasma for long enough that atoms inside the mix fuse, releasing energy in the process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion is a famously unforgiving industry. The physics is challenging, the materials science is cutting edge, and the power requirements can be gargantuan. Parts need to be machined with precision, and the scale is usually so large as to obviate rapid fire experimentation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) are using large magnets to contain the plasma in a doughnut-like tokamak, others are compressing fuel pellets by shooting them with powerful lasers. Avalanche, though, uses electric current at extremely high voltages to draw plasma particles into an orbit around an electrode. (It also uses some magnets to keep things orderly, though they’re not nearly as powerful as a tokamak’s.) As the orbit tightens and the plasmas speed up, the particles begin to smash into each other and fuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The approach has won over some investors. Avalanche recently added another $29 million in an investment round led by R.A. Capital Management with participation from 8090 Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Founders Fund, Lowercarbon Capital, Overlay Capital, and Toyota Ventures. To date, the company has raised $80 million from investors, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">relatively small amount in the fusion world</a>. Other companies have raised several hundred to a few billion dollars. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-space-based-inspiration\">Space-based inspiration</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Langtry’s time at the Jeff Bezos-backed space tech company Blue Origin influenced how Avalanche is tackling the problem. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve figured out that using this sort of SpaceX ‘new space’ approach is that you can iterate really quickly, you can learn really quickly, and you can solve some of these challenges.” said Langtry, who worked with co-founder Brian Riordan at Blue Origin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going smaller allowed Avalanche to speed up. The company has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/avalanche-energy-hits-key-milestone-on-the-road-to-a-desktop-fusion-reactor/\">testing changes</a> to its devices “sometimes twice a week,” something that would be challenging and costly with a large device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Avalanche’s reactor is only nine centimeters in diameter, though Langtry said a new version grow to 25 centimeters and is expected to produce about 1 megawatt. That, he said, “is going to give us a significant bump in confinement time, and that’s how we’re actually going to get plasmas that have a chance of being Q&gt;1.” (In fusion, Q refers to the ratio of power in to power out. When it’s greater than one, the fusion device is said to be past the breakeven point.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those experiments will be carried out at Avalanche’s FusionWERX, a commercial testing facility the company also rents out to competitors. By 2027, the site will be licensed to handle tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that’s used as fuel and is crucial to many fusion startup’s plans for producing power for the grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Langtry wouldn’t commit to a date when he hopes Avalanche will be able to generate more power than its fusion devices consume, a key milestone in the industry. But he’s thinks the company is on a similar timeline as competitors like CFS and the Sam Altman-backed Helion. “I think there’s going to be a lot of really exciting things happening in fusion in 2027 to 2029,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company was founded in 2022, and offers participating firms the opportunity to earn ongoing revenue streams via partner affiliate sales, Axios <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2024/11/19/rewards-startup-kalder-seed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Güven was featured in last year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 list. The magazine <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/gokce-guven/?list=30under30-marketing-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">notes in the writeup that </a>Güven’s clients included major chocolatier Godiva and the International Air Transport Association, the trade organization that represents a majority of the world’s airlines.

Other brands “had no agreement with Kalder whatsoever—not even for free services,” officials said in a press release announcing the indictment. The pitch deck also “falsely reported that Kalder’s recurring revenue had steadily grown month over month since February 2023 and that by March 2024, Kalder had reached $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government also accuses Güven of having kept two separate sets of financial books. One of those sets included “false and inflated numbers,” and was presented to investors or potential investors to hide the “true financial condition of the company,” the government claims. The DOJ also alleges that Güven used lies about Kalder as well as forged documents to obtain a category of visa reserved for individuals of “extraordinary ability,” that would allow her to live and work in the United States. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch reached out to Güven through her personal website.

Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round also included significant investments from Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Capital, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Additional investors included BDT &amp; MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said the funds will be used to fuel its growth, which has accelerated over the past year and doesn’t appear to be slowing. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-sfo-airport-robotaxis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recently secured rides</a> to and from San Francisco International Airport and has expanded its robotaxi service throughout Northern California and several major metropolitan areas in the U.S., including Los Angeles, Austin, and Miami.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, the former Google self-driving project slowly progressed forward, testing its autonomous vehicle tech on public roads in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area and providing the occasional public or media demo. In 2016, it made its first geographic leap forward and began testing in Phoenix, where it eventually pulled its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/18/waymo-is-expanding-its-driverless-program-in-phoenix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">human safety driver</a> out of the vehicles. Phoenix became Waymo’s first robotaxi market, in which the public could hail driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo pushed down the accelerator in August 2023 after receiving the final necessary permit to operate a robotaxi service — and charge for rides — in California. It launched a limited service in San Francisco, later expanding to much of the greater Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and more recently to the freeways that connect the dozens of towns in the area. It also expanded to Los Angeles. The company launched in Austin and Atlanta in 2025 through a partnership with Uber. It kicked off the year by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/waymo-continues-robotaxi-ramp-up-with-miami-service-now-open-to-public/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expanding to Miami</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The geographic expansion has translated to 400,000 rides provided every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas. The company said that in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides, surpassing 20 million lifetime rides to date.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are no longer proving a concept,” the company wrote in its blog post. “We are scaling a commercial reality, laying the groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including Tokyo and London.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rapid expansion has also led to increased scrutiny and criticism as Waymo’s robotaxis have made missteps and the technology <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/we-talked-to-the-guy-who-was-stuck-in-a-waymo-robotaxi-on-an-dizzying-loop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creates problems</a> for some residents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some robotaxis have exhibited dangerous behaviors particularly in school zones.

Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” he wrote. (xAI has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/memphis-xai-colossus-elon-musk-chamber-messaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">imposing some of that hardship</a> on the communities near its data centers in Memphis, Tennessee.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up values the combined company at $1.25 trillion, according to Bloomberg News, which was first to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report the completed deal</a>.

It’s unclear whether the merger will affect that timeline. Musk did not address the IPO in his public memo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The merger brings together two of Musk’s companies, each with its own financial challenges. xAI is currently burning around $1 billion per month, according to Bloomberg. SpaceX, meanwhile, generates as much as 80% of its revenue from launching its own Starlink satellites, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/spacex-generated-about-8-billion-profit-last-year-ahead-ipo-sources-say-2026-01-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Reuters</a>.

(That revenue loop likely looks even more attractive when you consider that satellites are required to be de-orbited every five years by the Federal Communications Commission.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While space data centers may be the stated goal, SpaceX and xAI have very different near-term objectives. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX is currently trying to prove that its Starship rocket is capable of bringing astronauts to the moon and Mars, while xAI is competing with leading artificial intelligence companies like Google and OpenAI.

The new rules, which go in effect January 1, 2027, will prohibit the hidden, electronically actuated door handles popularized by Tesla — and now found on numerous other electric vehicles in China.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new rule dictates that each door (excluding the tailgate) should be equipped with a mechanically released external door handle. Vehicles must also have a mechanical release on the interior of the vehicle. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/china-bans-hidden-car-door-handles-in-world-first-safety-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported</a> on the new safety policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Numerous high-profile fatal incidents, in which occupants have become trapped in their vehicles, have raised concerns among safety regulators and advocates globally. China is the first country to issue a ban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investigation by Bloomberg</a> last September uncovered problems with the concealed door handles on Tesla vehicles, citing several crashes in which first responders or occupants were unable to open the doors because the electronic door locks weren’t getting enough power from the vehicle’s battery system to work properly. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration then opened a <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE25010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">defect investigation</a> into certain Tesla Model Y and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-24/tesla-faces-new-nhtsa-probe-over-model-3-emergency-door-handles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Model 3</a> door handles. While Tesla does have manual releases inside its vehicles, federal investigators noted that the releases can be hard for children to access, and many owners are unaware of their existence. Some U.S. lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/us-lawmaker-readies-bill-requiring-manual-door-handles-in-cars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">proposed regulation</a> requiring manual door releases in all new vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fatal incidents in China, including a crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 electric sedan, prompted regulators there to propose changes to EV door handles last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Chinese government began the process in May 2025 with more than 40 domestic vehicle manufacturers, parts suppliers, and testing institutions participating in the initial research. More than 100 industry experts held multiple rounds of discussions to determine the standard framework and form a draft standard of what would become the <a href=\"https://std.samr.gov.cn/gb/search/gbDetailed?id=4984F354F9F8CAD1E06397BE0A0AA46C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Safety Technical Requirements for Automobile Door Handles</a> rule, according to the Chinese government’s standards agency.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That included dozens of automakers, including Chinese companies such as BYD, Geely Holdings, SAIC, and Xiaomi, as well as foreign automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Hyundai, Nissan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Tesla, however, was not listed as an official “drafter,” according to information posted on the standards agency’s website.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, Adobe issued an <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/release-notes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">update</a> to the company’s support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing Adobe Animate will be discontinued on March 1, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise customers can continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition. Other customers will have support through March of next year, the company said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision has been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1qu41ca/adobe_is_planning_to_discontinue_animate_next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">met</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=adobe%20animate&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with</a> incredulity, disappointment, and anger among Adobe Animate users, who are concerned about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One customer, <a href=\"https://x.com/TylerGlaiel/status/2018394595340771653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posting on X</a>, pleaded with Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things <a href=\"https://x.com/ThisIsWronchi/status/2018404802510630914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like</a> “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” <a href=\"https://x.com/Ari4472/status/2018406974589722819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and</a> “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/animate/kb/end-of-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FAQ</a>, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reading between the lines, it sounds as if Adobe is saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s surprising is that Adobe can’t even recommend software that will fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it says customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, it suggests that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction after Animate was ignored at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software will continue to work for those who have it downloaded, Adobe noted. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some users are recommending other animation programs to use instead, including <a href=\"https://moho.lostmarble.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Moho Animation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.toonboom.com/products/harmony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Toon Boom Harmony.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Adobe for comment.

Scott said what makes their accelerator different is that it is specifically built “for student founders by student founders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Student programs like this aren’t new. UC Berkeley offers a similar program called Free Ventures for students seeking pre-seed funding, and MIT has its own Sandbox Innovation Fund. Even Stanford has some accelerator programs, both run by or affiliated with the school, such as StartX, LaunchPad, and Cardinal Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Students have enjoyed how we’ve brought together so many others from different American colleges,” Nafi said of his program, comparing it to Stanford’s Treehacks hackathon. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Breakthrough’s purpose is to fill in the funding and opportunity gap that exists in many of these ecosystems because students have historically lacked access to capital and the networks required to launch their entrepreneurial pursuits,” Scott added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Breakthrough will have a hybrid model, with in-person meetups at local powerhouse VC firms, culminating in a Demo Day at Stanford. Those participating in the program get access to grant funding (up to $10,000), compute credits (through Microsoft and the Nvidia Inception program), legal support, mentorship, “along with the opportunity to receive a $50,000 follow-on investment at the conclusion of the program,” Nafi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve nailed the student-founder experience to a T,” Nafi said. “Hence why we offer the resources we do and have structured the program in this way. Students really feel like we get them, and that’s because we are students.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The duo hopes to deploy the fund over three years, aiming to incubate at least 100 companies. Overall, Nafi hopes this fund will help grow Breakthrough into “the hub for Gen Z entrepreneurship and thought leadership,” specifically given the anxiety many young people feel about their economic future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Applications for the latest cohort open today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We hope that by supporting young entrepreneurs, we’re able to uplift as many stories as possible to then inspire many more across the world to use the tools and knowledge around them to pursue entrepreneurship not only to change their communities, but also gain economic stability for themselves and their families,” Nafi said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to correct the name of one of the investment firms. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Snowflake employees have access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise as well. The two companies are also partnering to build new AI agents and other AI products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By bringing OpenAI models to enterprise data, Snowflake enables organizations to build and deploy AI on top of their most valuable asset using the secure, governed platform they already trust,” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a press release. “Customers can now harness all their enterprise knowledge in Snowflake together with the world-class intelligence of OpenAI models, enabling them to build AI agents that are powerful, responsible, and trustworthy. Together, we’re setting a new standard for AI innovation, helping businesses transform with confidence, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI declined to share information on the deal beyond the press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If this deal feels familiar, it should. Snowflake announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/anthropic-signs-200m-deal-to-bring-its-llms-to-snowflakes-customers/\">$200 million enterprise deal with AI research lab Anthropic</a> at the beginning of December. At the time, Ramaswamy was quoted making very similar comments about how the partnership with Anthropic would give its customers access to powerful AI models on top of their existing data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our partnership with OpenAI is a multi-year commercial commitment focused on reliability, performance, and real customer usage. At the same time, we remain intentionally model-agnostic. Enterprises need choice, and we do not believe in locking customers into a single provider,” Baris Gultekin, vice president of AI at Snowflake, told TechCrunch over email. “OpenAI is an important partner, and it is one of several frontier model providers available on Snowflake today, alongside Anthropic, Google, Meta, and others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snowflake isn’t the only enterprise signing sizable deals with multiple AI companies.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, workflow automation platform ServiceNow <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/servicenow-inks-another-ai-partnership-this-time-with-anthropic/\">announced multi-year deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic</a> for very similar reasons as Snowflake. ServiceNow president, COO, and CPO Amit Zavery told TechCrunch at the time that working with both AI labs was deliberate because they wanted to give their customers and employees the ability to choose which model they wanted based on the task at hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to pinpoint which AI companies are seeing the most enterprise adoption success thus far. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Menlo Ventures survey</a> from late 2025 shows its portfolio company Anthropic holds a commanding market lead; an <a href=\"https://a16z.com/leaders-gainers-and-unexpected-winners-in-the-enterprise-ai-arms-race/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Andreessen Horowitz report</a> from last week naturally found its portfolio company OpenAI is leading the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These conflicting surveys make it difficult to accurately track enterprise AI usage trends. However, this latest string of deals does provide a short-term view of what enterprise AI adoption will look like. The upshot: Enterprises will continue to strike partnerships with multiple AI companies because each one offers large language models with varying strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprises are likely going to partner with multiple AI players because different AI companies and their large language models come with their own strengths and weaknesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise AI could easily become a market that contains several winners with an overlapping customer base, similar to how many ride-hail users swap between Lyft and Uber based on what makes the most sense for that moment. Case in point: Employees of these enterprises already use their preferred model regardless of their company contracts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> Or maybe there will be a clear winner after all. But for now, it’s likely we are going to see enterprises ink deals with multiple players as they continue to hunt for where AI can deliver tangible value.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, Mozilla <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-controls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> that Firefox will soon let users block all current and future generative AI features. Users will also have the option to block certain AI features in Firefox, while keeping others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starting with Firefox 148, which is rolling out on February 24, users will find a new AI controls section within the desktop browser settings. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People who don’t want access to any AI features from Firefox can turn on the “Block AI enhancements” toggle. When this setting is turned on, they won’t see pop-ups or reminders to use existing or upcoming AI features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new AI controls will also let users manage AI features individually. These features include “Translations,” which allows you to browse the web in your preferred language, Alt text in PDFs, AI-enhanced tab grouping, link previews, and Firefox’s AI chatbot in the sidebar, which lets you use your chosen chatbot as you browse, including services like Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is changing the web, and people want very different things from it,” the company wrote in a blog post. “We’ve heard from many who want nothing to do with AI. We’ve also heard from others who want AI tools that are genuinely useful. Listening to our community, alongside our ongoing commitment to offer choice, led us to build AI controls.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement comes as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/mozillas-new-ceo-says-ai-is-coming-to-firefox-but-will-remain-a-choice/\">Mozilla appointed Anthony Enzor-DeMeo</a> as its CEO back in December. Enzor-DeMeo said at the time that Mozilla would be investing in AI and would add AI features to Firefox, but that the company would make these features optional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it,” he wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enzor-DeMeo’s comments come as Mozilla scrambles to adapt in a rapidly changing browser market. Although browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome dominated the browser space for more than a decade, they are facing renewed competition from companies such as Perplexity, Arc, OpenAI, and Opera.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Mozilla plans to invest in new AI features, it’s also focused on transparency. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/mozilla-building-an-ai-rebel-alliance-to-take-on-openai-anthropic-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC reported</a> last week that Mozilla President Mark Surman said he’s building “a rebel alliance of sorts” made up of tech startups, developers, and public-interest technologists committed to making AI more trustworthy and to checking the power of players like OpenAI and Anthropic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mozilla will deploy around $1.4 billion worth of reserves to support tech businesses and nonprofits, including its own, CNBC reports.

This initiative could deliver significant cost savings for customers and may increase Grubhub’s appeal in a fiercely competitive market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Super Bowl advertisement stars actor George Clooney at an extravagant dinner party. As the host dramatically asks, “Who will eat the fees?” Clooney responds, “Grubhub will eat the fees.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyvGh2-Gsdg?si=7VG2PpbF_ErYbURE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Grubhub says this is a permanent offering aimed at putting more money back in customers’ pockets amid challenging economic times. The company notes that delivery and service fees on orders over $50 usually average about $13 per transaction across food delivery apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Grubhub’s move to permanently eliminate fees on all orders over $50 stands out as a unique offer in the food delivery space. Neither DoorDash nor Uber Eats offers a permanent waiver of delivery and service fees on large orders. Their promotions are typically limited-time offers or tied to paid subscription services (such as DashPass or Uber One), which often apply only to select restaurants or are subject to other restrictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, this new offering comes as Grubhub faces challenges in user growth and trails behind its competitors. The delivery company, which was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/just-eat-takeaway-sells-grubhub-to-wonder-for-650-million/\">acquired</a> by Marc Lore’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/food-delivery-startup-wonder-acquires-media-company-tastemade-for-90m/\">Wonder Group</a> in 2024, saw its monthly active users decline by 20% year-over-year in 2025, to 8 million, <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/creativity/grubhub-enlists-george-clooney-to-announce-its-new-disruptive-fee-structure-in-super-bowl-ad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to</a> marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. <a href=\"https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2025/DoorDash-Releases-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DoorDash</a> boasts nearly 50 million monthly active users.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​In addition to its new fee policy, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/grubhub-parent-acquires-restaurant-rewards-startup-claim/\">Grubhub recently acquired Claim</a>, a startup providing cash-back rewards at local restaurants, which customers can redeem for dine-in or pickup orders.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI is already having a seismic impact on how software is written, with much of the grunt work of programming now performed by swarms of agents and subagents. But as developers experiment with new interfaces and form factors for human-AI collaboration, it’s become hard for even the most advanced AI labs to keep up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The current trend is for agentic software development — systems where AI agents can work independently on coding tasks — epitomized by the Claude Code and Cowork apps. In the meantime, OpenAI has been gradually building out its Codex tool, which launched as <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/codex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a command line tool</a> last April and <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded to a web interface</a> one month later.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now OpenAI is taking a major step toward catching up. On Monday, the company launched a new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">macOS app</a> for Codex, integrating many of the agentic practices that have become popular in the past year. The new app is designed to work with multiple agents in parallel, integrating <a href=\"https://agentskills.io/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">agent skills</a> and other state-of-the-art workflows. The launch also comes less than two months after <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2-codex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the launch of GPT-5.2-Codex</a>, OpenAI’s most powerful coding model, which the company hopes will be enough to tempt over Claude Code users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you really want to do sophisticated work on something complex, 5.2 is the strongest model by far,” CEO Sam Altman told reporters on a press call. “However, it’s been harder to use, so taking that level of model capability and putting it in a more flexible interface, we think is going to matter quite a bit.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Altman’s confidence in GPT-5.2 is understandable, coding benchmarks tell a more complicated story. GPT-5.2 does hold <a href=\"https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the top spot on TerminalBench</a> (a test measuring how well AI handles command-line programming tasks), at least as of press time. But agents from Gemini 3 and Claude Opus have logged roughly equivalent scores — lower, but within the margin of error of the benchmark. Results from <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SWE-bench</a>, another coding benchmark that tests AI’s ability to fix real-world software bugs, are similar, showing no clear advantage for GPT-5.2. However, agentic use cases have been difficult to benchmark effectively, and state-of-the-art models can vary significantly in user experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Codex app also comes with a range of new features that OpenAI says will help it achieve parity or, in some cases, outpace the various Claude apps. The Codex app will allow for automations that can be set to run in the background on an automatic schedule, with results placed in a queue to be reviewed when the user returns. Users can also select different personalities for the agent — from pragmatic to empathetic — depending on their working style.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But for the company, the biggest selling point is the sheer speed of development that’s made possible by AI. “You can use this from a clean sheet of paper, brand new, to make a really quite sophisticated piece of software in a few hours,” Altman said. “As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Ho said this “would explain the highly selective targeting” seen during the campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rapid7, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">investigated the incident</a>, attributed the hacking to Lotus Blossom, a long-running espionage group known to work for China, and said the hacks targeted government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notepad++ is one of the longest-running open source projects, spanning more than two decades, and it counts at least tens of millions of downloads to date, including by employees at organizations around the world.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who <a href=\"https://doublepulsar.com/small-numbers-of-notepad-users-reporting-security-woes-371d7a3fd2d9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first discovered the cyberattack and wrote up his findings</a> in December, the hackers compromised a small number of organizations “with interests in East Asia” after someone unwittingly used a tainted version of the popular software. Beaumont said that the hackers were able to gain “hands-on” access to the computers of victims who were running hijacked versions of Notepad++. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ho said that the “exact technical mechanism” of how the hackers broke into his servers remains under investigation, but provided some details as to how the attack went down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the blog, Ho said that Notepad++’s website was hosted on a shared hosting server. The attackers “specifically targeted” Notepad++’s web domain with the goal of exploiting a bug in the software to redirect some users to a malicious server run by the hackers. This allowed the hackers to deliver malicious updates to certain users who had requested a software update, until the <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v889-released/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bug was fixed in November</a> and the hackers’ access was terminated in early December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented,” wrote Ho. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an email, Ho told TechCrunch that his hosting provider confirmed his shared server was compromised but that the provider did not say how the hackers initially broke in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ho apologized for the incident, and urged users to download the <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.9.1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most recent version</a> of his software, which contains a fix for the bug.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cyberattack targeting Notepad++ users is somewhat reminiscent of the 2019-2020 cyberattack affecting customers of SolarWinds, a software company that makes IT and network management tools for large Fortune 500 organizations, including government departments. Russian government spies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/\">hacked into the company’s servers</a> and secretly planted a backdoor in its software, allowing the Russian spies to access data on those customers’ networks once the update had rolled out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The SolarWinds breach affected several government agencies, including Homeland Security and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice, and State.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated with a response from Ho and with additional details from Rapid7.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They’ll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed.
