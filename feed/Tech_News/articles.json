She still has majority ownership in the company, but said she’s happy that fundraising and finances are off her plate.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She said she’s also happy she was able to pick her successor, finding Dickman through an executive recruiter. Many other ousted founders are not able to do so. She asked the recruiter to find someone who was a good person, who wouldn’t strip and sell the company for quick cash, and who would understand the technology.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Early-stage companies have all kinds of challenges across the board. In the end, it happened. It’s been resolved,” Dickman told TechCrunch. He compared him and Kelly to yin and yang, as he spent decades in the creator space and has worked at a few early-stage startups. She is analytical, he said, and very product-focused, while he likes having more of a leadership role.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I feel like we’re a good combo and complementary to drive this forward,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kelly, meanwhile, is already seeing some changes, as Dickman has been CEO for a few weeks already. She said his fundraising deck made it to the desk of a VC fund, and they forwarded it to someone else, nudging them to take a look at the product.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have not had that experience with fundraising, as you could probably imagine,” she said, referring to the experience that women, especially Black women, often face when raising venture money. “So that has been eye-opening.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under Dickman, she hopes for a bright future for the company. Curastory already has plans to expand into Canada, Australia and the UK soon.  <br> <br>The company is working on new features to target creators on other platforms like Spotify video, and to add AI to the product to make their advertising technology a bit more agentic, she said. It’s current video enablement tools include YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook Watch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also plans to add a more enhanced attribution model for advertisers that would eliminate the need for influencer promo codes.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Those are the immediate, near-term product, sales, globalization things,” Kelly said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite this shocking end to her run as the CEO of her company, she told TechCrunch, “being a founder and CEO is one of the most humbling and rewarding experiences I think anyone can have.” She hopes to share her lessons learned and experiences with others, “especially women and people of color.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Big tech companies and cloud providers have been <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-15/google-to-lift-india-data-hub-plan-above-15-billion-naidu-says\">investing billions of dollars</a> to expand local capacity and tap the country’s growing adoption of AI products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With HyperVault, TCS and TPG plan to develop liquid-cooled, high-density data centers with the power and network capacity required to support advanced AI workloads across major cloud regions, the companies said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liquid cooling and high-density rack designs are growing common as the GPUs needed to power AI inference and training use significantly more power and generate more heat than conventional CPU servers. But such designs also raise questions about resource use in countries like India, where water scarcity is already a concern. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In urban hubs such as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, where much of India’s data-center capacity is concentrated, existing water stress could complicate operations. S&amp;P Global, citing Uptime Institute estimates, <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/india-forward/shifting-horizons/will-data-center-growth-india-propel-country-global-hub-status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">noted</a> that a 1-MW data center load can require up to 25.5 million liters of water a year for cooling, adding pressure to already strained infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rapid building of AI data centers stands to further stress India’s power and land use, two other bottlenecks identified by industry analysts. High-density AI clusters require reliable electricity supply and large parcels of industrial land, two requirements increasingly difficult to secure in major urban regions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, global tech companies are treating India as their frontier for building AI infrastructure. Local and global technology firms have announced investments of more than $32 billion over the last two years to expand data center infrastructure in the country, according to S&amp;P Global.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, Microsoft said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/microsoft-to-pump-3-billion-into-cloud-and-ai-push-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invest $3 billion over two years</a> in India’s cloud and AI infrastructure, and in  October, Google said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spend $15 billion over five years</a> to build a gigawatt-scale AI data center hub in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. And back in 2023, Amazon committed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/aws-to-invest-12-7-billion-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$12.7 billion to build AWS cloud infrastructure</a> in India through 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TCS said it would work with hyperscalers and AI companies to design, deploy and operate AI infrastructure as the platform expands. The company plans to build around 1.2 gigawatts of capacity in its initial phase.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 95% of India’s new data-center capacity over the next five years will come from leased facilities, and the remainder will be driven by hyperscalers building dedicated AI infrastructure, S&amp;P Global estimates. Local players like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/reliance-plans-world-biggest-ai-data-centre-in-india-report-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reliance Industries</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/12/ctrls-investment-data-centers-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CtrlS</a> are also expanding their data-center capacity to meet rising demand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TCS and TPG project that India’s total data-center capacity could exceed 10 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 1.5 gigawatts today.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The automaker slowly started building those trucks again in October.

And compared to Nano Banana’s resolution cap of 1024 x 1024px, users can generate 2K or 4K images with Nano Banana Pro.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image. Comparatively, the new model costs $0.139 for each 1080p or 2K image, and $0.24 for every 4K image.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069477\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GEMIN-Woman-in-a-field.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new model can use six high-fidelity shots or blend up to 14 objects within an image.

The startup said that, after three months of usage, an average user writes more than 50% of their characters through the app. The company has also reached 270 of the Fortune 500 companies and has signed 125 companies as enterprise customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why, after just raising<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/wispr-flow-raises-30m-from-menlo-ventures-for-its-ai-powered-dictation-app/\"> a $30 million round led by Menlo Ventures in June</a>, the company has now raised an additional $25 million led by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.notablecap.com/\">Notable Capital</a> with participation from Steven Bartlett’s Flight Fund, TechCrunch has learned exclusively. With this influx of capital, the company has raised $81 million in total.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notable’s Hans Tung, who has backed companies like Affirm, Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, Anthropic, and TikTok, is joining Wispr’s board as an observer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wispr’s CEO Tanay Kothari said that, since June, Wispr Flow has grown 40% month-over-month. Plus, the product has been quite popular within the VC community. And because of that, the company started getting a lot of inbound investor interest. (Granola is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/vcs-love-using-the-ai-meeting-notepad-granola-so-they-gave-it-20m/\">another such example</a> of this trend).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were still not planning to raise anytime soon because we had a really long runway and the team’s really lean. But when I heard from Hans and Steven, it made sense to put something together to bring them on,” Kothari told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kothari added that when Notable’s team, including investor Chelcie Taylor, presented to him, they had done deep research, interviews with competitors, and had built a strong case about investing in Wispr.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069490\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg 2588w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=1200,686 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=1280,732 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=430,246 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=720,412 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=900,515 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=800,457 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=1536,878 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=2048,1171 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=668,382 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=656,375 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=1079,617 1079w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=708,405 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Wispr-Flow-users.jpeg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Wispr</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kothari said the company is now thinking about international growth and new product opportunities. With the additional funding, the startup would be able to hire top machine learning talent that might otherwise go to a company like OpenAI or Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CEO is pleased with user growth and said that the company is at 100x user base year-over-year with 70% retention over 12 months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, he recalled there was a time when the startup noticed a dip as more non-technical people discovered the app. Those people installed the app, tried out the dictation feature within the app, and then dropped off. The problem was that there was no clear guidance to indicate that they could use the dictation in other apps, too. To address this, the startup created a design flow for new users to guide them to use dictation in the apps they use the most.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Intro to Wispr Flow: voice-to-text AI that turns speech into clear, polished writing in every app.\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6XJIbRksgI?start=1&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wispr also wants the Flow app to be available on more surfaces apart from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/wispr-flow-releases-ios-app-in-a-bid-to-make-dictation-feel-effortless/\">Windows, Mac, and iOS</a>. The company is working on an Android app with a beta version slated to be out by year-end, followed by a stable version launch in Q1 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also wants to invest in building its own voice models to understand users better with personalized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It aims to reduce the number of edits the users have to make after they dictate through Flow. Currently, its error rate is around 10%, lower than 27% for OpenAI’s Whisper and 47% for Apple’s native transcription, it claims.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069491\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg 2240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=1200,771 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=1280,823 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=430,276 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=720,463 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=900,579 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=800,514 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=1536,987 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=668,429 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=583,375 583w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=960,617 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=708,455 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flow-pui2.jpeg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Wispr</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wispr is not thinking of expanding beyond consumer applications immediately, but it is testing its technology through a closed API with select enterprises and hardware partners and expects to open it up to more developers next year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Wispr has received more VC attention, there are other apps that are competing with it too in the dictation space, including YC-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/willows-voice-keyboard-lets-you-type-across-all-your-ios-apps-and-actually-edit-what-you-said/\">Willow</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://withaqua.com/\">Aqua</a>;  <a href=\"https://www.monologue.to/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Monologue</a>, which is part of <a href=\"https://every.to/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Every’s subscription bundle</a>; along with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.typeless.com\">Typeless</a> <a href=\"http://talktastic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Talktastic</a>, <a href=\"https://superwhisper.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Superwhisper</a>, and <a href=\"https://betterdictation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Betterdictation</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wispr wants to be more than a dictation tool by automating some of the tasks, like replying to emails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What I really like about Wispr is that they are trying to be more than a dictation app and become like a voice-led operating system that can initiate workflow automation.

The Alphabet-owned company is already offering rides on surface streets <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-giving-rides-on-freeways-in-these-3-cities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">and highways</a> in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix, and is live in Austin and Atlanta as well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2026, Waymo plans to expand to Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, D.C. It’s also testing in New York City, and plans to offer commercial rides internationally starting with London and Tokyo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new cities announced Thursday could present some unique challenges for Waymo, though. Minneapolis has perhaps the harshest winters of the cities Waymo has chosen to date. Snow could challenge Waymo’s perception stack, and the lack of traction will give its automated driving system some extra work to do. New Orleans, meanwhile, has a lot of tight, one-way streets that are heavily used by pedestrians — especially in the French Quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Waymo has expanded, it’s been working with partners in a number of cities to help operate its fleets.

Amazon-owned Zoox is offering free rides in its custom-built robotaxi in Las Vegas, and letting members of its early-rider program take trips in San Francisco while it awaits a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/zoox-to-begin-offering-robotaxi-rides-to-public-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">necessary exemption</a> from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to launch full commercial operations. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla, meanwhile, is trying to expand its nascent robotaxi service, which still has safety monitors in the driver’s seat.

It can be reused an infinite number of times, and it’s often cheaper to recycle than to produce new aluminum because it requires so much less energy.  Yet only about <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/aluminum-material-specific-data\">a third</a> of the aluminum used in the U.S. gets recycled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem lies in sorting mixed aluminum scrap — a challenge that has long stumped the recycling industry.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Michael Siemer, CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sorteratechnologies.com\">Sortera</a>, thinks his company has found the key, though. Sortera says it has developed a system that can separate aluminum grades with over 95% accuracy — a breakthrough that could unlock a massive untapped resource in the recycling industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s how it works: The company uses an AI model that identifies different grades of aluminum based on data from lasers, X-ray fluorescence, and high-speed cameras. The system has to classify each chip — about the size of a large potato chip — in a fraction of a second. “Ten milliseconds is a long time,” Siemer says. Once the vision system identifies the grade, a series of nozzles blow precise puffs of air to flip the chip off the belt and into the correct bin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That speed and accuracy matters because other recycling operations must melt the aluminum first before they can tell which type of alloy it is. And if alloys aren’t sorted properly, the mixed heap is worth far less because customers can’t be confident it will have the properties they need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People have been wanting to go after [this unsorted aluminum], and nobody’s been able to unlock it,” says Siemer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sortera’s sorting accuracy has further helped the company unlock something else many startups seek: profitability. “The margin is exponential above 90%, [while] 92% gets you a nice little margin, 95% gets you a big margin, [and] 98% is a really big margin.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s helped the company become cash flow positive since August, he says, all based on the operation of a single plant in Indiana. To build a second plant in Tennessee, Sortera recently raised $20 million in equity and $25 million in debt in a round led by VXI Capital and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price, with participation from Overlay Capital and Yamaha Motor Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Trinity Capital is providing additional equipment funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new plant, which is being built near Nashville, will come online in April or May. “It’s a replica of our Indiana plant,” Siemer says. At the Indiana facility, he says, “we run full-tilt, 24-7, and we’re running millions of pounds a month.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"End of Life and Clip Production Mobile Format '25\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBahvygzR0w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So where does all that aluminum come from? The scrap aluminum that Sortera receives tends to come from shredded automobiles. Each aluminum grade fractures differently when shredded, and those visual differences help the AI classify the metal. “The chemical differences manifest themselves in the shredding,” Siemer says. Different alloys produce distinctive tears and folds that give the system clues. “You gain these little insights so that in about a 10-millisecond time window, you go, ‘I’m pretty darn sure that’s 356 [grade aluminum],” Siemer says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Sortera expands, much of its aluminum will likely end up back on automotive assembly lines. Automotive manufacturers have been using increasing amounts of the metal to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency. “Every auto OEM on the planet has been to Indiana at least twice,” Siemer says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sortera is currently working on ways to process other metals like copper and titanium, but for the near future, the company remains focused on aluminum. “We could instantly sort the 18 billion tons of aluminum made annually in the U.S. Every piece of that, every pound would be sold at a profit in the U.S.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company raised at least $220 million, including $133 million in 2024, as it pursued a goal of making “driver optional” autonomous tractors that could perform tasks at places like wineries and other fruit farms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Monarch Tractor claims to have shipped around 500 of those tractors to date, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/monarch-tractor-lays-off-10-in-restructuring-towards-software-and-licensing-av-tech/\">announced a restructuring</a> in late 2024 that was supposed see its tractors expand to other use cases, like pushing feed at dairy farming and maintaining golf courses. CEO Praveen Penmesta also said at the time that Monarch Tractor would focus more on selling software services and licensing the company’s autonomous tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At least one customer — one of Monarch Tractors’ first dealers — claims the autonomous tech never worked well, if at all, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/monarch-tractor-sued-over-tractors-that-were-unable-to-operate-autonomously/\">according to a lawsuit</a> first reported by TechCrunch this week. Idaho dealership Burks Tractor claimed Monarch sold it “defective” vehicles that experienced “significant problems” after they arrived in 2024. Primarily, Burks accused Monarch’s tractors of being “unable to operate autonomously.” (Monarch denied the claims in a court filing.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Monarch Tractor suggests to employees in the memo on Thursday it is trying to pivot even harder away from making tractors — which may not be surprising, given that the startup lost its contract manufacturer, Foxconn, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/monarch-tractors-wont-be-built-by-foxconn-after-ohio-factory-sale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earlier this year</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The new business plan will enable Monarch customers to launch fully commercialized software as a service (SaaS) autonomy and other software offerings direct to consumers, unlocking new revenue streams to OEMs,” the startup’s human resources team wrote. “Unfortunately, the timing for completing the transition to the new business plan puts Monarch at risk of shut down.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Monarch told employees in the memo it may permanently lay off “up to 102 employees.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In 2025, over 70% of Monarch’s revenue came from licensing, and this segment is expected to grow further in 2026” Penmesta told TechCrunch in an email Wednesday. He did not share an overall revenue figure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Investors are showing interest in Monarch’s technology for next-generation smart off-highway equipment, leveraging its cost-efficient hardware and field experience. The WARN notice reflects this shift in our teams and resources toward revenue-generating segments,” he said of the official layoff notice to the state.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear how many people currently work for Monarch. The startup had around 300 employees in late 2024 when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/monarch-tractor-sued-over-tractors-that-were-unable-to-operate-autonomously/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">laid off more than 10% of the company</a> as part of the restructuring. The former employees familiar with the recent cuts could not say exactly how large those layoffs were. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through this year, Monarch Tractor has also lost some top talent, including the co-founder from Tesla, Mark Schwager. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We started Monarch with a daring vision: that farming could be electrified, automated, smart and made more profitable — all at once,” Schwager wrote in a LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7350920850289700865/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> in July, while explaining he would remain on the company’s board. “Monarch is in great position and in great hands for the next leg of its trajectory – making the timing right for this transition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with a response from Monarch Tractor’s CEO.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And based on the company’s results, there may be reason to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001045810/93b7b492-410f-4d8e-922e-2a1ee69fea29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter, 62% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company’s net income on a GAAP basis was $32 billion, 65% higher year-over-year. Both revenue and profit results beat Wall Street expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revenue picture shows a company booming thanks largely to its data center business. Revenue generated by Nvidia’s data center business was a record $51.2 billion, up 25% from the previous quarter and up 66% from a year ago. The remaining $5.8 billion in revenue came from Nvidia’s gaming business with $4.2 billion, followed by sales in professional visualization and automotive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress <a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/Q326/Q3FY26-CFO-Commentary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">noted in a statement </a>to shareholders its data center business has been fueled by an acceleration of computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. During the company’s Q3 call, Kress said in this past quarter, the company announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders enterprises and super computing centers, and includes multiple landmark build outs,” Kress said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blackwell Ultra, a GPU unveiled in March and available in several configurations, has been particularly strong and is now the leader within the company. Previous versions of the Blackwell architecture also saw continued strong demand, according to the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huang said sales of its Blackwell GPU chips “are off the charts.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Huang said in the company’s Q3 earnings statement. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kress did note that the company’s shipments of H20, a data center GPU designed for generative AI and high-performance computing, were 50 million, a disappointing result due to its inability to sell to China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,,” Kress noted on the earnings call. “While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the U.S. and China governments, and will continue to advocate for America’s ability to compete around the world.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Importantly, Nvidia is forecasting more growth with a projected revenue of $65 billion in the fourth quarter, helping push its share price up more than 4% in after-hours trading. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upshot, at least in Huang’s view: forget about the bubble, there is only growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Jensen said during the company’s earnings call. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

An “infamous mystery hacker” known as the <a href=\"https://ghostintheshell.fandom.com/wiki/Puppet_Master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Puppet Master</a> is wreaking havoc on the internet, breaking into the so-called cyber-brains of several humans <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/yj4fsbdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as well as</a> “every terminal on the network.” As it turns out, the Puppet Master is a creation of Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, the Puppet Master is what we would call today a government-backed hacker, or advanced persistent threat (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#advanced-persistent-threat-apt\">APT</a>). In this case, however, the “phantom” hacker goes rogue and is wanted for “stock manipulation, spying, political engineering, terrorism, and violation of cyber-brain privacy.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That is the basic premise of the Japanese anime cult classic “<a href=\"https://ghostintheshell.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ghost in the Shell</a>,” which marked its 30th anniversary this week since its debut, and was based on the chapters titled “Bye Bye Clay” and “Ghost Coast” from the first volume of the eponymous manga, <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/34c9patw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> in May 1989.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To say that the story of the Puppet Master was ahead of its time may be an understatement. The World Wide Web, essentially what flourished from the internet as we know it today, was invented in 1989, the same year that the first volume of “Ghost in the Shell’s” manga — including the story of the Puppet Master — hit newsstands in Japan. (The World Wide Web publicly launched in 1991.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069406\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg 2905w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=768,679 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=1200,1061 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=1280,1132 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=430,380 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=720,636 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=900,796 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=800,707 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=1536,1358 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=2048,1810 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=668,591 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=424,375 424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=698,617 698w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=601,531 601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A scene from Ghost in the Shell’s manga, depicting an official from Public Security Section 6 and the Puppet Master</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the manga, when the Puppet Master gets caught, an official from Public Security Section 6, an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explains that they had been after the hacker “for a long time,” and they “profiled his behavioral tendencies and code/tech patterns.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As a result, we were finally able to create a special anti-puppeteer attack barrier,” the official says in the manga. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the risk of extrapolating too much from a couple of sentences, the reality is that what the official is describing is basically what cybersecurity companies, such as antivirus firms, do everyday to stop malware. Not only do they create so-called <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/what-is-a-malware-file-signature-and-how-does-it-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">signatures</a> based on the malware’s code, but also based on its behavior and properties, known as <a href=\"https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/heuristic-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">heuristics</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are other elements of the plot that turned out to be prescient. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the beginning of the Puppet Master investigation, Major Motoko Kusanagi, the protagonist and commander of the counter-cyberterrorism unit Section 9, hacks into the network of the Sanitation Department to track a garbage truck. (These days, government hackers who work for intelligence agencies often break into large networks to spy on specific individual targets, rather than to siphon data out of the hacked network itself.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While that happens, one of the garbage men confesses to his colleague that he hacked into his wife’s cyber brain because he thinks that she is cheating on him. Right after, we find out he’s been using a computer virus he got from “some programmer.” This is a clear case of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\">tech-enabled domestic abuse</a>, or even <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#stalkerware\">stalkerware</a>, which TechCrunch has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/a-new-security-flaw-in-thetruthspy-phone-spyware-is-putting-victims-at-risk/\">investigated</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/data-breach-reveals-catwatchful-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-android-phones/\">extensively</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/cocospy-stalkerware-apps-go-offline-after-data-breach/\">over the</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/03/this-sneaky-android-spyware-needs-a-password-to-uninstall-heres-how-to-remove-it-without-one/\">last</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/remove-android-spyware/\">few</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/11/mspy-spyware-millions-customers-data-breach/\">years</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As it turns out, the abusive garbage man had no wife. His memories were all made up. His <a href=\"https://ghostintheshell.fandom.com/wiki/Ghosts_%26_Shells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ghost</a> — essentially his mind or consciousness — was hacked by the Puppet Master with the goal of using him to hack into government officials. In some way, that’s similar to what some advanced hackers do when they hack into networks that they then use to hack their actual target, as a way to hide their tracks adding separation from themselves and the final target. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Puppet Master as a government hacker, the breaching of networks to track targets or use them to then attack other networks, and a jealousy-fueled hack are not the only fascinating bits of speculative fiction related to hacking in the anime. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">John Wilander, a cybersecurity veteran who writes hacker-themed fiction books, wrote <a href=\"https://hackerfiction.net/blog/2024/august/ghost-in-the-shell-anime.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an exhaustive analysis of the movie</a> that highlighted details referencing real-life scenarios. Wilander gave examples, like hackers reusing known exploits or malware to make attribution more difficult, investigating malware without alerting the authors and infecting yourself with it, and using computers for industrial espionage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obviously, the manga and anime take the basic — and realistic — premise of the Puppet Master as a hacker into more fantastical directions. The hacker, which turns out to be an advanced artificial intelligence, can control humans through their cyber-brains, and is self-aware to the point that — spoiler alert — it asks for political asylum and ends up proposing to Kusanagi to fuse their “<a href=\"https://ghostintheshell.fandom.com/wiki/Ghosts_%26_Shells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ghosts</a>,” essentially their minds.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3069409\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png 1918w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=1200,650 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=1280,693 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=430,233 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=720,390 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=900,488 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=800,433 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=1536,832 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=668,362 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=1139,617 1139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=708,384 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ghost-in-the-shell-puppet-master-kusanagi-2.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A screenshot of “Ghost in the Shell,” in particular the scene where the Puppet Master and Major Kusanagi fuse</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot/YouTube</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To understand how prophetic “Ghost in the Shell” was, it’s crucial to put it in its historical context. In 1989 and 1995, cybersecurity wasn’t even a word yet, although the term “<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-william-gibson-invented-cyberspace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cyberspace</a>” had been famously coined by sci-fi author William Gibson in his classic book, “Neuromancer.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Computer security, or information security, however, was already a reality, and had been for a couple of decades, but it was an extremely niche specialty within computer science. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first computer virus is believed to be the <a href=\"http://history-computer.com/inventions/the-first-computer-virus-of-bob-thomas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Creeper</a> worm, which was unleashed in 1971 on the Arpanet, the government-developed network that became the internet’s forerunner. A handful of other viruses and worms wreaked havoc after that, before they became ubiquitous once the internet and the World Wide Web became a reality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the very first documented government espionage campaign on the internet was the one discovered by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meet-the-mad-scientist-who-wrote-the-book-on-how-to-hunt-hackers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Clifford Stoll</a>, an astronomer by training who also managed the computers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. In 1986, Stoll noticed a 75 cent accounting error in the network, which eventually led him to discover that a hacker had broken into the lab’s systems. In the end, the hacker was identified and found to have been feeding information from the lab and other U.S. government networks to the Soviet Union’s KGB. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stoll immortalized his months-long scrupulous and painstaking investigation in the book “<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-cuckoo-s-egg-tracking-a-spy-through-the-maze-of-computer-espionage-cliff-stoll/9a157601faf83fc7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Cuckoo’s Egg</a>,” a first person account that reads like a very detailed and extensive report by security researchers analyzing a hacking campaign carried out by government hackers. “The Cuckoo’s Egg” has since become a classic, but it’s probably fair to say it didn’t exactly hit the mainstream when it was released. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As far as I can tell, “Ghost in the Shell” creator Masamune Shirow never spoke about what real-life events inspired the hacking plot points in the manga. But it’s clear that he was paying attention to what, at the time, was a hidden world that was alien to most people on Earth, who were still years away from being online, let alone being aware of the existence of hackers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Anthony Sardain began developing <a href=\"https://cavela.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cavela</a> in 2023, an AI startup that helps brands automate supplier sourcing, he did not foresee that new tariffs would drive customers to become increasingly wary of manufacturing products in China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You don’t just walk into Vietnam and build up a supply chain,” Sardain told TechCrunch. “A lot of brands find one supplier, and they hang on for the rest of their life, because they really don’t want to lose it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s especially true for small and midsize companies that lack dedicated, global sourcing departments. Sardain claims that Cavela solves this problem through its AI agents, software tools that perform tasks autonomously and, in this case, act as a personal procurement team. These agents can find potential suppliers in over 40 countries and negotiate product specifications and pricing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, Cavela announced that it raised $6.6 million in seed funding co-led by XYZ Venture Capital and Susa Ventures, with participation from Crossover Capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finding suppliers and negotiating pricing with them is an inherently arcane, time-consuming process, and, according to Sardain, it was impossible to automate without generative AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Making products involves a lot of text data, image data, diagrams, sketches, photos. This is the kind of data that didn’t play nice with technology up until AI,” Sardain said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest LLM and image models allow brands to upload their complete product information, including specifications, blueprints, and all other details about the item they want produced, directly into Cavela’s AI agent. Based on those particulars, the agent identifies dozens of potential manufacturers and then instantly contacts those factories via WhatsApp, email, or text to understand production capacity and lead times and to collect pricing quotes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sardain claims the entire process is seamless, sparing brands from sending hundreds of messages back and forth. “They log in a couple of days later, and there are quotes in their inbox,” he said. Companies then typically ask a shortlist of potential suppliers to send product samples, which aids in selecting one or more factories for final production.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cavela estimates that its customers not only substantially reduce the time spent searching for manufacturing partners, but they also save an average of 35% on production costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you get 100 quotes, you’re going to, by chance, land on a much lower price, and you’re also going to get a much better supplier in the process,” Sardain said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cavela’s customers, including fire-resistant apparel brand Western Welder Outfitting and men’s grooming brand The Longhairs, report that the startup helped them find manufacturers who produce goods at a significantly lower cost — even below pre-tariff pricing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sardain, a former data science lead for the data analysis startup Tierra, traces his knowledge of trade and sourcing back three generations within his family. He grew up living across Asian trade centers, including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, and mainland China, which gave him a valuable understanding of how local manufacturers approach their work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cavela’s competitors include Alibaba, which connects brands to thousands of manufacturers in China, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/pietra-creators-dtc-commerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pietra</a>, a brand operations startup that similarly helps businesses source goods with the help of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">January Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Throughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Yet, many users struggle to connect this trove of data in a meaningful way and actually use it to improve their health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.functionhealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Function Health</a>, which offers a regular lab testing service to help people track their health, wants to change that by consolidating health data and making it usable for its customers by connecting that data to an AI model. To further that effort, the company recently raised $298 million in a Series B round led by Redpoint Ventures at a valuation of $2.5 billion. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding round also saw participation from a16z; Aglaé Ventures; Alumni Ventures; NBA athletes Allen Crabbe, Blake Griffin, and Taylor Griffin; Battery Ventures; Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ investment firm, NFDG; and Roku founder Anthony Wood. The round brings the company’s total capital raised to $350 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the funding, Function unveiled Medical Intelligence Lab, an effort to build a “medical intelligence” generative AI model that can be used to provide personalized health insights based on users’ data, content, and research. The company said the model is trained by doctors. For its customers, the company is offering an AI chatbot that can answer questions based on their health data and can tap their previous lab results, doctor’s notes, and scans to provide tailored guidance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is not good enough to be in a world where AI exists and not be applying it to your health,” Jonathan Swerdlin, CEO and co-founder of Function, told TechCrunch. “You should be able to manage your biology. The objective of Function Health is to apply the best available technology to human health.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swerdlin noted the platform meets HIPAA standards, fully encrypts user data, and never sells personal information. “Your data and your identity are never for sale. Every bit of your information is fully encrypted and protected. We are committed to keeping you, and your data, safe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Function’s chief medical scientist, Dr. Dan Sodickson, and its co-founder and chief medical officer Dr. Mark Hyman, are together leading development of MI Lab and its team of doctors, researchers, and engineers. The MI model is trained by doctors and they stay involved in the process, Swerdlin said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the space has many players, Function sets itself apart from competitors like Superpower, Neko Health, and InsideTracker thanks to its device-agnostic approach, Swerdlin said, adding that the platform integrates lab testing, diagnostics, and clinical insights to offer more than a typical AI coach or wellness app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Function members “can get lab tests done at 2,000 Quest locations”, he added. Function says it has completed more than 50 million lab tests since 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em> </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated to reflect that Function members can access tests at 2,000 quest locations.</em> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/ai-music-platform-suno-valued-at-2-45-billion-b6bda919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It previously raised a <a href=\"https://suno.com/blog/fundraising-announcement-may-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$125 million Series B in May 2024</a>, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/labels-fire-back-at-sunos-attempt-to-dismiss-youtube-stream-ripping-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a suit by three major record labels</a> — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But given Suno’s market success, growth, and the obvious potential market for AI-generated music, its legal complications are a shoulder shrug to investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Type an idea, click Create, and suddenly, you’re not just imagining music — you’re making it. That shift from listener to creator? That’s what Suno unlocks,” the Menlo VCs who backed the startup describe in <a href=\"https://menlovc.com/perspective/the-future-of-music-is-participatory-leading-sunos-series-c/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">their blog post</a> about the investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Menlo didn’t just like the tech, but also that Suno has grown largely through word of mouth — people sharing songs on their group texts, the investors said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No doubt the AI industry is, and will continue, to eventually work out the legal ramifications of acting first, asking for permission later, over training data. But before that’s settled, the era of AI-generated music has clearly arrived.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
