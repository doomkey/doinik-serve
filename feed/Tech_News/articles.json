            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok on Wednesday announced the launch of a new “Local Feed” in the U.S. version of the app, which displays content related to travel, news, events, shopping, and dining near the user’s current location. The feed’s arrival comes shortly after a change in TikTok’s terms of service under the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-finalizes-deal-to-create-new-us-entity-and-avoid-ban/\">new U.S. joint venture</a>, which said that the app would begin to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\">collect precise location information</a> from TikTok users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, TikTok confirms the reason it’s now asking for more accurate location information is to help power the Local Feed. However, it notes that users will be able to control whether or not precise location sharing is on, and the default will be set to “off,” making this an opt-in experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Local Feed had rolled out in December to select European markets, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/tiktok-rolls-out-a-nearby-feed-to-display-local-content-in-select-countries/\">including</a> the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company explains in its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://usdsjv.tiktok.com/Introducing-the-Local-Feed\">announcement</a> that the feed is meant to help users stay connected to their local community, and its posts are shown to people based on their location, the content’s topic, and when the content was posted. This makes it a more current feed of local information — like suggestions of new restaurants to try, local events, shopping suggestions, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature also ties into TikTok’s push to attract small businesses to its app, not only as content producers but as advertisers. This could help insulate it against further regulation and help it to claim, as Meta does, that it should not be reigned in because so many <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/04/hoping-to-stall-a-ban-tiktok-says-it-generated-14-7b-for-us-small-businesses-last-year/\">small businesses rely on its services</a> to reach their customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok notes that 7.5 million businesses currently use the app to reach global customers, and these businesses support more than 28 million workers, per a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/oxford-economics-us-jobs-impact-report?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2025 Oxford Economics report</a>. The company also highlighted figures from the <a href=\"https://sbecouncil.org/2025/11/27/the-tiktok-boost-to-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council</a>, which found that 84% of TikTok small business users said the platform helped grow their business, and 75% said TikTok helped them reach customers beyond their local area. In addition, another 74% said TikTok helps them connect with their local community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TikTok sees it, the Local Feed will help to generate real-world traffic and sales for these brick-and-mortar stores across the U.S.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091884\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg 2132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=1200,678 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=720,407 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=2048,1157 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TikTok</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first time users access the Local Feed, they’ll be prompted to allow the app to use their location data. On iOS, for example, the pop-up request will allow users to pick whether they want to allow the activity once or while using the app or not at all. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,” the company writes in its announcement. However, TikTok would have likely seen a better reception to this feature had it rolled out the request for precise location data before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-finalizes-deal-to-create-new-us-entity-and-avoid-ban/\">its ownership transition in the U.S.</a>, or at least at the same time. That way, the app could at least point to a reason as to why it wanted to collect this additional data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, even if the location data now has a purpose, it’s worth considering whether or not the value of a local feed is worth the privacy risk. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok also notes that the feature will be available only to users 18 and older and will only collect information while the app is in use.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The bottleneck was always the same—most project management tools like Atlassian’s Jira and Asana simply weren’t secure enough to meet the government’s strict security standards.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, in early 2022, Conafay launched Integrate, a collaboration platform designed specifically to allow private companies, the US Department of Defense, and other government agencies to work jointly on classified, multi-entity projects. Last year, the Seattle-based startup won a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://integrate.co/blog/u-s-space-force-awards-25m-contract-to-integrate-for-program-execution-modernization\">$25 million</a>, five-year contract from the US Space Force.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That validation from a major agency was one of the reasons Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, just led Integrate’s $17 million Series A. Chan, known for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/02/wesley-chan-venture-capital-unicorn/\">early bets</a> on Canva, Robinhood, Plaid, and more than 20 other unicorns, told TechCrunch he invested because Integrate solves a big problem for the government and the private companies that serve it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until recently, the tech sector shunned selling to the US Department of Defense, feeling that it was immoral to create products for the military. But that sentiment changed after Russia invaded Ukraine and China began to be viewed as an adversary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This shift also means other project management companies may now want to sell their products to the government, but Conafay claims it will be technically difficult for them to catch up to Integrate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you don’t build something from the ground up with government requirements, you can’t really go back and re-architect software that exists for government purposes,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Conafay, what sets Integrate apart from its civilian-focused competitors is its ability to let different organizations simultaneously and securely collaborate on massive project schedules while keeping sensitive details hidden from other participants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Integrate is designed to handle the coordination of mammoth, multi-year mega-projects, such as the F-35 Lightning II program or the James Webb Space Telescope, where thousands of partners must stay in sync, Conafay explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While he was careful not to reveal too much about customers besides the Space Force, he did say that some of the work the startup is doing for that branch of US military involves deployments of large rockets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They have to coordinate tens of satellites on a single launch across dozens of missions,” Conafay said. “The complexity is pretty extreme, and they use us to coordinate those things.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Integrate intends to grow by selling its software to other branches of the U.S. military, including the Navy, the Army, and the intelligence community, as well as to the private companies that serve them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At parties, for example, she’s the one helping people with their phone privacy configurations. “It got to a point where I realized the best way to actually protect consumer data is to help secure the enterprises that hold the world’s data.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So she launched a company called Complyance to do just that. On Wednesday, the company announced a $20 million Series A led by GV. Complyance is an app that companies integrate into their existing tech stack. It uses AI agents to help them manage governance, risk, and, well, data compliance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AI basically automates a number of manual tasks,” Kaul said. “It uses AI to do custom checks on data coming in against their own specific criteria and risk thresholds.” The AI then flags any risks that need review. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These risk reviews can take weeks or months when done manually. It’s a standard audit-based process that happens perhaps once a year or once a quarter, where teams will run a check on their organization. Tools like Complyance hope to make this process more efficient by using technology to run continuous checks in seconds, so companies never have to wonder if they are in data compliance. It also has an agent that assesses the risk of any third-party vendors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re trying to redefine what enterprise GRC teams spend their time doing right now,” she said, adding that it’s usually chasing down mundane tasks. GRC refers to general, risk, and compliance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in the market include Archer, ServiceNow GRC, and OneTrust. She said her company differs from incumbents because it is AI-native, rather than layering AI features on top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kaul declined to say how many customers the company has, but noted that it works with a few Fortune 500 companies. Complyance has raised $28 million in funding to date. Though the company came out of stealth in 2023, its first product didn’t go to market until the end of 2024. Kaul called fundraising “kind of a fairy tale,” because GV actually approached her.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’ve been looking for an enterprise-grade AI-led product in the space that was winning over enterprise clients, and we were doing that,” Kaul said. Others in this latest Series A round include Speedinvest, Everywhere Ventures, and angel investors from Anthropic and Mastercard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh capital will be used to help with go-to-market expansion, Kaul said. She wants to release 30 more purpose-built agents on top of the 16 the product already has. The goal is to help make the lives and work of GRCs much easier. After all, they didn’t sign up to chase down mundane tasks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They signed up to help protect their businesses and help protect their business customers,” she said. “By redefining some of those workflows and redefining how work gets done, we’re able to unblock them to help them focus on those strategic priorities.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now it has raised another $520 million from earlier investors Google, Mercedes-Benz, and B Capital, alongside some new investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it may sound like the startup is just selling off ever bigger chunks of itself at its Series A price, that’s not exactly what’s happening. The company says its investors have paid progressively more for shares in each subsequent extension — valuing it at roughly triple the initial Series A valuation of around $1.75 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why not just call this a Series B then? The company says it is still in early stages of development and was not actively seeking funding —  rather it was dealing with inbound interest, says a source close to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fair enough. Another $520 million in a year, especially at a higher valuation, would be hard to turn away, particularly for tech as expensive to build as bipedal robots. Closely watched competitor Figure AI, for instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">had raised nearly $2 billion total</a> since its 2022 founding before announcing a further $1 billion round last fall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the excitement over Apptronik is that it has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apptronik.com/news-collection/apptronik-partners-with-google-deepmind-robotics\">partnered with Google DeepMind</a>, as well as GXO and Mercedes-Benz, to deliver what the industry calls embodied AI — robots capable of perceiving their environment and taking physical action based on reasoning, rather than just following fixed instructions. The robot is being built for tasks like unloading trailers, picking warehouse inventory, and tending machinery, the company says.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite retaining the early-stage funding label, Apptronik is no Johnny-come-lately to this field. As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/apptronik-raises-350m-to-build-humanoid-robots-with-help-from-google/\">we’ve previously reported</a>, its humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years before the company was formally founded.

A new company called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.meridian.ai/\">Meridian</a> has emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken several hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was led by Andressen Horowitz and the General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Litquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Excel agents have been <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT0lDFDprIg\">a popular target for AI startups</a>, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agents <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shortcut.ai/\">like Shortcut AI</a> built agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Ling describes it, Meridian’s biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you go to ten different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you’ll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that’s totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, the Meridian team has done significant work to make their outputs more auditable and deterministic, while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-based tools. The result is a mixture of agentic AI and more conventional tooling, minimizing the hallucinations that slow down many enterprise deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to really remove the doubt layer right from the LLM process,” Ling says. “You know exactly how the logic flows, and all of these assumptions or whatever that go into the model, you can see exactly where they’re coming from.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Samsung will likely opt for its own Exynos 2600 processor in other regions. The distinction matters, but increasingly less so. Snapdragon processors have historically outperformed Samsung’s Exynos chips in benchmarks and thermal efficiency, but the performance gap has been narrowing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a report from the tech site <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-samsung-25w-wireless-charger-galaxy-s26-photos/?utm_source=relatednews\">SamMobile</a>, the S26 will also have a 5,100 mAh (milliamp-hour, a standard unit of battery capacity) battery and will support 60W wired charging along and 25W wireless charging.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to phones, Samsung is likely to release updated Galaxy Buds 4 wireless earbuds. The company plans to update the design from the previous generation, which drew widespread comparisons to Apple’s AirPods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The event will begin at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET/ 7 PM CET, and will be streamed live on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.samsung.com/\">Samsung’s website</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/l8iOk6kkuuQ\">its YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Samsung is offering a $30 promotional credit to anyone who <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/?r=true&amp;referrer=usnewsroom\">pre-registers interest</a> it its upcoming devices.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday night, Elon Musk gathered the employees of xAI for an all-hands meeting. Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company, and specifically, how it relates to the moon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to The New York Times, which reports that it <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/elon-musk-lunar-factory.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">heard the meeting</a>, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. “You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What Musk didn’t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\">xAI-SpaceX </a>entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. “If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. That brings the total to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/nearly-half-of-xais-founding-team-has-now-left-the-company/\">six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company</a>. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/spacexs-ipo-could-open-the-floodgates-and-secondaries-are-booming-in-the-meantime/\">SpaceX IPO</a> reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something very powerful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/who-gets-to-inherit-the-stars-a-space-ethicist-on-what-were-not-talking-about/\">last month</a>, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon <em>is</em> the moon.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for comment and also contacted an email that appears to be associated with Beiermeister; neither had responded at the time of publication.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the Journal’s report, Beiermeister’s termination came after she expressed criticism of a planned ChatGPT feature dubbed “adult mode.” The new mode would introduce erotica into the chatbot user experience. Fidji Simo, who serves as OpenAI’s CEO of Applications — a role overseeing the company’s consumer-facing products — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/842657/openai-chatgpt-adult-mode-debut-q1-2026\">has told</a> reporters that the new feature is planned to launch during the first quarter of this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beiermeister and others at the company have raised concerns about how the new “adult” feature could potentially impact certain users, according to the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI reportedly said that Beiermeister, who was fired following a leave of absence, had “made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beiermeister’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbeiermeister/\">LinkedIn profile</a> says she previously worked for four years on Meta’s product team and spent more than seven years working for Palantir.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/jimmybajimmyba/status/2021374875793801447?s=12\">read in part</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of <a href=\"https://observer.com/2023/07/elon-musk-launches-xai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the company’s 12-person founding team</a> have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/elon-musks-xai-loses-co-founder-igor-babuschkin-for-venture-firm.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">left to found a venture firm</a>, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, <a href=\"https://x.com/TheGregYang/status/2013652609455006006\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">citing health issues</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bizarre behavior</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/17/groks-white-genocide-responses-show-gen-ai-tampered-with-at-will.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">apparent internal tampering</a> — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that <a href=\"https://counterhate.com/research/grok-floods-x-with-sexualized-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">flooded the platform with deepfake pornography</a>, sparking slow-moving but real <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/eu-investigates-musks-ai-chatbot-grok-over-sexual-deepfakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legal consequences</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/elon-musk-is-getting-serious-about-orbital-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spinning up plans for orbital data centers</a>, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-discusses-ai-content-marketplace-publishers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently <a href=\"https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/february-2026/building-toward-a-sustainable-content-economy-for-the-agentic-web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched</a> what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/all-the-media-companies-that-have-licensing-deals-with-openai-so-far\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">content-licensing partnerships</a> with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/judge-rejects-anthropics-record-breaking-15-billion-settlement-for-ai-copyright-lawsuit-033512498.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a monsoon of lawsuits</a>, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2026/02/senate-bill-ai-training-models-copyright-1236714135/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">are being proposed all the time</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Media publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/ai-summaries-causing-devastating-drop-in-online-news-audiences-study-finds#:~:text=6%20months%20old-,AI%20summaries%20cause%20'devastating'%20drop%20in%20audiences%2C%20online%20news,delivered%20below%20an%20AI%20overview.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">One recent study</a> claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites.

But the sibling duo used AI music in their rhythm dance program, which doesn’t break any official rules, but serves as a depressing symbol of how absolutely cooked we are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Mrázek spun his sister in a crazy cartwheel-lift-sort-of-move that made them look superhuman, one of the NBC commentators mentioned in passing, “This is AI generated, this first part,” referring to the music. Somehow, that admission is even more baffling than the gravity-defying tricks that the siblings showed off on the pressure of Olympic ice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Olympic ice dance competition is split into two events: the rhythm dance, where pairs must perform a routine that meets a specific theme, and the free dance. This season’s theme is “The Music, Dance Styles, and Feeling of the 1990s.” British ice dancing duo Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson paid tribute to the Spice Girls, while United States favorites Madison Chock and Evan Bates skated to a Lenny Kravitz medley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, for whatever reason — licensing issues? — Mrázková and Mrázek danced to a routine with music that’s half AC/DC and half AI. It’s weird. What’s even weirder is that this isn’t the duo’s first use of AI, nor is it the first time that this choice backfired.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the International Skating Union, the governing body that oversees competitive ice skating, the <a href=\"https://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00110767.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">duo’s music choice</a> for the rhythm dance this season has been “One Two by AI (of 90s style Bon Jovi)” and “Thunderstruck by AC/DC.” The official Olympics website <a href=\"https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/fsk/id/x/icedance----------/qual/000100--/result\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirms</a> that the duo is using the AI-generated song for the rhythm dance portion.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Czech siblings have faced backlash before for using AI-generated music. Earlier in the season, they played a ’90s-inspired song for their routine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvKOjFqyDQE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">that began with</a> a wailing declaration: “Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz!” If that sounds familiar, it’s because that lyric comes directly from the ’90s hit “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals (which, by the way, has an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL7-CKirWZE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">incredible music video</a> shot in a Staten Island mall — the true essence of American suburbia!).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI-generated lyrics also include the lines, “Wake up, kids/We got the dreamer’s disease,” and “First we run, and then we laugh ’til we cry.” What a coincidence! Those lyrics also appear in the song “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals. The AI song is even titled “One Two,” which are the first words of… you can probably guess which song at this point.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before the Olympics, the duo changed the song, swapping out the New Radicals lyrics for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsfRhm0CcXM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other AI-generated lyrics</a> that sound suspiciously like Bon Jovi lyrics, as journalist Shana Bartels <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/follow-up-and-ai-143894585\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">noted in November</a>. For example, “raise your hands, set the night on fire” also appear in “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLD1rWuH1JA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Raise Your Hands</a>” by Bon Jovi… and the AI “vocalist” sounds a lot like Bon Jovi, too. (Not to pour salt on the wound, but “Raise Your Hands” isn’t even from the ’90s!) This was the music that the duo danced to on Monday at the Olympics, before it transitioned into “Thunderstruck” by AC/DC, a real song from the ’90s written by real people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s unclear what software the team used to generate this music, this is an LLM operating as it’s supposed to. These LLMs are trained on large libraries of music, often through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3b-over-flagrant-piracy-of-20000-works/\">legally dubious</a> means. When prompted, LLMs produce the most statistically probable response to an input. That’s useful when writing code, but means a song “in the style of Bon Jovi,” will likely end up using some actual Bon Jovi lyrics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And yet, the music industry seems at least temporarily enamored with the idea of “musicians” who aren’t totally real. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to set her (hopefully real) poetry to music under the persona Xania Monet. Now she has a <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3 million record deal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a shame that these Czech dancers’ accomplishment of skating at the Olympics may be marred by discourse around their use of AI music (discourse that I am actively contributing to). But come on! Isn’t this sport supposed to be creative? </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Amanda McMaster, the company’s chief financial officer, will stand in for the top job while the company looks for a replacement.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boston Dynamics sent TechCrunch the following statement, “Robert Playter is an icon of the global robotics industry, and the entire Boston Dynamics team wishes to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude for his leadership. From the earliest days of hopping robots, to the world’s first quadrupeds, to spearheading the entire humanoid industry, Playter made his mark as a pioneer of innovation. He transformed Boston Dynamics from a small research and development lab into a successful business that now proudly calls itself the global leader in mobile robotics. He will be sorely missed, but we hope he enjoys some well-deserved time off. Thanks Rob.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Playter took the helm at Boston Dynamics in 2020, taking over from founder Marc Raibert. Playter worked at Boston Dynamics for 30 years, where he held other roles, including vice president of engineering and chief operating officer.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 by Raibert as a spinoff from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a professor. Google’s parent company Alphabet bought Boston Dynamics in 2013, before the company was sold to Japanese investing conglomerate SoftBank in 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai, its current owner, acquired the company in 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The robotics producer is best known for its quadruped robot, Spot, which the company commercialized in 2020 shortly after Playter took the helm. The company most recently announced Atlas, a humanoid robot.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece has been updated to include commentary from Boston Dynamics. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Bucher’s name — primarily under her maiden name, Masha Drokova — appeared in the latest dump of Epstein files over 1,600 times, <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2026/02/10/epstein-vc-masha-bucher-breaks-silence-revelations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The San Francisco Standard reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He made me feel I could be safe from the regime, someone with power and connections who could shield me” from threats she associated with her home country Russia, which she said she feared after she obtained her U.S. green card, she wrote in the post.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was naive; I didn’t dig deep enough early on,” she wrote about why she agreed to work with Epstein. “I believed his story that his earlier conviction was about sleeping with a girl who lied about her age and trusted validations from multiple investors and scientists.” She also apologized to her founders, team, and investors, saying that this situation has “caused pain I never intended.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The files paint a picture of how Bucher — whose Silicon Valley career began in social media and public relations — agreed to become Epstein’s publicist in 2017, helping rehabilitate his reputation after his 2008 sex-trafficking conviction and setting up meetings between him and various journalists, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2026/02/04/how-jeffrey-epstein-helped-his-publicist-become-a-big-time-venture-capitalist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as Forbes reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The documents show that Epstein supported and encouraged her in the early days of Day One Ventures. The firm has since grown substantially — as Bucher <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/vc-queen-masha-bucher-largest-fund-150m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told TechCrunch</a>, it closed its most recent fund, a $150 million third vehicle, in 2024, bringing its assets under management to $450 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the most salacious details from the emails involve Epstein giving her money and a Prada bag, and on one occasion, asking her for nude photos — though there’s no indication whether she complied — according to <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/investor-masha-bucher-epstein-21343434.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SFGate</a>. Bucher is certainly a well-known VC in the Valley, having backed breakout companies like Superhuman, Remote, Worldcoin, and Truebill (which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/rocket-companies-buys-truebill-for-1-275b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">exited to Rocket Companies</a> in 2021), as well as others like <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/10/nuclear-startup-valar-atomics-raises-130-million.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Valar Atomics</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The whole episode is a particularly awkward one for a VC whose whole <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/why-day-one-ventures-masha-bucher-thinks-vcs-and-storytelling-go-hand-in-hand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spiel to founders is that she’s a PR expert</a> who can help them with their public image. But it’s not Bucher’s first run-in with controversy.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When younger, Bucher was known in Russia as a member of Nashi, a pro-Putin youth group. In fact, she was featured in a 2012 documentary called “Putin’s Kiss” — named for the widely circulated moment in the country when she kissed Putin’s cheek — <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/politics/epstein-putin-russian-officials-connections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as CNN reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In her post on X, she said she has since given up her Russian passport, publicly denounced Putin, and met with some of Epstein’s victims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She’s certainly not the only VC whose name has been found in the Epstein files, which is not surprising given how connected he was to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/tech-leaders-epstein-records-silicon-valley-sergey-brin-thiel-sinofsky-reid-hoffman-musk-gates.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some of the biggest names in tech</a>. The documents do not indicate that Bucher broke laws. However, she was engaged in friendly correspondence with Epstein until just 11 days before his arrest in July 2019, Forbes reported.

These legal demands cannot compel companies to turn over the contents of a person’s email accounts, online searches, or location data, but can request metadata and other identifiable information, such as email addresses, in an attempt to de-anonymize the owner of a certain online account. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike a court order, tech companies are under no obligation to provide someone’s data after receiving an administrative subpoena.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation sent a letter to Amazon, Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Reddit, demanding that the companies stop giving data to the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, in response to administrative subpoenas.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Based on our own contact with targeted users, we are deeply concerned your companies are failing to challenge unlawful surveillance and defend user privacy and speech,” <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-tech-companies-must-resist-unlawful-subpoenas-user-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">read the letter</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We call on companies in receipt of such subpoenas to insist that DHS seek court confirmation that their demands are not unlawful or unconstitutional prior to companies disclosing any user information.

Rivian is one of the companies that reportedly decided to change this on its upcoming R2 SUV, and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfReqcUJfBU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spate</a> of first-look videos released Tuesday finally give us a look at what the company has changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First off, the front doors open from the inside in the <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/2md5qhoeajym/58YFddVW81sybQaJvra4HF/5a3dae18149f7c261ff36f8f3c38cafa/r1t-my25-26-og-en-us-20250722.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">same way as in the existing R1 vehicles</a>. There is an electronic button that opens the door, and there’s a manual door-release latch tucked into the front part of the interior handle.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rear doors also have an electronic button, as well as a change to the rear manual release. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On R1 vehicles, passengers have to first pull a panel off the door to access a “release cord” that operates the manual latch. On the new R2 SUV, Rivian moved this release cord to that same front-of-the-handle position as the front seat manual releases — though it’s still tucked behind a piece of plastic that must be popped out, making it slightly harder to access than the front door manual releases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The R2 SUV isn’t set to go into production for another few months, so the company has not put out proper instructions on how to access this release.

But it’s at least in a more logical spot than just being hidden behind a panel.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These kinds of situations don’t happen often.

The most high-profile example is Tesla.

However, with the growing demand for these goods, counterfeiters have learned to create convincing copies of these marks along with high-quality fake certificates. These goods are often called “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/luxury-counterfeits-handbags-superfakes-a490fb42\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">superfakes</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Holland mentioned that she spoke with maisons — established luxury fashion houses — that said some of their locations had to stop authenticating goods because fakes were becoming too convincing to reliably detect. She said that drawing on her experience in both the tech and art worlds, she wanted to solve the problem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For me, as someone who has a background in being a designer and then also has experience in tech, I saw this problem and thought about the different ways we could solve it. I think what’s truly innovative is we’ve used and combined elements from both hardware and software to create this solution that helps protect brands in this way to convey the information,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I think of counterfeiting and I think of the most iconic and legacy brands,” she added, “a lot of these brands have been around for over 100, 150 years. These brands deserve the most advanced protection to protect these designs.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Veritas worked with different designers to create a chip that is minimally disruptive to the product creation process. The chip is the size of a small gem and can easily be inserted even after a product is made without compromising its integrity. The chip incorporates NFC, or Near Field Communication — the same short-range wireless technology used in contactless payments. This means you can tap your smartphone on the item to verify its authenticity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091408\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Veritas-Photo-M.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Veritas</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Holland said that for security purposes, the startup developed a custom coil and a bridge structure. If someone attempts to tamper with the product, the chip goes dormant and hides the codes related to the product. On the software side, the product information is linked to the Veritas back end, which monitors scanning behavior to prevent fraud. The company also creates a blockchain-based digital clone of the product for possible digital art gallery shows or metaverse activities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company didn’t reveal who it is working with, but said that brands can use its software suite to get information about all the chipped products, add team members to manage items, and add product information along with the product story — details that can also be used to connect with their community. The startup said that some partners use this to engage customers through exclusive invitations or early access to new products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the counterfeiting market is big, Holland thinks the market still needs education around why it needs robust tech solutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is shocking to see that some of the shelf solutions, like NFC chips that brands are using, are actually so vulnerable and could easily be bypassed. This is the one thing most people don’t know, and we want to educate the ecosystem to adopt safer solutions,” Holland said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Veritas said that it raised $1.75 million in pre-seed funding led by Seven Seven Six, along with DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang, skincare brand Reys’ co-founder Gloria Zhu, and former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine. The company plans to use the funding to expand its two-person team.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seven Seven Six’s Alexis Ohanian said that he was impressed by the combination of design taste and technology expertise of Holland. He thinks that brands know that fake goods are a problem and are constantly looking for robust solutions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s absolutely an arms race [against fake goods makers], but we’re used to fighting those and consistently winning in tech — and luxury brands need all the help they can get,” Ohanian said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Chinese government is known to conduct regular cyber-espionage operations, as well as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/13/meet-the-chinese-typhoon-hackers-preparing-for-war/\">prepositioning for disruptive attacks</a> ahead of an anticipated invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing has routinely denied, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/singapore-says-cyber-espionage-group-targeted-telco-infrastructure-2026-02-09/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UNC3886 is known for exploiting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day vulnerabilities</a> in routers, firewalls, and virtualized environments, where cybersecurity tools that are designed to spot malware cannot typically reach. The hacking group has <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/vmware-esxi-zero-day-bypass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">targeted the defense, technology, and telecom industries</a> across the U.S. and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of the attack on Singapore’s top telcos, Shanmugam said the hackers used advanced tools, like rootkits, to gain long-term persistence to their systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In one instance, they were able to gain limited access to critical systems but did not get far enough to have been able to disrupt services,” according to the government’s statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per Reuters, the telcos said in a joint statement that the companies regularly face distributed denial-of-service and other malware attacks. “We adopt defence-in-depth mechanisms to protect our networks and conduct prompt remediation when any issues are detected,” the statement read.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The attacks on Singapore’s telcos follow similar but distinctly different attacks on hundreds of telecoms companies around the world in recent years, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/fbi-says-chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-at-least-200-us-companies/\">in the United States</a>.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Modern enterprises generate enormous amounts of security data, but legacy tools like Splunk still require companies to store all of it in one place before they can detect threats — a slow and costly process that’s increasingly breaking down in cloud environments where volumes are exploding and data lives everywhere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI cybersecurity startup <a href=\"https://vega.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vega Security</a> wants to flip that approach by running security where the data already lives, implementing in cloud services, data lakes, and existing storage systems. And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Led by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega’s valuation to $700 million, and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef up its go-to-market team, and expand globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Sandler told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military’s cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/intel-confirms-acquisition-of-granulate-reportedly-for-up-to-650m-bringing-ai-based-workload-optimization-into-its-fold/\">Intel acquired for $650 million</a> in 2022. After a year at Intel, Sandler decided to “do it big time in the cybersecurity world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That pedigree is partly what attracted the attention of Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel. But it was also Vega’s ambitious approach to security management in a market that is already dominated by one player: Splunk.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brasoveanu told TechCrunch that legacy SIEM companies like Splunk, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/cisco-to-acquire-splunk-in-28b-mega-deal/\">Cisco acquired in 2024</a> for $28 billion, have been criticized in recent years because their solutions are difficult to scale. They fail at processing the insane rise of data volumes driven by AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Splunk and every contender since has always centralized the data, but by doing that you essentially hold the customer hostage,” Brasoveanu said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, sometimes it’s easier to hate the status quo than do the work of making a switch to a better alternative, a quandary any startup attempting to breach enterprise budgets understands. That’s why Sandler says Vega’s “North Star” was to not only build a solution that is more cost effective and better at threat detection, but “to make it no drama, as simple as possible for the biggest, most complex enterprises in the world to adopt it within minutes.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vega’s approach seems to be working. The 100-person startup has already signed multimillion-dollar contracts with banks, healthcare companies, and Fortune 500 firms, including cloud-heavy companies like Instacart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only reason they would do that with a two-year-old startup is because the problem is so painful and other solutions on the market require an unrealistic expectation that the enterprise change the way they operate or do two years of data migrations,” Sandler said. “Vega enables them to just plug and play and achieve immediate detection response value.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/how-would-the-netflix-warner-bros-deal-reshape-hollywood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disrupt Hollywood</a> as we know it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix-WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-has-happened-so-far\">What has happened so far?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) <a href=\"https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revealed it was exploring a potential sale</a> after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/tv-burdened-wbd-will-struggle-cut-cord-2025-06-05/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declining cable viewership</a> and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/david-ellisons-paramount-seen-front-runner-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paramount</a> initially viewed as the frontrunner. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But ultimately, WBD’s board determined that Netflix’s offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount’s bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix’s offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Netflix recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/netflix-revises-offer-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-stave-off-paramount/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">amended its agreement</a> to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-fierce-bidding-war\">A fierce bidding war</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.’ assets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD</a> for several months. Still, the board repeatedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rejected</a> its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, Paramount <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/paramount-files-lawsuit-against-warner-bros-amidst-controversial-netflix-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed a lawsuit</a> seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-enhances-its-superior-30-per-share-all-cash-offer-for-warner-bros-discovery-and-provides-update-on-regulatory-progress-302683694.html?tc=eml_cleartime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcing </a>it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Netflix backs out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company continues to assert that its offer is far superior.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-regulatory-hurdles\">Regulatory hurdles</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"render of the US Capitol dome on red background\" class=\"wp-image-2024308\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bryce-durbin-capitol.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the unprecedented scale and market impact of the deal, regulatory scrutiny is intense and remains a significant obstacle to closing the transaction. Earlier this week, it was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/netflix-s-sarandos-to-testify-in-senate-hearing-on-warner-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division</a>, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/netflix-s-5-8-billion-breakup-fee-for-warner-among-largest-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$5.8 billion breakup fee</a>. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-concerns-within-the-industry\">Concerns within the industry</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. <a href=\"https://www.wgaeast.org/wga-statement-on-the-acquisition-of-warner-bros-discovery-by-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Writers Guild of America</a> has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told. There are also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">widespread concerns about potential job losses</a> and lower wages. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For creators and theaters, uncertainty remains around release windows. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has stated that all films planned for theatrical release through Warner Bros. will continue as scheduled. However, he also hinted that, over time, release windows may be shortened, with movies coming to streaming platforms sooner than before.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-should-subscribers-know\">What should subscribers know?</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"netflix logo on black screen backlit by red glow\" class=\"wp-image-2352994\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg 869w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/photo-1643208589889-0735ad7218f0-e1658176963387.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Thibault Penin / Unsplash</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​What does all this mean if you’re a Netflix or HBO Max subscriber? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix executives have reassured viewers that HBO’s operations will remain largely unchanged in the near term.
