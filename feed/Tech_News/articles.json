He’s pushed hard to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, not a maker of EVs. And yet, the company’s most visible products, which generate the bulk of its revenues, are its electric cars. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, Tesla EVs are advanced, particularly when it comes to its underlying vehicle architecture and software. And its driver-assistance system known as Full Self-Driving Supervised, which can be used on highways and city streets and requires hands on the wheel and the driver to be ready to take over, is considered among the most capable on the market today. But to Musk, the ultimate illustration of an AI and robotics company is self-driving cars and humanoid robots. And today, neither of them exist at any scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s first notable step toward that goal was in June when it launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Those Robotaxi-branded vehicles, which invited customers can hail via an app, have a Tesla employee sitting in the front passenger seat. But it’s still far from Musk’s original vision of a “general solution” that would allow a Tesla owner to earn money by renting out their vehicle as a robotaxi service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The clock is ticking and Musk needs to show more progress — or at the very least tease upcoming launches to keep antsy shareholders content. Which is perhaps why Tesla is embarking on this ride-hailing gambit in California.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Musk noted that Tesla would be launching a robotaxi service in the Bay Area<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1943134090179334207\"> “in a month or two”</a> — regulatory approvals being the primary hang-up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem? Tesla hasn’t even applied for the permits that would allow it to operate a robotaxi service. I checked Friday morning with the California DMV, which regulates driverless testing, and Tesla has not yet applied for the necessary permits. (A spokesperson did tell me the DMV met with Tesla to discuss the company’s plans to test autonomous vehicles in the state.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, instead Tesla has launched a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area. And yeah, users keep calling these robotaxis. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, while folks — including Musk’s brother and Tesla board member Kimbal Musk — <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/kimbal/status/1951035194984767838\">may refer to these as robotaxis</a>, they are not driving autonomously. (And if they are, it would be a violation of current regulations.) Again, Tesla does not currently have the permits to do anything beyond pay its own employees to use its fleet of EVs to drive people around the Bay Area. No autonomous driving in any way, shape, or form. You can read a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/tesla-wants-to-bring-its-robotaxis-to-san-francisco-heres-whats-standing-in-the-way/\">recent explainer here</a> that will take you through all of the various permits Tesla needs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ride-hailing launch has many folks wondering, what gives? My answer: optics.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recent chatter among some little birds suggests that the <strong>National Automobile Dealers Association</strong> is focusing its efforts on VW Group spinout <strong>Scout</strong> and the EV company’s plans for direct sales. The dealership industry group has opposed the direct sales model before. But unlike direct-sales adopters Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid, Scout is attached to a legacy automaker with a long-established dealer network.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

Logistics company Flexport had captured the attention of Silicon Valley, in part because of founder Ryan Petersen’s fallout with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/ousted-flexport-ceo-dave-clark-strikes-back/\">ousted CEO Dave Clark</a> and because of its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/01/flexport-acquires-technology-of-former-digital-freight-unicorn-convoy/\">acquisition of Convoy</a>, the former freight tech unicorn that had just shut down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s an update. Flexport has now <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/flexport-sells-former-freight-unicorn-convoys-tech-two-years-after-buying-it/\">sold the Convoy platform</a> to <strong>DAT Freight &amp; Analytics</strong>. The terms were undisclosed, although the company said it had delivered a “massive return on investment for Flexport.” Reporting from Axios’ Dan Primack suggests that, yes, indeed “massive return” is an appropriate description. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flexport never disclosed exactly what it had paid for Convoy’s tech, although reporting at the time put the figure at $16 million — a fraction of the unicorn’s previous valuation of $3.8 billion. Primack reported this week that Flexport sold the Convoy platform<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/supply-chain-deals/2025/07/29/flexport-sells-convoy-assets-dat-250m\"> for $250 million</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>AIR</strong>, an Israel-based startup developing eVTOLs,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/air-secures-23m-to-boost-u-s-expansion-and-evtol-innovation/\"> raised $23 million</a> in a Series A funding round led by Entrée Capital, with participation from existing backer Dr. Shmuel Harlap, an early investor in Mobileye. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>LG Innotek</strong>, the components and materials subsidiary of South Korea’s LG Group, is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/aeva-strikes-lidar-chipmaking-deal-with-lg-subsidiary/\">investing up to $50 million</a> in <strong>Aeva</strong>, acquiring an equity stake of about 6% in the U.S. lidar company. The investment is part of a broader manufacturing partnership between the two companies and marks Aeva’s push into consumer electronics, robotics, and industrial automation. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-notable-reads-and-other-tidbits\">Notable reads and other tidbits</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1926823\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,193 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,171 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=430,108 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=720,181 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=900,226 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=800,201 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=668,168 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=708,178 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"aurora-shared-some-notable-progress\"><strong>Aurora</strong> shared some notable progress in its Q2 earnings report. The autonomous vehicle tech company has three self-driving trucks operating commercially between Dallas and Houston, logging more than 20,000 driverless miles by the end of June. It is piloting driverless trucks on a 15-hour route from its terminal in Fort Worth, Texas, to a new terminal in Phoenix and is operating at night.<strong> CEO Chris Urmson</strong> told me what is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/auroras-autonomous-trucks-are-now-driving-at-night-its-next-big-challenge-is-rain/\"><strong>next on his list</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Elon Musk’s</strong> tunnel-digging company <strong>The Boring Company</strong> plans to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/elon-musks-boring-company-to-build-tesla-tunnels-under-nashville/\">build a 10-mile “loop”</a> that will connect Nashville’s downtown and its convention center and airport. Important side notes: This will be funded by The Boring Company and its private partners, which are not named. And this is the start of a public process to evaluate routes, which means work won’t be starting right away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Ford</strong> plans to reveal more information about its upcoming low-cost electric vehicles at an event in Kentucky on August 11. And, as senior reporter Sean O’Kane notes, the company is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/ford-to-reveal-more-about-its-new-low-cost-electric-vehicles-on-august-11/\">talking a very big game</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Joby Aviation</strong><strong> </strong>has signed an agreement with defense contractor<strong> </strong><strong>L3Harris Technologies</strong> to “explore opportunities” to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/joby-aviation-and-defense-contractor-l3harris-to-test-a-new-class-of-aircraft/\">develop a new aircraft class</a> — specifically, a gas-turbine hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft that can fly autonomously — for defense applications. The gas-turbine hybrid VTOL will be based on Joby’s current S4 aircraft platform. This isn’t a contract, per se. But it does mark progress in Joby’s bid to go to market in the defense and consumer sectors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <strong>Uber</strong> continues to partner with every autonomous vehicle company under the sun, <strong>Lyft</strong> is trying to make its own deals.

In other Waymo happenings, two of its robotaxis crashed into each other at one of the company’s staging lots in Phoenix this week, proving that the company’s rapid expansion into new cities does not mean it has ironed out all the kinks.

The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages “in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences,” Cloudflare’s researchers wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. In recent times, websites have tried to fight back by using the web standard Robots.txt file, which tells search engines and AI companies which pages can be indexed and which shouldn’t, efforts <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/multiple-ai-companies-bypassing-web-standard-scrape-publisher-sites-licensing-2024-06-21/\">that have seen mixed results so far</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots “user agent,” meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type; as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,” read Cloudflare’s post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer dismissed Cloudflare’s blog post as a “sales pitch,” adding in an email to TechCrunch that the screenshots in the post “show that no content was accessed.” In a follow-up email, Dwyer claimed the bot named in the Cloudflare blog “isn’t even ours.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity’s known bots. Cloudflare said it then performed tests to check and confirmed that Perplexity was circumventing these blocks. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent, but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked,” according to Cloudflare.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also said that it has de-listed Perplexity’s bots from its verified list and added new techniques to block them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cloudflare has recently taken a public stance against AI crawlers. Last month, Cloudflare <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-launches-a-marketplace-that-lets-websites-charge-ai-bots-for-scraping/\">announced the launch of a marketplace</a> allowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Cloudflare’s chief executive Matthew Prince <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/bernard-l-schwartz-annual-lecture-matthew-prince-cloudflare\">sounded the alarm</a> at the time, saying AI is breaking the business model of the internet, particularly publishers. Last year, Cloudflare also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/cloudflare-launches-a-tool-to-combat-ai-bots/#:~:text=Cloudflare%20has%20set%20up%20a,demand%20for%20model%20training%20data.\">launched a free tool</a> to prevent bots from scraping websites to train AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not the first time Perplexity is accused of scraping without authorization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, news outlets, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/\">such as Wired</a>, alleged <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/news-outlets-are-accusing-perplexity-of-plagiarism-and-unethical-web-scraping/\">Perplexity was plagiarizing their content</a>.

The X owner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1951697566325981414\">announced</a> over the weekend that the company discovered the video archive for the popular short-form video app, thought to have been deleted, and is working to restore user access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vine — something of a precursor to today’s TikTok, but with only 6-second-long looping videos — was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/if-twitter-gets-into-the-video-hosting-game-it-could-be-a-wonderful-and-horrible-thing/\">acquired by Twitter back in October 2012</a> for $30 million to expand the social media platform’s video ambitions. Unfortunately for Vine creators and fans, the company fumbled the app’s potential and decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/\">shut down Vine in 2016</a> by limiting all new uploads. The following year, it was fully discontinued, though a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/twitter-just-cant-let-go-of-vine-launches-an-online-archive/\">user archive</a> remained for a time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite no longer having an App Store presence, Vine still has a place in the internet’s collective cultural consciousness. Through online compilations of the best Vines uploaded to YouTube, and through the careers of numerous creators who got their start on Vine, the company lives on to some extent, and its content continues to be discovered by new generations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk himself seemed interested in bringing back Vine after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/\">acquiring Twitter (now called X) in October 2022</a>.  In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1586918804780630016\">a poll posted</a> on the social media app, he asked Twitter’s users, “Bring back Vine?” to which nearly 70% responded “yes.” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/10/31/vine-tiktok-twitter-musk-team-reboot\">Axios reported at the time</a> that Twitter had devoted some engineers to working on the Vine reboot, but nothing ever came of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear whether Musk has any ambitions for Vine beyond getting its archive back online, however. In the same post about restoring Vine, he also touted that Grok’s new video-creation feature, Grok Imagine, also available to X Premium+ subscribers, is “AI Vine.” That suggests that his interests in video creation no longer lie with human creativity, but in human-directed AI prompting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether or not Musk will actually deliver on the promise remains to be seen, as the X post could have just been another way to draw attention to Grok AI, rather than being representative of a real effort inside the company to make old Vines available for reposting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

There are limits to how explicit one can get. Many of our spicier prompts — made in the name of Journalism! — generate blurred-out images that are “moderated” and therefore inaccessible. We were, however, able to generate semi-nude imagery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NSFW content is unsurprising for xAI, given the release last month of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/elon-musks-grok-is-making-ai-companions-including-a-goth-anime-girl/\">raunchy, hyper-sexualized anime AI companion</a>. But just as Grok’s unrestrained nature was entertaining until it started spewing hateful, antisemitic, misogynistic content, Grok Imagine could be poised to bring its own set of unintended consequences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/grok-video-generator-will-spicy-mode-says-xai-employee-rcna221807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC first reported</a> the existence of a “<a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1952171629485711479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spicy mode</a>” last week after xAI employee Mati Roy said in a now-deleted post on X: “Grok Imagine videos have a spicy mode that can <a href=\"https://x.com/dreamworks2050/status/1952301119608398124\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">do nudity</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The existing limitations with Grok Imagine are somewhat heartening given the model also lets you create content of celebrities — anyone from Donald Trump to Taylor Swift — and there appear to be additional restrictions on those. For example, TechCrunch tried, and failed, to generate an image of Trump pregnant. Grok Imagine only generated images of Trump holding a baby or next to a pregnant woman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s still early days for Grok Imagine, which aims to compete with incumbents like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Runway, and Chinese rivals, the images and videos generated of humans are still a bit lost in the uncanny valley, with waxy-looking skin that verges on cartoonish at times. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the generator is impressive. It produces images in seconds from a text prompt, and continues to auto-generate new images as you scroll. Those images can then be animated into stylized videos. The user interface is also seamless and intuitive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk said<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1952104431367208981?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=xai-launches-grok-imagine-video-generator&amp;_bhlid=f6bb04152b3f05dd8588deb56b7dc9a215665d7f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> on X</a> that the model would “get better every day.”</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The companies want to launch robotaxi services in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2026, pending regulatory approval. <br><br>If approved, Baidu’s RT6 vehicles, which are equipped with its Apollo Go self-driving system, will be integrated into Lyft’s ride-hailing app. Lyft CEO David Risher said the robotaxi service is an example of its “hybrid network approach, where AVs and human drivers work together to provide customer-obsessed options for riders.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft has historically centered its ride-hailing business on the United States, while rival Uber has expanded globally and into other areas, like food delivery. But earlier this year, Lyft bought its way into the European market when it agreed to acquire the German multi-mobility app FREENOW from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/lyft-to-buy-taxi-app-freenow-for-197m-to-enter-europe/\">about $197 million in cash</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition opened the European market to Lyft, which has only operated in the U.S. and Canada since it launched in 2012.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft and Uber, both of which sunsetted their own internal autonomous vehicle programs, are in a race to lock up partnerships with companies like Baidu, which have developed the technology.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has partnered with more than 18 companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/how-ubers-new-product-chief-is-gearing-up-for-robotaxis/\">ride-hailing</a>, delivery, and trucking. In this year alone, it has announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/uber-and-volkswagen-pair-up-to-launch-robotaxi-service-with-self-driving-electric-microbuses/\">Volkswagen</a>, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/uber-invests-100m-in-weride-to-fuel-robotaxi-expansion-across-15-more-cities/\">WeRide</a>, and Baidu. Last month, Uber invested <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/uber-makes-multi-million-dollar-investment-in-lucid-nuro-to-build-robotaxi-service/\">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> into EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro in a bid to launch its own premium robotaxi service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft hasn’t had the same pace of deals as Uber, but has made a few partnerships in the past year, including a plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/lyft-to-add-autonomous-shuttles-in-2026-as-uber-inks-more-self-driving-deals/\">add autonomous shuttles</a> made by Austrian manufacturer Benteler Group to its network in late 2026. Lyft has also said it plans to put <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/lyft-partners-with-may-mobility-mobileye-to-bring-autonomous-vehicles-to-the-app/\">AVs from May Mobility</a> on its network in Atlanta later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

What’s changing is that the company is separating the teams that oversee Wondery’s narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wondery is combining its narrative podcast studio, which includes podcasts like Dr. Death and American Scandal, with Audible. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: The article has been updated to reflect that Amazon denies reports of Wondery shutting down</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The aim is to generate funds for North Korea’s sanctioned nuclear weapons program, which has so far made <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">billions of dollars for the regime</a> to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not known exactly how many North Korean IT workers are currently working for unknowing U.S. companies, but some have estimated the number to be in the thousands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to CrowdStrike, the North Korean IT workers, which the company calls “Famous Chollima” using its naming scheme of hacking groups, rely on generative AI and other AI-powered tools to draft resumes and modify or “deepfake” their appearance during remote interviews. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-billions-in-crypto-by-posing-as-vcs-recruiters-and-it-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the scheme is not new</a>, North Koreans are increasingly succeeding at getting jobs, despite sanctions preventing U.S. companies from hiring North Korean workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CrowdStrike said in its report that one of the ways to prevent hiring sanctioned workers is by implementing better identity verification processes during the hiring phase. TechCrunch has anecdotally heard of some crypto-focused companies asking prospective employees to say critical things about North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, in an effort to weed out potential spies. The would-be North Korean employees are often highly monitored and surveilled, making any such request impossible and likely outing the fraudulent worker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Justice has sought to disrupt these operations by going after the U.S.-based facilitators who help <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/us-indicts-five-individuals-in-crackdown-on-north-koreas-illicit-it-workforce/\">run and operate the scheme</a> for their North Korean bosses.

Silicon Valley-based OpenMind is focused under the hood.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://openmind.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenMind</a> is building a software layer, OM1, for humanoid robots that acts as an operating system. The company compares itself to being the Android for robotics because its software is open and hardware agnostic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanford professor Jan Liphardt, the founder of OpenMind, told TechCrunch that humanoids and other robots have been around and able to do repetitive tasks for decades. But now that humanoids are being developed for use cases that require more human-to-machine interactions, like having a humanoid in your home, they need a new operating system that thinks more like a human.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of a sudden, this world is opening where machines are able to interact with humans in ways I’ve certainly never before seen,” Liphardt said. “We’re very much believers here that it’s not just about the humans, but we really think of ourselves as a company that is a collaboration between machines and humans.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenMind unveiled on Monday a new protocol called FABRIC that allows robots to verify identity and share context and information with other robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike humans, machines can learn almost instantly, Liphardt said, which means giving them a better way to connect to other robots will allow them to more easily train and absorb new information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liphardt gave the example of languages and how robots could connect to each other and share data on how to speak different languages, which would help them better interact with more people without having to be taught each language by a human directly.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Humans take it for granted that they can interact with any other human on Earth,” Liphardt said. “Humans have built a lot of infrastructure around us that allows us to trust other people, call them, text them, and interact and coordinate and do things together. Machines, of course, are going to be no different.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenMind was founded in 2024 and is gearing up to ship its first fleet of 10 OM1-powered robotic dogs by September. Liphardt said that he’s a big believer in getting the tech out there and iterating on it after the fact.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We full well expect all the humans that will be hosting these quadrupeds, they’ll come back with a long list of things they didn’t like or they want, and then it’s up to us to very, very quickly iterate and improve the machines,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also recently raised a $20 million funding round led by Pantera Capital, with participation from Ribbit, Coinbase Ventures, and Pebblebed, among other strategic investors and angel investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company is focused on getting its tech into people’s homes and starting to iterate on the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The most important thing for us is to get robots out there and to get feedback,” Liphardt said. “Our goal as a company is to do as many of these tests as we can, so that we can very rapidly identify the most interesting opportunities where the capabilities of the robots today are optimally matched against what humans are looking for.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Joby.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blade’s medical division, which transports organs, isn’t included in the transaction and will remain a separate company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal gives Joby instant access to a network of 12 terminals in key markets like New York City — notably, a dedicated lounge as well as terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty Airport, the West Side of Manhattan, the East Side of Manhattan, and Wall Street.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blade, founded in 2014, doesn’t own a fleet of aircraft. Instead, the company has developed a digital network that allows passengers to book private rides on helicopters across several short-hop routes. The service has grown in popularity as well-heeled customers seek ways to avoid traffic on their commutes from the suburbs into Manhattan, or to The Hamptons for weekends and holidays. The company, which also offers access to routes from Nice, France, to Monaco and Saint-Tropez, flew more than 50,000 passengers in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt described the deal as a “strategically important” acquisition that will support its launch of its commercial operations in Dubai and subsequent global rollout. The company said it will integrate its software, which is designed to manage air taxi operations, into Blade’s passenger service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joby, founded in 2009 by Bevirt, has been working for more than a decade to develop, certify, and produce an electric vertical take off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial taxi service in cities. (The company is also pursuing a separate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/joby-aviation-and-defense-contractor-l3harris-to-test-a-new-class-of-aircraft/\">defense-related business</a>.)

This has happened while Tesla’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/tesla-profits-pulled-down-by-falling-ev-sales-and-regulatory-credits/\">sales growth has vanished</a> and its brand has been damaged by Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Tesla/status/1952310686937190721\">said</a> Monday that its board of directors formed a special committee earlier this year consisting of chairwoman Robyn Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in order to sort out a new package. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The award they ultimately decided on involves giving Musk 96 million shares that will vest in two years, provided that he “serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla” during that term and holds the stock for five years. Unlike Tesla’s previous award to Musk, this new package does not appear to be tied to goals like increasing the company’s stock price.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Tesla’s Monday premarket trading price, that would be worth around $29 billion. Musk will have to pay a $23.34-per-share purchase price, bringing the total current value of the award to him to roughly $26.7 billion. Depending on how the Delaware Supreme Court rules on Tesla’s appeal, the package may be forfeited so “there cannot be any ‘double dip,’ according to Tesla.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Elon will not be able to keep this new award in addition to the options he will be awarded under the 2018 CEO Performance Award should the courts rule in our favor,” the company wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla said Musk and his brother Kimbal, who is also a board member, recused themselves from the process of constructing this new compensation package. Musk’s involvement in the 2018 compensation package was one of the reasons Delaware Chancery Court Judge Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/30/elon-musks-56b-tesla-pay-deal-is-unfair-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decided to strike it down</a> following a trial sparked by a shareholder lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McCormick said the process of creating that 2018 plan was “deeply flawed” because of Musk’s input and his deep connections to the people on Tesla’s board. She also criticized that plan for not including any terms that would bind Musk to Tesla for “any set amount of time” — a likely reason for the two-year pledge included in the new plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">McCormick’s decision caused an uproar among Tesla’s largest fans and many of its shareholders. It’s also what inspired the company to re-incorporate from Delaware to Texas, a state with fewer established shareholder protections written into its laws. Tesla went as far as holding a shareholder vote to “re-affirm” the pay package. But McCormick <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/judge-confirms-decision-to-sink-elon-musks-56b-pay-package-despite-tesla-shareholder-vote/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">confirmed her decision in December 2024</a>, saying the vote and Tesla’s legal arguments were “unprecedented theories [that] go against multiple strains of settled law.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: This story and the headline have been updated to reflect that the award has been approved by Tesla’s board and does not need a shareholder vote. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Meanwhile, Lightman quietly worked on a team teaching OpenAI’s models to solve high school math competitions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today that team, known as MathGen, is considered instrumental to OpenAI’s industry-leading effort to create AI reasoning models: the core technology behind AI agents that can do tasks on a computer like a human would.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We were trying to make the models better at mathematical reasoning, which at the time they weren’t very good at,” Lightman told TechCrunch, describing MathGen’s early work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s models are far from perfect today — the company’s latest AI systems <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/\">still hallucinate</a> and its agents <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/browser-haunted-by-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">struggle with complex tasks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But its state-of-the-art models have improved significantly on mathematical reasoning.

But it would take years for OpenAI to develop the necessary models and training techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2018, OpenAI pioneered its first large language model in the GPT series, pretrained on massive amounts of internet data and a large clusters of GPUs. GPT models excelled at text processing, eventually leading to ChatGPT, but struggled with basic math. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took until 2023 for OpenAI to achieve a breakthrough, initially dubbed “Q*” and then “Strawberry,” by combining LLMs, RL, and a technique called test-time computation. The latter gave the models extra time and computing power to plan and work through problems, verifying its steps, before providing an answer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This allowed OpenAI to introduce a new approach called “chain-of-thought” (CoT), which improved AI’s performance on math questions the models hadn’t seen before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I could see the model starting to reason,” said El Kishky. “It would notice mistakes and backtrack, it would get frustrated. It really felt like reading the thoughts of a person.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though individually these techniques weren’t novel, OpenAI uniquely combined them to create Strawberry, which directly led to the development of o1. OpenAI quickly identified that the planning and fact checking abilities of AI reasoning models could be useful to power AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We had solved a problem that I had been banging my head against for a couple of years,” said Lightman. “It was one of the most exciting moments of my research career.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scaling-reasoning\">Scaling reasoning</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With AI reasoning models, OpenAI determined it had two new axes that would allow it to improve AI models: using more computational power during the post-training of AI models, and giving AI models more time and processing power while answering a question.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI, as a company, thinks a lot about not just the way things are, but the way things are going to scale,” said Lightman.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after the 2023 Strawberry breakthrough, OpenAI spun up an “Agents” team led by OpenAI researcher Daniel Selsam to make further progress on this new paradigm, two sources told TechCrunch. Although the team was called “Agents,”  OpenAI didn’t initially differentiate between reasoning models and agents as we think of them today. The company just wanted to make AI systems capable of completing complex tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, the work of Selsam’s Agents team became part of a larger project to develop the o1 reasoning model, with leaders including OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, chief research officer Mark Chen, and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Ilya Sutskever, Russian Israeli-Canadian computer scientist and co-founder and Chief Scientist of OpenAI.\" class=\"wp-image-2797714\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/019A7E29-3482-4F68-9A29-624BA22F0334.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Ilya Sutskever, Russian Israeli-Canadian computer scientist and co-founder and Chief Scientist of OpenAI, speaks at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv on June 5, 2023.

Throughout OpenAI’s history, researchers have had to negotiate with company leaders to obtain resources; demonstrating breakthroughs was a surefire way to secure them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the core components of OpenAI is that everything in research is bottom up,” said Lightman. “When we showed the evidence [for o1], the company was like, ‘This makes sense, let’s push on it.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some former employees say that the startup’s mission to develop AGI was the key factor in achieving breakthroughs around AI reasoning models. By focusing on developing the smartest-possible AI models, rather than products, OpenAI was able to prioritize o1 above other efforts. That type of large investment in ideas wasn’t always possible at competing AI labs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to try new training methods proved prescient. By late 2024, several leading AI labs started seeing<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/\"> diminishing returns</a> on models created through traditional pretraining scaling. Today, much of the AI field’s momentum comes from advances in reasoning models.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-mean-for-an-ai-to-reason\"><strong>What does it mean for an AI to “reason?”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, the goal of AI research is to recreate human intelligence with computers. Since the launch of o1, ChatGPT’s UX has been filled with more human-sounding features such as “thinking” and “reasoning.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked whether OpenAI’s models were truly reasoning, El Kishky hedged, saying he thinks about the concept in terms of computer science. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re teaching the model how to efficiently expend compute to get an answer. So if you define it that way, yes, it is reasoning,” said El Kishky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightman takes the approach of focusing on the model’s results and not as much on the means or their relation to human brains.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"The OpenAI logo on screen at their developer day stage.\" class=\"wp-image-2625161\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=1200,802 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=1280,855 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=900,601 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=561,375 561w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=924,617 924w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img_5619.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The OpenAI logo on screen at their developer day stage.

Other AI researchers tend to agree.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nathan Lambert, an AI researcher with the non-profit AI2, compares AI reasoning modes to airplanes in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-rise-of-reasoning-machines\">blog post</a>. Both, he says, are manmade systems inspired by nature — human reasoning and bird flight, respectively — but they operate through entirely different mechanisms. That doesn’t make them any less useful, or any less capable of achieving similar outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A group of AI researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind agreed in a recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/research-leaders-urge-tech-industry-to-monitor-ais-thoughts/\">position paper</a> that AI reasoning models are not well understood today, and more research is needed. It may be too early to confidently claim what exactly is going on inside them.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-next-frontier-ai-agents-for-subjective-tasks\"><strong>The next frontier: AI agents for subjective tasks</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI agents on the market today work best for well-defined, verifiable domains such as coding. OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/openai-launches-codex-an-ai-coding-agent-in-chatgpt/\">Codex agent</a> aims to help software engineers offload simple coding tasks. Meanwhile, Anthropic’s models have become particularly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">popular</a> in AI coding tools like Cursor and Claude Code — these are some of the first AI agents that people are willing to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">pay up for</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, general purpose AI agents like OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt/\">ChatGPT Agent</a> and Perplexity’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">Comet</a> struggle with many of the complex, subjective tasks people want to automate. When trying to use these tools for online shopping or finding a long-term parking spot, I’ve found the agents take longer than I’d like and make <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/openais-operator-agent-helped-me-move-but-i-had-to-help-it-too/?_thumbnail_id=2593103\">silly mistakes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents are, of course, early systems that will undoubtedly improve. But researchers must first figure out how to better train the underlying models to complete tasks that are more subjective.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033358\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg 8256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197821080.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">AI applications (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like many problems in machine learning, it’s a data problem,” said Lightman, when asked about the limitations of agents on subjective tasks. “Some of the research I’m really excited about right now is figuring out how to train on less verifiable tasks. We have some leads on how to do these things.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Noam Brown, an OpenAI researcher who helped create the IMO model and o1, told TechCrunch that OpenAI has new general-purpose RL techniques which allow them to teach AI models skills that aren’t easily verified. This was how the company built the model which achieved a gold medal at IMO, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s IMO model was a newer AI system that spawns multiple agents, which then simultaneously explore several ideas, and then choose the best possible answer. These types of AI models are becoming more popular; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/google-rolls-out-gemini-deep-think-ai-a-reasoning-model-that-tests-multiple-ideas-in-parallel/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/\">xAI</a> have recently released state-of-the-art models using this technique.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think these models will become more capable at math, and I think they’ll get more capable in other reasoning areas as well,” said Brown. “The progress has been incredibly fast. I don’t see any reason to think it will slow down.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These techniques may help OpenAI’s models become more performant, gains that could show up in the company’s upcoming GPT-5 model. OpenAI hopes to assert its dominance over competitors with the launch of GPT-5, ideally offering the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-openais-rocky-path-gpt-5?rc=dp0mql\">best AI model</a> to power agents for developers and consumers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the company also wants to make its products simpler to use. El Kishky says OpenAI wants to develop AI agents that intuitively understand what users want, without requiring them to select specific settings. He says OpenAI aims to build AI systems that understand when to call up certain tools, and how long to reason for.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These ideas paint a picture of an ultimate version of ChatGPT: an agent that can do anything on the internet for you, and understand how you want it to be done. That’s a much different product than what ChatGPT is today, but the company’s research is squarely headed in this direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI undoubtedly led the AI industry a few years ago, the company now faces a tranche of worthy opponents. The question is no longer just whether OpenAI can deliver its agentic future, but can the company do so before Google, Anthropic, xAI, or Meta beat them to it?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Murray, a commercial model herself, said it made her feel sad and exhausted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iconic denim company had teamed up with the AI studio Lalaland.ai to create “diverse” digital fashion models for more inclusive ads. For an industry that has failed for years to employ diverse human models, the backlash was swift, with New York Magazine calling the decision “<a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2023/03/levis-ai-models-diversity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">artificial diversity</a>.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Modeling as a profession is already challenging enough without having to compete with now new digital standards of perfection that can be achieved with AI,” Murray told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two years later, her worries have compounded. Brands continue to experiment with AI-generated models, to the consternation of many fashion lovers. The latest uproar came after Vogue’s July print edition featured a Guess ad with a typical model for the brand: thin yet voluptuous, glossy blond tresses, pouty rose lips. She exemplified North American beauty standards, but there was one problem — she was AI generated. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lala4an/video/7529605769386364191\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The internet buzzed for days</a>, in large part because the AI-generated beauty showed up in Vogue, the fashion bible that dictates what is and is not acceptable in the industry. The AI-generated model was featured in an advertisement, <em>not</em> a Vogue editorial spread. And Vogue told TechCrunch the ad met its advertising standards.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To many, an ad versus an editorial is a distinction without a difference. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch spoke to fashion models, experts, and technologists to get a sense of where the industry is headed now that Vogue seems to have put a stamp of approval on technology that’s poised to dramatically change the fashion industry. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They said the Guess ad drama highlights questions arising within creative industries being touched by AI’s silicon fingers: When high-quality creative work can be done by AI in a fraction of the time and cost, what’s the point of humans? And in the world of fashion, what happens to the humans — the models, photographers, stylists, and set designers — performing those jobs? </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-just-so-much-cheaper\">“It’s just so much cheaper”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sinead Bovell, a model and founder of the <a href=\"http://www.wayetalks.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WAYE</a> organization who <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/sinead-bovell-model-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote about CGI models for Vogue</a> five years ago, told TechCrunch that “e-commerce models” are most under threat of automation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">E-commerce models are the ones who pose for advertisements or display clothes and accessories for online shoppers. Compared to high-fashion models, whose striking, often unattainable looks are featured in editorial spreads and on runways, they’re more realistic and relatable.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“E-commerce is where most models make their bread and butter,” Bovell said. “It’s not necessarily the path to model fame or model prestige, but it is the path for financial security.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?w=584\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033586\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=129,150 129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=258,300 258w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=768,894 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=584,680 584w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=1030,1200 1030w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=1099,1280 1099w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=369,430 369w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=618,720 618w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=773,900 773w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=687,800 687w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=574,668 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=322,375 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=530,617 530w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=456,531 456w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PHOTO-2025-08-01-15-05-08.jpeg?resize=43,50 43w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">sinead bovell, founder and model. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sinead Bovell</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That fact is running in direct contrast to the pressure many brands feel to automate such shoots. Paul Mouginot, an art technologist who has worked with luxury brands, said it’s simply expensive to work with live models, especially when it comes to photographing them in countless garments, shoes, and accessories. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI now lets you start with a flat-lay product shoot, place it on a photorealistic virtual model, and even position that model in a coherent setting, producing images that look like genuine fashion editorials,” he told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brands, in some ways, have been doing this for a while, he said. Mouginot, who is French, cited the French retailer Veepee as an example of a company that has used virtual mannequins to sell clothes since at least 2013. Other notable brands like <a href=\"https://hmgroup.com/news/hm-continues-its-exploration-of-creativity-with-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">H&amp;M</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mangofashiongroup.com/en/w/mango-crea-la-primera-campa%C3%B1a-generada-con-inteligencia-artificial-para-su-l%C3%ADnea-teen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mango</a>, and Calvin Klein have also resorted to AI models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amy Odell, <a href=\"https://www.amyodell.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a fashion writer</a> and author of a recently published <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Gwyneth/Amy-Odell/9781668005774\">biography on </a><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Gwyneth/Amy-Odell/9781668005774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, put it more simply: “It’s just so much cheaper for [brands] to use AI models now. Brands need a lot of content, and it just adds up. So if they can save money on their print ad or their TikTok feed, they will.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PJ Pereira, co-founder of AI ad firm <a href=\"https://www.silverside.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Silverside AI</a>, said it really comes down to scale. Every conversation he’s had with fashion brands circles around the fact that the entire marketing system was built for a world where brands produced just four big pieces of content per year. Social media and e-commerce has changed that, and now they need anywhere from 400 to 400,000 pieces; it’s too expensive for brands, especially small ones, to keep up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s no way to scale from four to 400 or 400,000 with just process tweaks,” he added. “You need a new system. People get angry. They assume this is about taking money away from artists and models. But that’s not what I’ve seen.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-diverse-models-to-ai-avatars\">From “diverse” models to AI avatars</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murray, a commercial model, understands the cost benefits of using AI models, but only to an extent. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033573\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2343-rotated.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">sarah murray.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Courtesy of Sarah Murray</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She lamented that brands like Levi’s claim AI is only meant to supplement human talent, not take away. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If those [brands] ever had the opportunity to stand in line at an open casting call, they would know about the endless amounts of models, including myself, that would dream of opportunities to work with their brands,” she said. “They would never need to supplement with anything fake.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She thinks such a shift will impact “non-traditional” — think, diverse — commercial models, such as herself. That was the main problem with the Levi’s ad. Rather than hiring diverse talent, it artificially generated it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bovell calls this “robot cultural appropriation,” or the idea that brands can just generate certain, especially diverse, identities to tell a brand story, even if the person who created the technology isn’t of that same identity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And though Pereira argues that it’s unrealistic to shoot every garment on every type of model, that hasn’t calmed the fears many diverse models have about what’s to come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We already see an unprecedented use of certain terms in our contracts that we worry indicate that we are possibly signing away our rights for a brand to use our face and anything recognizable as ourselves to train their future AI systems,” Murray said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some see generating likenesses of models as a way forward in the AI era. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/style/sara-ziff-fashion-workers-act-model-alliance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sara Ziff</a>, a former model and founder of the Model Alliance, is working to pass the <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2477/amendment/C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fashion Workers Act</a>, which would require brands to get a model’s clear consent and provide compensation for using their digital replicas. Mouginot said this lets models appear at several shoots on the same day and possibly generate additional income. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s “precious when a sought-after model is already traveling constantly,” he continued. But at the same time, whenever an avatar is hired, human labor is replaced. “What few players gain can mean fewer opportunities for many others.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If anything, Bovell said the bar is now higher for models looking to compete with the distinctive and the digitized. She suggested that models use their platforms to build their personal brands, differentiate themselves, and work on new revenue streams like podcasting or brand endorsements. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Start to take those opportunities to tell your unique human story,” she said. “AI will never have a unique human story.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sort of entrepreneurial mindset is becoming table stakes across industries — from journalism to coding — as AI creates the conditions for the most self-directed learners to rise. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-room-for-another-view-nbsp\">Room for another view </h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033535\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg 2062w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=150,145 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=300,291 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=768,744 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=680,659 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=1200,1163 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=1280,1240 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=430,417 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=720,698 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=900,872 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=800,775 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=1536,1488 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=2048,1984 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=668,647 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=387,375 387w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=637,617 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=548,531 548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ARTCARE-AI-mannequins-7.jpg?resize=50,48 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Artcare AI-generated model.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Artcare</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mouginot sees a world where some platforms stop working with human models altogether, though he also believes humans share a desire for the “sensual reality of objects, for a touch of imperfection and for human connection.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many breakthrough models succeed precisely because of a distinctive trait, teeth, gaze, attitude, that is slightly imperfect by strict standards yet utterly charming,” he said. “Such nuances are hard to erode in zeros and ones.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is where startup and creative studio <a href=\"https://artcare.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Artcare</a> thrives, according to Sandrine Decorde, the firm’s CEO and co-founder. She refers to her team as “AI artisans,” creative people who use tools like Flux from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/black-forest-labs-kontext-ai-models-can-edit-pics-as-well-as-generate-them/\">Black Forest Labs</a> to fine-tune AI-generated models that have that touch of unique humanity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the work Decorde’s firm does today involves producing AI-generated babies and children for brands. Employing minors in the fashion industry has historically been a gray area rife with exploitation and abuse. Ethically, Decorde argues, bringing generative AI to children’s fashion makes sense, particularly when the market demand is so high. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s like sewing; it’s very delicate,” she told TechCrunch, referring to creating AI-generated models. “The more time we spend on our datasets and image refinements, the better and more consistent our models are.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033501\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png 1682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=300,266 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=768,680 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=680,602 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=1200,1063 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=1280,1134 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=430,381 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=720,638 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=900,797 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=800,709 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=1536,1361 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=668,592 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=423,375 423w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=697,617 697w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=599,531 599w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-2.56.07PM.png?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Screenshot from Seraphinne Vallora’s Instagram page.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Seraphinne Vallora</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the work is building out a library of distinctive artifacts.

Their jawlines are all the same. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Imagery needs to make an impact,” Decorde said, noting that many fashion brands like to work exclusively with certain models, a desire that has spilled over into AI-generated models. “A model embodies a fashion brand.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pereira added that his firm combats homogeneity in AI “with intention” and warned that as more content gets made by more people who aren’t intentional, all of the output feeds back into computer models, amplifying bias. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just like you would cast for a wide range of models, you have to prompt for that,” he said. “You need to train [models] with a wide range of appearances. Because if you don’t, the AI will reflect whatever biases it was trained on.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-future-is-promised-but-uncertain-nbsp\">An AI future is promised, but uncertain </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The usage of AI modeling technology in fashion is mostly still in its experimental phase, Claudia Wagner, founder of modeling booking platform Ubooker, told TechCrunch. She and her team saw the Guess ad and said it was interesting technically, but it wasn’t impactful or new. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?w=544\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3033583\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=960,1200 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=1024,1280 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=344,430 344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=576,720 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=720,900 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=640,800 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=534,668 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=300,375 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=494,617 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=425,531 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hm-ai-model.webp?resize=40,50 40w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">H&amp;M Digital model.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>H&amp;M</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It feels like another example of a brand using AI to be part of the current narrative,” she told TechCrunch. “We’re all in a phase of testing and exploring what AI can add — but the real value will come when it’s used with purpose, not just for visibility.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brands are getting visibility from using AI  — and the Guess ad is the latest example. Pereira said his firm recently tested a fully AI-generated product video on TikTok that got more than a million views with mostly negative comments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But if you look past the comments, you see that there’s a silent majority — almost 20x engagement — that vastly outnumber the criticism,” he continued. “The click-through rate was 30x the number of complaints, and the product saw a steep hike in sales.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He, like Wagner, doesn’t think AI models are going away anytime soon. If anything, the process of using AI will be integrated into the creative workflow. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some brands feel good about using fully artificial models,” Pereira said. “Others prefer starting with real people and licensing their likeness to build synthetic shoots. And some brands simply don’t want to do it — they worry their audiences won’t accept it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wagner said what is becoming evident is that human talent remains central, especially when authenticity and identity are part of a brand’s story. That’s especially true for luxury heritage brands, which are usually slow to adopt new technologies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Decorde noted many high-fashion brands are quietly experimenting with AI, Mouginot said many are still trying to define their AI policies and are avoiding fully AI-generated people at the moment. It’s one reason why Vogue’s inclusion of an AI model was such a shock. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bovell pondered if the ad was Vogue’s way of testing how the world would react to merging high fashion with AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far the reaction hasn’t been great. It’s unclear if the magazine thinks it can ride out the backlash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What Vogue does matters,” Odell said. “If Vogue ends up doing editorials with AI models, I think that’s going to make it okay. In the same way the industry was really resistant to Kim Kardashian and then Vogue featured her. Then it was okay.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
