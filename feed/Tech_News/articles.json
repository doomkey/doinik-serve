Models have mastered in-depth research and agentic planning, but for whatever reason, most white-collar work has been relatively unaffected. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s one of the biggest mysteries in AI — and thanks to new research from the training-data giant Mercor, we’re finally getting some answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new research looks at how leading AI models hold up doing actual white-collar work tasks, drawn from consulting, investment banking, and law. The result is a new benchmark called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14242\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Apex-Agents</a> — and so far, every AI lab is getting a failing grade. Faced with queries from real professionals, even the best models struggled to get more than a quarter of the questions right. The vast majority of the time, the model came back with a wrong answer or no answer at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to researcher Brendan Foody, who worked on the paper, the models’ biggest stumbling point was tracking down information across multiple domains — something that’s integral to most of the knowledge work performed by humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the big changes in this benchmark is that we built out the entire environment, modeled after how real professional services,” Foody told Techcrunch. “The way we do our jobs isn’t with one individual giving us all the context in one place. In real life, you’re operating across Slack and Google Drive and all these other tools.” For many agentic AI models, that kind of multi-domain reasoning is still hit or miss.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085292\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg 1362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,346 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,307 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=1200,541 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=1280,577 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=430,194 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=720,325 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=900,406 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=800,361 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=668,301 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=708,319 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-22-at-3.25.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Screenshot</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scenarios were all drawn from actual professionals on Mercor’s expert marketplace, who both laid out the queries and set the standard for a successful response. Looking through the questions, which are <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/mercor/apex-agents/blob/main/tasks_and_rubrics.json\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted publicly on Hugging Face</a>, gives a sense of how complex the tasks can get. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One question in the “Law” section reads: </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>During the first 48 minutes of the EU production outage, Northstar’s engineering team exported one or two bundled sets of EU production event logs containing personal data to the U.S. analytics vendor….Under Northstar’s own policies, it can reasonably treat the one or two log exports as consistent with Article 49?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The correct answer is yes, but getting there requires an in-depth assessment of the company’s own policies as well as the relevant EU privacy laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That might stump even a well-informed human, but the researchers were trying to model the work done by professionals in the field. If an LLM can reliably answer these questions, it could effectively replace many of the lawyers working today. “I think this is probably the most important topic in the economy,” Foody told TechCrunch. “The benchmark is very reflective of the real work that these people do.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI also attempted to measure professional skills with <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gdpval/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its GDPVal benchmark</a> — but the Apex Agents test differs in important ways. Where GDPVal tests general knowledge across a wide range of professions, the Apex Agents benchmark measures the system’s ability to perform sustained tasks in a narrow set of high-value professions. The result is more difficult for models, but also more closely tied to whether these jobs can be automated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While none of the models proved ready to take over as investment bankers, some were clearly closer to the mark. Gemini 3 Flash performed the best of the group with 24% one-shot accuracy, followed closely by GPT-5.2 with 23%. Below that, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5 all scored roughly 18%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the initial results fall short, the AI field has a history of blowing through challenging benchmarks. Now that the Apex test is public, it’s an open challenge for AI labs who believe they can do better — something Foody fully expects in the months to come. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s improving really quickly,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now it’s fair to say it’s like an intern that gets it right a quarter of the time, but last year it was the intern that gets it right five or ten percent of the time. That kind of improvement year after year can have an impact so quickly.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">]</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz4eMgBS0dI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an interview with Axios at Davos</a>, the AI leader was responding to a question about using ads to monetize AI services, saying the idea is something that the team at Google was thinking through “very carefully.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hassabis also said that his team wasn’t feeling pressure from the tech giant to make “a knee-jerk” decision around advertising, despite how key ads are to Google’s core business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DeepMind co-founder’s remarks followed Friday’s news that OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/\">will begin </a><span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/\" target=\"_blank\">testing ads</a> as a way to generate</span> additional revenue from the portion of the AI chatbot’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/\">800 million weekly active users</a> who don’t have a paid subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI may have been forced to consider ads, considering its growing <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/19/openai-reveals-data-center-capacity-tripled-1-9gw-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">infrastructure</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-fed-lisa-cook-trump-nvidia-01-21-2026/card/openai-to-cover-data-center-power-costs-amid-mounting-pressure-qwIQkH5ueShBs4fqq7Xl?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcQTJQn_DwM62viX4DaUkRgHbmbymDJSxi1CdwpmH5pGYDp3zlixb1yiVIKphY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69726d89&amp;gaa_sig=oxmmjSElZo7ln0MP4vXqhHKw52PJNcDaEfVqzYIkUXgR8BDxikFN9DpYIMEx7i6an0Zv9inGOyZqDc3CbDRz0Q%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and energy costs</a>, its decision could change how users view the service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m a little bit surprised they’ve moved so early into that,” Hassabis said, referring to OpenAI’s adoption of ads. “I mean, look, ads, there’s nothing wrong with ads…they funded much of the consumer internet. And if done well, they can be useful,” he clarified.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But in the realm of assistants, and if you think of the chatbot as an assistant that’s meant to be helpful — and ideally, in my mind, as they become more powerful, the kind of technology that works for you as the individual…there is a question about how ads fit into that model?… You want to have trust in your assistant, so how does that work?” he questioned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reiterating <a href=\"https://sources.news/p/googles-ai-boss-no-plans-for-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some early comments</a> from another Davos interview, Hassabis also said that Google didn’t have “any current plans” to do ads in its AI chatbot. Instead, the company would monitor the situation to see how users respond.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, we’ve already seen consumer backlash to the idea of ads infiltrating people’s conversations with AI assistants. When OpenAI last month began exploring a feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/openai-slammed-for-app-suggestions-that-looked-like-ads/\">that suggested apps to try</a> during users’ chats, for instance, people reacted negatively, saying these suggestions felt like intrusive ads. Shortly after, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/07/openai-says-its-turned-off-app-suggestions-that-look-like-ads/\">OpenAI turned off the app suggestions</a>, which it claimed were not actually ads as they had “no financial component.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But whether or not money had exchanged hands was not what made users angry. Rather, it was how the app suggestions degraded the quality of the experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s something that also concerns Hassabis, his remarks suggested. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He explained that using a chatbot is a much different experience than using Google Search. With Search, Google already understands a user’s intent, so it can show potentially useful ads. Chatbots, on the other hand, are meant to become helpful digital assistants that know about you and can help you with many aspects of your life, he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that’s very different from the search use case. So I think there, that has to be thought through very carefully,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making Gemini more useful to each user is also the focus of<span> </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/googles-ai-mode-can-now-tap-into-your-gmail-and-photos-to-provide-tailored-responses/\">newly launched personalization features announced today</a> for Google’s AI Mode. Now, users can opt into having Gemini’s AI tap into their Gmail and Photos for tailored responses in Search’s AI Mode, similar to how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/geminis-new-beta-feature-provides-proactive-responses-based-on-your-photos-emails-and-more/\">Gemini’s app just added a Personal Intelligence feature</a> that can reference users’ Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While personalized ad targeting is a business that sustains the free web, pushing an ad on the user while they’re in a conversation with an AI assistant can feel off-putting. It’s why customers rejected Amazon’s earlier attempts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/14/alexa-answers-customer-questions-with-ads/\">infuse ads into its Alexa experience</a> — they wanted an assistant, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/surprise-no-one-buys-things-via-alexa/\">not a personal shopper</a> hawking things for them to buy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hassabis said he wasn’t feeling top-down pressure to force ads into the AI product, either, though he admitted there may be a way to do them right later on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t feel any immediate pressure to make knee-jerk decisions like that — I think that’s been the history of what we’ve done at DeepMind — is be very scientific, and rigorous, and thoughtful about each step that we take — be that the technology itself or the product,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI chatbots are getting better at answering questions, summarizing documents, and solving mathematical equations, but they still largely behave like helpful assistants for one user at a time. They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp;, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/humans-a-human-centric-ai-startup-founded-by-anthropic-xai-google-alums-raised-480m-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a $480 million seed round</a> to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI for empowering humans</a>” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of Humans&amp;’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp;’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans&amp; still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/slackbot-is-an-ai-agent-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slack</a>) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of Humans&amp; and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that Humans&amp; doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said Humans&amp; is designing the product in conjunction with the model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What is clear, though, is that Humans&amp; isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$43 million round</a> at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman <a href=\"https://x.com/reidhoffman/status/2014028797507449206?s=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote on social media</a>. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the space where Humans&amp; wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a Humans&amp; co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent academic work</a> as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans&amp; will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The top risk, though, is that Humans&amp; isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives Humans&amp; a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&amp;A is certainly a risk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans&amp; told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Substack plans to add paid content previews for free subscribers in the future. The platform also plans to add audio posts and read-alouds, enhanced search and discovery features, in-app upgrades to paid subscriptions, and dedicated sections for each publication where subscribers can explore all videos from a specific creator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as Substack has been investing more heavily in video and livestreaming, as it looks to compete with platforms like YouTube and Patreon for both creators and viewers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Substack began its push into video with the launch of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/substack-is-testing-a-video-feature-which-will-roll-out-widely-in-the-coming-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">video posts</a> back in 2022.

As the court date gets closer, Meta’s lawyers are working hard to limit what can be used against the company in court. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to public records reviewed by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-child-safety-trial-ask-judge-bar-mental-health-harvard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wired</a>, the company wants to block research about social media’s impact on youth mental health, stories about teen suicides linked to social media, any mention of Meta’s finances, the company’s past privacy violations, and even things about CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s college years.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These efforts are part of a <a href=\"https://nmdoj.gov/press-release/attorney-general-raul-torrez-files-lawsuit-against-meta-platforms-and-mark-zuckerberg-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-and-human-trafficking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lawsuit</a> filed by New Mexico attorney general Raúl Torrez in late 2023. The state accuses Meta of failing to protect minors from online predators, trafficking, and sexual abuse on its platforms. The case claims Meta allegedly allowed explicit material to reach minors and didn’t put adequate child safety measures in place. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, this lawsuit is considered the first trial of its kind at the state level, scheduled to begin on February 2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s fairly standard that Meta would try to keep the case as narrow as possible. However, two legal experts who talked to Wired believe the company’s attempt to keep out so much information is unusually broad, including its requests not to mention its AI chatbots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Meta requested that the court block any mention of a public health warning issued by former U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy regarding social media’s effect on youth mental health. The company also doesn’t want surveys (including its own) about the amount of inappropriate content on its platforms. It argues that all this information is irrelevant or could unfairly sway the jury.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

By making SAT prep free, Google is trying to open the door for more students to compete on equal footing. However, it also sparks a broader conversation about the role of AI in education and just how much we want AI to shape how students learn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The adoption of AI in education is not without controversy. Many teachers worry that students might end up leaning too heavily on tools like Gemini and ChatGPT to get their work done. If students let AI do all the thinking, it could chip away at their problem-solving skills. There are even <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">studies</a> out there that <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">back this up</a>, suggesting that relying too much on AI can actually weaken students’ ability to think critically and tackle challenges on their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s also not forget about human SAT tutors. Free AI-powered exam prep poses a significant threat to the traditional tutoring industry, which has long thrived on providing personalized coaching to college-bound students.

Second, Liu also realized that many of these founders, especially women and minorities, were struggling to fund their ideas due to limited access to founder networks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To bridge this gap, she launched <a href=\"https://www.crushitventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Crush It Ventures</a>, a wellness-focused early-stage fund. The firm hopes to back companies building across the wellness sector, including in mental health, fitness and sport, beauty, and hospitality. On Thursday, it announced the final close of a $5 million Fund I. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The wellness industry often overlaps with the health sector (like sleep and body health), making it quite hard to estimate how big it truly is. Nonetheless, wellness trends have been booming in the past few years. Gyms have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/27/gen-z-exercise-healthy-pub-gym-benefits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">become a Gen Z obsession</a>, and so have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/27/running-gen-z-boom-athletics-london-marathon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">run clubs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A McKinsey <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/future-of-wellness-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">study from last year found </a>that the U.S. alone spends more than $500 billion a year on wellness. Young people in particular have become big spenders as they continue to openly talk about mental health and burnout. The McKinsey report said that though Gen Z makes up 36% of the adult U.S. population, they are responsible for over 41% of wellness spending. This is compared to those 58 and older, who make up around 35% of the U.S. population, yet account for 28% of wellness spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu believes this area has become so popular because people are realizing that health is more than just physical fitness — it also involves mental, emotional, and social well-being. “As we automate more with technology in our daily lives, we’re valuing experiences and products that foster real connection and long-term well-being,” she said. “It’s also a reflection of shifting values: younger generations want purpose-driven brands and are craving real community.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu said she started raising the fund in 2024. Though the environment was “cautious,” she said, there was a growing interest in wellness, “especially from LPs looking for more diverse mission-driven funds.” The environment for new funds <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-venture-capital-firm-concentration-first-half-2025-founders-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is still tough </a>(especially <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2025/10/17/women-led-vc-funds-rise-equity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">for a woman solo GP</a>) as most of the capital continues to flow to the top firms.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liu declined to share the name of the LPs in the fund but said she was able to break through as a new fund manager by leaning into her network. She has a background in banking before angel investing in the gym, later joining as CFO. During her decade there, she was CEO for two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At Dogpound, she worked with founders and celebrities around the world. “I learned that brand building is not just about marketing a product or service, but about creating a space for shared experiences, joy, and genuine connection,” she said, adding that her fund is keen on helping founders build their brand and communities as they scale their businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crush It plans to typically write checks of $100,000 to $250,000, and invest in between 20 and 25 companies, she said. So far, the firm has invested in 18 companies, like the wearable tech company <a href=\"https://elemindtech.com/products/elemind?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=23139288858&amp;utm_content=784712397806&amp;utm_term=elemind&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23139288858&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9S6XYNdXN6WYfKknWVw43BgHBynB&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAj8LLBhAkEiwAJjbY7wiX6SiwUp-QRndjMZ7mA6c9DzCG6e6V2jQWPg2vjdP7mLpNGXT92xoCWaEQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elemind</a> and CPG business <a href=\"https://drinkcaliwater.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Caliwater</a>. She hopes to deploy all of the checks within the next 12-18 months. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to help close the gap in wellness funding for underrepresented founders, build stronger founder networks, and show that purpose and community-driven companies can scale and make a meaningful difference in health and lifestyle,” she said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a significant change in fortunes for a company whose CEO wrote a public letter just last year pleading for funding.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the deal closes as planned, General Fusion could receive up to $335 million from the transaction, more than double what it was reportedly seeking to raise last year before it landed the $22 million lifeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transaction will value the combined company at about $1 billion, General Fusion said. Before the merger was announced. The fusion startup, which was founded in 2002, had previously <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">raised over $440 million</a>, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Fusion plans to use the money to complete its demonstration reactor, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/general-fusion-fires-up-its-newest-steampunk-fusion-reactor/\">Lawson Machine 26</a> (LM26). The device uses an approach called “magnetized target fusion,” which works by compressing a fuel pellet until its atoms fuse together, releasing energy in the process. The National Ignition Facility used inertial confinement in its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/17/laser-powered-fusion-experiment-more-than-doubles-its-power-output/\">successful fusion experiments</a>, using lasers to bombard the fuel pellets to unleash the compressive force.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LM26 eschews the lasers, though. Instead, it uses steam-driven pistons that drive a wall of liquid lithium metal inward to compress the fuel pellet. That liquid lithium then circulates through a heat exchanger, which generates steam to spin a generator. By avoiding expensive lasers or superconducting magnets, which are required in other fusion reactor designs, General Fusion hopes to build a fusion power plant for less money. But first the company has to prove its approach is viable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, before it revealed its financial problems, General Fusion said that in 2026, LM26 would hit scientific breakeven, in which a fusion reaction generates more power than was required to start it. Scientific breakeven is a key milestone, though distinct from and easier to attain than commercial breakeven, in which fusion reactions release enough energy to export electricity to the grid. In an email to TechCrunch, General Fusion said it was now aiming to reach breakeven in 2028.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition company, Spring Valley, is something of a specialist in reverser mergers with energy companies. It previously took NuScale Power, a small modular nuclear reactor company, public in a deal whose stock price has since fallen more than 50% from its peak last year. The firm is also in the midst of completing a merger with Eagle Energy Metals, a uranium mining company that’s also supposedly developing its own SMR.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Fusion isn’t the first fusion company to go public. In December, TAE Technologies announced it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-is-merging-with-fusion-power-company-tae-technologies-in-6b-deal/\">merge with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group</a> in a deal valuing the combined company at more than $6 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The common thread connecting these deals is data centers, of course. They’re expected to consume <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/\">nearly 300% more power by 2035</a>, according to BloombergNEF, and General Fusion explicitly points to rising data center energy demand in its <a href=\"https://generalfusion.com/post/general-fusion-business-combination-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">merger announcement</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the company also pointed to broader electrification trends, including EVs and electric heating, that could increase overall electricity demand by up to 50% by 2035. It’s a reminder that, while the Trump administration has cast doubts on an electrified future, other countries are charging ahead. While General Fusion may face technological challenges, trends in the energy world suggest that if it can deliver fusion power at a reasonable cost, it will find plenty of willing buyers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: 1:50 pm ET: Added comment from General Fusion regarding new breakeven target date.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The driverless service was initially open to employees.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3085054\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Waymo-miami-map.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Waymo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">This phased approach is part of Waymo’s launch playbook, and one that is being implemented far more often than even a year ago. Waymo first opened its robotaxis to the general public in Phoenix in 2020. It expanded to San Francisco and Los Angeles and eventually <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/now-anyone-in-la-can-hail-a-waymo-robotaxi/\">opened it to all riders </a>in 2024. As the company continued to expand in those metro areas — pushing into the larger Bay Area and into Silicon Valley, for example — it also opened in new markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo opened a robotaxi service in spring 2025 in partnership with Uber <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/uber-and-waymos-commercial-robotaxi-service-is-open-for-business-in-atlanta/\">in Atlanta</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/uber-users-in-austin-are-getting-matched-with-waymo-robotaxis/\">Austin</a>, and expanded its service area in existing markets to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-giving-rides-on-freeways-in-these-3-cities/\">include freeways</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has laid out an aggressive plan to bring its robotaxi service to nearly a dozen more cities over the next year. Those plans include Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, London, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The company has already started testing in some of those cities using a mix of its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles and newer Zeekr RT vans that have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/waymo-is-rebranding-its-zeekr-robotaxi/\">rebranded “Ojai.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last October that “by the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion hasn’t been without problems. Residents in cities like San Francisco have captured video of Waymo vehicles creating traffic jams, notably during a widespread power outage in December. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has also gotten the attention of federal safety regulators.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opened an initial investigation</a> into the company last October over how its robotaxis operated around a stopped school bus in Atlanta. School district officials in Austin have shared video and complaints around the same issue of Waymo moving past school buses even when the lights are on and the stop sign is deployed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has issued a voluntary software recall to fix that issue. However, new videos, which show Waymos illegally passing school buses, suggest the problem has not been resolved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br><br><br><br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Communications encrypted in this way are generally speaking only accessible if authorities hack into a target’s devices, both remotely using government-grade spyware, or locally <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/serbian-police-used-cellebrite-to-unlock-then-plant-spyware-on-a-journalists-phone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using forensic technology</a> like Cellebrite devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement specifically mentions that the new law will cover “all forms of communications, whether encrypted or not,” and can be used to obtain both content of communications and related <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#metadata\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">metadata</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about government spyware?

But there is a specific section that mentions the need for “a new legal basis for the use of covert surveillance software as an alternative means of lawful interception to gain access to electronic devices” — a clear reference to computer and mobile spyware — to investigate serious crimes. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-state-of-spyware-in-europe\">The state of spyware in Europe</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ireland’s bid to allow its law enforcement to use spyware comes as government spyware continues to proliferate, including across Europe, despite recent abuses that have highlighted how spyware has been used to violate human rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a decade ago most spyware scandals had been largely limited to countries in the Middle East and South America, where the standards of human rights vary wildly, there have been several cases of abuse of spyware in Europe in recent years, including in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced56p5l2wwo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Greece</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/hungarian-journalists-targeted-with-pegasus-spyware-to-sue-state\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hungary</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/researchers-confirm-two-journalists-were-hacked-with-paragon-spyware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Italy</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/poland-nso-pegasus-election/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Poland</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet, spyware has been used in Europe for more than two decades. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2004, in what may be the first documented government spyware sale, the Italian cybercrime unit Polizia Postale signed its first contract with Hacking Team, at the time a small cybersecurity startup in Milan, whose name would go on to become synonymous with a data breach that resulted in the company’s shutting down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Later in 2007, Jörg Ziercke, the head of the German’s federal criminal police office, the Bundeskriminalamt (or BKA), <a href=\"https://www.stern.de/digital/computer/ueberwachung-techniker-statt-trojaner-3267584.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told a local magazine</a> that his agency was using computer spyware. Then in 2008, WikiLeaks <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Skype_and_the_Bavarian_trojan_in_the_middle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">revealed</a> the existence of DigiTask, a company that was selling spyware to German authorities for capturing Skype calls. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2011, hackers at the German Chaos Computer Club <a href=\"https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2011/staatstrojaner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">found a sample of spyware</a> on the computer of a businessman passing through Munich’s airport customs, which they attributed to German police. The hackers called the malware Bundestrojaner, which is German for “federal trojan.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, these were stories that received little public attention. A few years later, as security researchers started documenting the abuse of European-made spyware in countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, Mexico, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, and several more, spyware went mainstream and is now a relatively normalized technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some countries like Italy have legislation regulating the use of spyware, the European Union has since <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2024)766262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">attempted to set common standards</a> for the use of this type of technology in response to the scandals on the continent.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The tech giant announced on Thursday that it’s bringing “Personal Intelligence” to AI Mode, enabling it to tap into your Gmail and Google Photos to provide more individualized responses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/geminis-new-beta-feature-provides-proactive-responses-based-on-your-photos-emails-and-more/\">debuted Personal Intelligence</a> last week in the Gemini app to allow the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The opt-in feature is now starting to roll out to AI Mode to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in English in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing Personal Intelligence to Gemini and AI Mode, Google is leveraging the wealth of user data already within its ecosystem. Since users already rely on services like Gmail and Photos, Google can deliver more personalized experiences that rivals can’t easily match.

With Personal Intelligence, AI Mode can draw on your hotel booking in Gmail and past travel memories in Google Photos to suggest a tailored itinerary with something for everyone. For example, you might see recommendations like an old-timey ice cream parlor based on the many ice cream selfies stored in Google Photos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google notes that AI Mode won’t just give you a generic list of restaurants and activities; it instead provides a personalized starting point for planning.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Personal Intelligence can also be particularly helpful for shopping, because AI Mode considers the types of items you buy and where you shop,” Stein wrote. “If you need a new coat for your upcoming trip, AI Mode could automatically take into account the brands you prefer, as well as your flight confirmation in Gmail to identify the destination and timing (Chicago in March). You’ll get suggestions for windproof, versatile coats that fit the weather and your preferred look. It’s like a personal shopper who already knows your itinerary and the vibe you’re going for.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google says other questions you could ask are: “Make a scavenger hunt for [partner’s name] to celebrate our anniversary. For each location, include a hint about us,” or “I’m decorating [child’s name ]’s bedroom, give me ideas for a theme and suggestions for decor.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that AI Mode doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts and the model’s responses. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/trump-tiktok-decision/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blocked</a> Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/senate-passes-a-bill-forcing-tiktok-to-face-a-ban-if-bytedance-doesnt-sell-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Senate</a> passed the bill against TikTok, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/24/will-congress-ban-tiktok/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">President Joe Biden</a> signed it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/tiktok-sues-the-us-government-over-law-seeking-to-ban-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok sued the U.S. government</a>, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast-forward to 2024: <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-656/336151/20241227163400981_2024-12-27%20-%20TikTok%20v.%20Garland%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20President%20Donald%20J.%20Trump.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trump</a> had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been several contenders, including <a href=\"https://www.thepeoplesbid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The People’s Bid for TikTok </a>, a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/billionaire-frank-mccourt-wants-to-buy-tiktok-heres-his-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Frank McCourt</a>.

As part of a new licensing agreement, Google DeepMind is bringing on the CEO and several of the top engineers at voice AI startup Hume AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-hires-hume-ai-ceo-licensing-deal-gemini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wired</a> was the first to report the news. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO Alan Cowen and about seven other engineers will work with DeepMind to improve Gemini’s voice features, according to Wired. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s left of Hume AI will continue to supply its technology to other AI firms. No financial details of the deal were shared, but Andrew Ettinger, an investor and tech executive who joined the Hume AI team last week and has taken over as CEO, told TechCrunch that Google has a “non-exclusive right to all of our IP, and we’ll be infusing that into their processes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Hume AI would be releasing new models in the coming months, and is on track to bring in $100 million in revenue this year.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Hume acqui-hire is the latest example of a leading AI firm scooping top talent off the market and skirting regulatory scrutiny by acquiring a startup’s team rather than the company outright. Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\">Google acquired viral AI coding startup Windsurf’s CEO</a> and other top researchers, and OpenAI has acquired several startup teams in recent months, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/openai-to-acquire-the-team-behind-executive-coaching-ai-tool-convogo/\">Convogo</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/with-its-latest-acqui-hire-openai-is-doubling-down-on-personalized-consumer-ai/\">Roi</a>. The Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/us-is-scrutinizing-big-tech-talent-acquisitions-ftc-chief-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently said</a> that it would take a closer look at such deals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal also shows that voice is becoming the next frontier in AI.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hume AI’s secret sauce is its model’s ability to understand a user’s emotions and mood based on their voice. In 2024, the startup <a href=\"https://www.hume.ai/blog/series-b-evi-announcement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched its Empathetic Voice Interface</a>, a conversational AI with emotional intelligence. Hume AI has raised close to $80 million to date according to PitchBook. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Hume AI isn’t the only company working on voice-focused models. Google has been steadily improving its Gemini Live feature, which allows a user to have conversations with the chatbot. Last month, Google released a new native audio model for the Live API that improved the model’s ability to “handle complex workflows,” per the <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/changelog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gemini API release notes</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in the industry are investing big into voice capabilities as well. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/openai-bets-big-on-audio-as-silicon-valley-declares-war-on-screens/\">OpenAI is reportedly</a> preparing to overhaul its audio models in preparation for its audio-first personal device, created with Jonny Ive’s io, to launch this year. Recent leaks suggest the device could be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/\">a form of earbuds</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Meta also accelerated its AI audio push by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/13/meta-acquires-voice-startup-play-ai/\">acquiring startup Play AI</a>. The Facebook-maker’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are increasingly relying on voice and audio capabilities for tasks like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/metas-ai-glasses-can-now-help-you-hear-conversations-better/\">helping you hear conversations in noisy rooms</a> and enabling hands-free control for calls, texts, music, and photos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Voice is the only acceptable input mode for wearables,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/why-this-vc-thinks-2026-will-be-the-year-of-the-consumer/\">investor Vanessa Larco</a> told TechCrunch. “This acquisition will only accelerate the need for voice apps.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Demand continues to increase for voice capabilities. Earlier this month, ElevenLabs, the AI voice generation startup, said it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/elevenlabs-ceo-says-the-voice-ai-startup-crossed-330-million-arr-last-year/\">crossed $330 million</a> in annual recurring revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated with comment from Hume AI. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Smith</a>, used artificial composite materials called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">metamaterials</a>” to make a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2005-12-david-smith-descartes-award-material.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">real-life invisibility cloak</a>. While this cloak didn’t really work like Harry Potter’s, exhibiting limited ability to conceal objects from the light of a single microwave length, those advances in material science did eventually trickle down to electromagnetism research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Austin-based <a href=\"https://www.neurophos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Neurophos</a>, a photonics startup spun out of Duke University and <a href=\"https://metaceptsystem.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Metacept</a> (an incubator run by Smith), is taking that research further to solve what may be the biggest problem facing AI labs and hyperscalers: how to scale computing power while keeping power consumption in check.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has come up with a “metasurface modulator” with optical properties that enable it to serve as a <a href=\"https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-core\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tensor core processor</a> for doing matrix vector multiplication — math that is at the heart of a lot of AI work (particularly inferencing), currently performed by specialized GPUs and TPUs that use traditional silicon gates and transistors. By fitting thousands of these modulators on a chip, Neurophos claims, its “optical processing unit” is significantly faster than the silicon GPUs currently used en masse at AI data centers, and far more efficient at inferencing (running trained models), which can be a fairly expensive task.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To fund the development of its chips, Neurophos has just raised $110 million in a Series A round led by Gates Frontier (Bill Gates’ venture firm), with participation from Microsoft’s M12, Carbon Direct, Aramco Ventures, Bosch Ventures, Tectonic Ventures, Space Capital, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/light-powered-ai-chips-future/\">photonic chips are nothing new</a>. In theory, photonic chips offer higher performance than traditional silicon because light produces less heat than electricity, it can travel faster, and is far less susceptible to changes in temperature and electromagnetic fields.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But optical components tend to be much larger than their silicon counterparts, and can be difficult to mass-produce. And they also need converters to transform data from digital to analog and back, which can be large and take up a lot of power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neurophos, however, posits that the metasurface it has developed can solve all of those problems in one swoop because it is about “10,000 times” smaller than traditional optical transistors. The small size, the startup claims, enables it to fit thousands of units on a chip, which results in far more efficiency than traditional silicon because the chip can do many more calculations at once.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you shrink the optical transistor, you can do way more math in the optics domain before you have to do that conversion back to the electronics domain,” Dr. Patrick Bowen, CEO and co-founder of Neurophos, told TechCrunch. “If you want to go fast, you have to solve the energy efficiency problem first. Because if you’re going to take a chip and make it 100 times faster, it burns 100 times more power. So you get the privilege of going fast after you solve the energy efficiency problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result, Neurophos claims, is an optical processing unit that can wildly outperform Nvidia’s B200 AI GPU. The startup <a href=\"https://11549dc2-0dc9-4363-9a47-d257d2a497cc.filesusr.com/ugd/79aa3c_85cd1a5477d44f4fa0e423c03ad0746c.pdf?index=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">says</a> its chip can run at 56 GHz, yielding a peak 235 Peta Operations per Second (POPS) and consuming 675 watts, compared to the B200, which can deliver 9 POPS at 1,000 watts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bowen says Neurophos has already signed multiple customers (though he declined to name any), and companies including Microsoft are “looking very closely” at the startup’s products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the startup is entering a crowded market that’s dominated by Nvidia, the world’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/nvidia-becomes-first-public-company-worth-5-trillion/\">most valuable public company</a>, whose products have more or less underpinned the entire AI boom. There are also other companies working on photonics, though some, like Lightmatter, have <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/17/photonics-startup-lightmatter-details-p1-its-ai-optical-accelerator-chip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pivoted</a> to focusing on interconnects. And Neurophos is still a few years away from production, expecting its first chips to hit the market by mid-2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Bowen is confident the performance and efficiency advances provided by its metasurface modulators will prove a sufficient moat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What everyone else is doing is, and this includes Nvidia, in terms of the fundamental physics of the silicon, it’s really evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and it’s tied to the progress of TSMC. If you look at the improvement of TSMC nodes, on average, they improve in energy efficiency about 15%, and that takes a couple years,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Even if we chart out Nvidia’s improvement in architecture over the years, by the time we come out in 2028, we still have massive advantages over everyone else in the market because we’re starting with a 50x over Blackwell in both energy efficiency and raw speed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to address the mass-manufacturing issues optical chips have traditionally faced, Neurophos says its chips can be made with standard silicon foundry materials, tools, and processes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh funding will be used for the development of the company’s first integrated photonic compute system, including data center-ready OPU modules, a full software stack, and early-access developer hardware. The company is also opening a San Francisco engineering site and expanding its HQ in Austin, Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Modern AI inference demands monumental amounts of power and compute,” Dr. Marc Tremblay, corporate vice president and technical fellow of core AI infrastructure at Microsoft, said in a statement. “We need a breakthrough in compute on par with the leaps we’ve seen in AI models themselves, which is what Neurophos’ technology and high-talent density team is developing.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But as AI coding tools have gotten better, the test has had to change a lot to keep candidates from simply filling in all the answers with Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Team lead Tristan Hume described the history of the challenge <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/AI-resistant-technical-evaluations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a blog post on Wednesday</a>. “Each new Claude model has forced us to redesign the test,” Hume writes. “When given the same time limit, Claude Opus 4 outperformed most human applicants. That still allowed us to distinguish the strongest candidates — but then, Claude Opus 4.5 matched even those.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Candidates are allowed to use AI tools on the test, but the situation still presents a serious candidate-assessment problem. If human beings can no longer improve on the model’s output, then the test is only measuring the different models used and it’s no longer useful for finding top performers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Under the constraints of the take-home test, we no longer had a way to distinguish between the output of our top candidates and our most capable model,” Hume writes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue of AI use on tests is already <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/chatgpt-ai-cheating-college-blue-books-5e3014a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wreaking havoc at schools and universities</a> around the world, so it’s ironic that AI labs are having to deal with it too. But Anthropic is also uniquely well-equipped to deal with the problem. In the end, Hume designed a new test that had less to do with optimizing hardware, making it sufficiently novel to stump contemporary AI tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as part of the post, he also shared the original test to see if anyone reading could come up with a better solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you can best Opus 4.5,” the post reads, “we’d love to hear from you.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em><strong>Correction</strong>: An earlier version of this article misstated Anthropic’s policy towards the use of AI tools on the take-home test.

But it won’t be heading to the moon, as the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/blue-origin-aims-to-land-next-new-glenn-booster-then-reuse-it-for-moon-mission/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">company</a> had <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-planning-next-new-glenn-flight-for-early-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously suggested</a>. The rocket will instead carry a satellite to low-Earth orbit for AST SpaceMobile, marking the second time that Jeff Bezos’ space company has flown a commercial payload with New Glenn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company didn’t immediately explain why it chose to launch the AST SpaceMobile satellite instead of its own robotic lunar lander. The lander, known as Blue Moon Mark 1 (MK1), is currently being shipped to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Texas for <a href=\"https://x.com/blueorigin/status/2014043028445364229\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">vacuum chamber testing</a>. A launch date for that mission has not been set.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, this will be the third New Glenn launch in just over a year, after the rocket spent a decade in development. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch will come at a busy month for spaceflight: NASA may launch its Artemis II mission, in which four astronauts will orbit the moon, as early as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-artemis-ii-rocket-rolls-to-launch-pad-but-key-test-looms-ahead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">February 6</a>; SpaceX is expected to start testing the third version of its Starship rocket; and NASA and SpaceX will launch the Crew-12 mission, which will help bring the International Space Station back up to full staff after the Crew-11 team was <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/human-spaceflight/we-can-handle-any-kind-of-difficult-situation-crew-11-astronauts-say-1st-medical-evacuation-from-iss-had-a-silver-lining\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">medically evacuated earlier this month</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For this launch, Blue Origin will reuse the booster stage from New Glenn’s second mission, which happened last <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/blue-origin-sticks-first-new-glenn-rocket-landing-and-launches-nasa-spacecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">November</a>. The company recovered that booster by landing it on a drone ship in the ocean, similar to what SpaceX has been doing with its Falcon 9 boosters for years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New Glenn is Blue Origin’s first vehicle meant to regularly deliver payloads to Earth orbit and beyond, and it builds on the suborbital rocket program called New Shepard that has been in operation for more than a decade. The company has signed a deal with AST SpaceMobile to send multiple satellites to orbit to help that company build out its space-based cellular broadband network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But New Glenn is just one piece of the company’s grander ambitions. In November, the company revealed a super-heavy variant of New Glenn that will be taller than a Saturn V rocket, on par with SpaceX’s Starship. And on Wednesday, the company announced a satellite internet constellation called TeraWave that it plans to start deploying in late 2027.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also hopes to use its Blue Moon landers on missions to the moon and Mars, and has been developing another spacecraft called Blue Ring that can host and deploy payloads for other space companies.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
