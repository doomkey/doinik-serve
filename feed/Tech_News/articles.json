He said that someday, he’d ask the AI. When everyone snickered, he added, “You can laugh. It’s all right. But it really is what I <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/18/sam-altmans-leap-of-faith/\">actually believe</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He wasn’t kidding.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sitting again in front of an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/strictlyvc-palo-alto/\">audience</a>, this time across Max Hodak, the co-founder and CEO of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://science.xyz/\">Science Corp</a>., I can’t help but remember that moment with Altman. Pale-complexioned Hodak, wearing jeans and a black zip-up sweatshirt, looks more like he’s going to jump into a mosh pit than pitch a company valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. But he’s got a sly sense of humor that keeps the room engaged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hodak started programming when he was six, and as an undergraduate at Duke, he worked his way into the lab of Miguel Nicolelis, a pioneering neuroscientist who has since become publicly critical of commercial brain-computer interface ventures. In 2016, Hodak co-founded Neuralink with Elon Musk, serving as its president and essentially running day-to-day operations until 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I ask what he learned working alongside Musk, Hodak describes a specific pattern. “We got into lots of situations together where something would happen. In my mind, I’d have two diametrically opposed possible solutions, and I would bring them to him, and I’d be like, ‘Is it A or B?’ And he’d look at it and be like, ‘It’s definitely B,’ and the problem would never come back.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a few years of this, Hodak took what he’d learned and roped in three former Neuralink colleagues to launch Science Corp. about four years ago. Like Altman, Hodak describes his team’s improbable goal so placidly that I find myself believing that the limits of cognition are about to be overcome sooner than most of us realize. And that he’ll be among those who make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While I’ve been consumed with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/your-ai-tools-run-on-fracked-gas-and-bulldozed-texas-land/\">AI data center craziness</a> and the talent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/sam-altman-says-meta-tried-and-failed-to-poach-openais-talent-with-100m-offers/\">poaching wars</a>, momentum has been building in the background.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to World Economic Forum data, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/06/the-brain-computer-interface-market-is-growing-but-what-are-the-risks/\">nearly 700</a> companies around the world have at least some ties to brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, including some tech giants. In addition to Neuralink, ​​Microsoft Research has run a dedicated BCI project for the last seven years. Apple <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250804537175/en/Synchron-Debuts-First-Thought-Controlled-iPad-Experience-Using-Apples-New-BCI-Human-Interface-Device-Protocol\">partnered</a> earlier this year with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://synchron.com/\">Synchron</a>, backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, to create a protocol that lets BCIs control iPhones and iPads. Even Altman is reportedly helping to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/sam-altman-openai-will-reportedly-back-a-startup-that-takes-on-musks-neuralink/\">stand up</a> a Neuralink rival.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And in August, China released its “Implementation Plan for Promoting Innovation and Development of the BCI Industry,” targeting core technological breakthroughs by 2027, and aiming to become the global leader by 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the neuroscience isn’t new. “A legitimate criticism of the BCI companies is that they aren’t doing new neuroscience,” Hodak said. “Decoding cursor control or robotic arm control from a human – people have been doing that for 30 years.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s new, however, is the engineering. “The innovation at Neuralink is making [a device] small enough and low-power enough that you can fully implant it and close the skin, and have something that isn’t an infection risk. That genuinely was new.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, Hodak admits we’re missing a lot of information about how the brain works to really build the products that he’s talking about. But unlike a lot of BCI companies that have to raise money, Science Corp. is figuring out ways to generate revenue. On a small scale, it makes tools that it then sells to other researchers — as Hodak puts it, “taking a $300,000 cart-sized recording system and turning it into a $2,000 handheld.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger unlock is getting something to market soon. A product that can help people and make money while the company quietly builds technology that it claims could reshape human consciousness itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That initial commercial “product” is a procedure called Prima. It’s exciting enough that Time magazine <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://time.com/7330887/brain-computer-chips-future-of-medicine/\">put the tech on its cover</a> a few weeks ago: a computer chip smaller than a grain of rice that’s implanted directly in the retina. Combined with camera-equipped glasses and (for the time being) a two-pound battery, the tech restores vision to people with advanced macular degeneration. Not blurry, vague light perception, but “form vision.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In completed clinical trials with 38 patients, Science Corp says 80% were able to read again, two letters at a time. “To my knowledge, this is the first time that restoration of the ability to fluently read has ever been definitively shown in blind patients,” says Hodak.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Science Corp. can only take so much credit. It <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240425683676/en/Science-Corporation-Acquires-Pixiums-PRIMA-Retinal-Implant-Extending-and-Diversifying-Its-Commitment-to-Vision-Restoration-Through-Brain-Computer-Interface-Technology\">acquired</a> Prima from a French company called Pixium Vision last year, refined the technology, completed the trials Pixium had started, and submitted the results for approval in Europe. Hodak expects to launch the product next summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prima is meanwhile still to be approved by U.S. regulators. Asked about the FDA, Hodak said, “We’re working with the FDA, although there’s some questions on exactly the timeline for that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, at what he estimates will cost $200,000 per procedure at the outset, Science Corp. will become profitable if it manages to get just 50 patients per month.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073240\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963541430_0754aa9ec4_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-mind-is-in-a-dish-of-neurons\">The mind is in a dish of neurons</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The next, more ambitious step is gene therapy. Specifically, optogenetic gene therapy, which means making neurons light-sensitive so they can be controlled with light instead of electrodes. It’s not a new idea, but Science Corp. thinks it’s figured out what everyone else hasn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s how Prima works: Your retina has three layers of cells. Photoreceptors (rods and cones) at the back capture light, and connect to bipolar cells, which connect to optic nerves that run to the brain. In macular degeneration, the photoreceptors die. Prima’s 400 electrodes stimulate the bipolar cells directly, bypassing the dead layer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With gene therapy, the goal is to skip the electrodes entirely. Instead, you engineer the surviving cells using new proteins to respond to light. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The eye is a really ideal place to do this type of gene therapy work, because it’s kind of left alone by the immune system,” Hodak explains. In other parts of the body, engineered cells that express unfamiliar proteins trigger immune attacks. But our body learned long ago not to overreact when things change in the eye.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies are pursuing similar approaches, but Hodak says they are either targeting the wrong cell layer, or their proteins just aren’t as good as his startup’s. “They’re not as fast, they’re not as sensitive. The proteins that we’re actually using are state of the art,” he claims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, even gene therapy isn’t the long game. That is something Hodak has probably been dreaming about his entire life: a way to grow new brain tissue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Electrodes are crude; they damage tissue. “Every time you place something mechanically into the brain, there’s no free space in there,” Hodak explains. He says there’s redundancy in the cortex, and for someone with a spinal cord injury or blindness, the tradeoff is “totally justifiable.” But the tissue damage means “you can’t scale it up to millions or billions of channels.” That, he says, is the fundamental limitation of approaches like Neuralink’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adding more neurons to the brain sounds batty, but Science Corp. says it has already tested a proof-of-concept device in mice. The device looks like a tiny waffle grid and sits on the brain’s surface (instead of being pushed inside), with each well containing engineered neurons grown from stem cells. The neurons are heavily modified, optimized for specific functions. Once the waffle-like device is installed, the neurons begin growing new connections – axons and dendrites – down into the brain tissue itself, forming biological links with existing neural circuits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At least in the tests with mice, Science Corp. says it demonstrated that these additional neurons worked some of the time: Five of nine mice learned to move left or right when the device was activated.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It does this in a perfectly bio-compatible way, because the brain is really just a bunch of neurons,” Hodak said. “Just neurons talking to neurons, the way evolution intended, save for the not-inconsiderable fact that some of the neurons come from a lab.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What if something goes wrong? A patient can take a vitamin, “an FDA-approved thing that you wouldn’t otherwise take,” and the engineered neurons will die, Hodak says, describing it as a valve built into the biology itself.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-hodak-really-wants\">What Hodak really wants</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve been talking for a while when Hodak reframes everything in one sentence. “I actually think BCI is a longevity-adjacent story.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The brain does two things: the brain is intelligent and it’s conscious. We know that intelligence is substrate-independent, because you get it in both brains and GPUs. But the end of the brain-computer interface quest, I think, is actually conscious machines.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is about cracking consciousness itself; understanding the physical laws that make subjective experience possible, and then engineering it into new substrates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In order to prove a theory of consciousness is right, you have to see it for yourself,” Hodak explains. “That will require these big brain-computer interfaces.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hodak thinks that once humans understand how billions of neurons bind together to create a unified experience — what neuroscientists call “the binding problem” — we can start doing truly wild things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I almost hesitate to say some of those wild things include multiple brains working to form one consciousness. “You could really, in a very fundamental sense, talk about redrawing the border around a brain, possibly to include four hemispheres, or a device, or a whole group of people,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hodak’s basically describing the plot of “Pluribus,” the new Apple TV show where an alien signal transforms humanity into a hive mind. It’s dystopian as hell. But Hodak seems to think the basic science is… sound.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Will there be some giant super organisms that correspond to world cultures? Will there be dyads, like the next step up in marriage?” He’s genuinely uncertain how the technology will be used. “It’s kind of tough to imagine how it will get used, but I’m pretty confident those devices will get built.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basically, at the end of this path, you don’t have simply smarter humans; you have people who’ve merged with machines, with each other. Consciousness that spans multiple substrates, bodies, and minds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You could cure cancer, you could cure cardiovascular disease, you could cure all metabolic disease,” Hodak says. “But there’s this alternative view of substrate independence that just basically says, what if we didn’t need to solve those problems in the first place?” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What if, instead of endlessly patching failing bodies, we just moved the consciousness somewhere else?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-tipping-point\">The tipping point</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What makes this conversation remarkable is how concrete everything sounds. Hodak isn’t hand-waving about “someday.” He’s got timelines, patient numbers, and regulatory pathways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By 2035, [biohybrid neural interfaces] will be basically available for patients in need,” he says. “And that will start to really deform the world in interesting ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, Hodak isn’t saying healthy 40-year-olds will be lining up for brain surgery anytime soon. “These are [for] very serious brain surgeries,” he emphasizes. He does say that because people invariably age, “many people eventually become patients.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, he claims the technology will improve, surgeries will get safer, and benefits will become more dramatic. And gradually, the patient population will expand. By the late 2040s — which is not so far away — Hodak thinks the tech will be “really ubiquitous.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2035 is when things are expected to get weird. That’s when, Hodak predicts, “patient number one gets the choice of like, ‘You can die of pancreatic cancer, or you can be inserted into the matrix and then it will accelerate from there.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He tells a room full of people that in a decade, someone facing terminal illness might choose to have their consciousness uploaded and somehow preserved through BCI technology. The people in the room look both entertained and concerned.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-money-money-money\">Money, money, money</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One thing that seems unlikely to change is that a small minority of people will have vast financial resources while the rest don’t. Currently, insurance covers treatments for macular degeneration patients. But as BCIs proliferate and improve, the entire economic model of healthcare may break down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hodak’s argument is that consumer tech has good deflation. Phones and computers get better and cheaper, so we buy more of them and spend more money; the market expands. But healthcare operates on what Hodak calls “a fixed bucket of money.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The theory is that as BCI technology presumably improves and extends lives, there will be more things to spend healthcare dollars on. “The problem is that as new technologies come along that produce better outcomes and longer lives, there’s more stuff to spend money on for better outcomes,” Hodak says. “You can’t spend like 10 times as much on healthcare. This would be a catastrophe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That is like a fundamental conflict that I think is going to eventually break the healthcare system as these technologies actually work in big ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Honestly, at this point in the conversation, healthcare costs are far from top of my mind. But it’s an important point: either healthcare spending balloons to unsustainable levels, or whether someone gets a BCI is a matter of whether they can afford it. I can’t believe that class divisions based on cognitive enhancements seem like an actual, near-term economic reality, but imagine trying to compete against someone with perfect recall, or the ability to calculate something instantaneously. That would suck.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As our time is running out, I ask Hodak what he thinks might happen to society. He doesn’t have answers. “I worry a lot more about Twitter than I do about these things,” he says with a smile, adding that he’s more concerned about information manipulation through our eyes than through direct brain interfaces.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I leave the conversation thinking about “Pluribus,” which Hodak is yet to watch. In the show, the hive mind offers everything: perfect knowledge, freedom from loneliness, complete understanding. But once you’re in, you’re not you anymore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I also think about how Altman’s comment, that he’d just ask the AI, tickled a room full of people because it sounded absurd to those outside that field.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Years ago, as a junior reporter in Silicon Valley, I had the same initial response to many ambitious ideas and products. A lot of those ideas have now taken over the world, so now I just listen and wait.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company instead wants to concentrate on helping stores “achieve operational efficiency, improved margins and visibility,” he said, citing this as its primary objective.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/04/walmart-backed-fintech-giant-phonepe-makes-e-commerce-push/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched</a> Pincode in April 2023 as a major push into e-commerce, building it on the Indian government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The hyperlocal app offered groceries, medicines, food, electronics, and home décor from neighbourhood shops. It rolled out first in Bengaluru and later expanded to other cities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within a little over a year of launch, Pincode <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/phonepes-pincode-exits-non-food-categories-in-ecommerce-business-rejig/articleshow/109557723.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pulled out of most categories</a> except food. Earlier this year, the app <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/phonepe-sharpens-quick-commerce-play-in-first-for-a-payments-company/articleshow/117213550.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shifted to a quick-commerce model</a>, offering 10-minute deliveries through local kirana shops and retailers in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. The company also expanded the service to 10-minute medicine deliveries in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Pune in April.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe’s Pincode utilized local shops and retail stores for its quick deliveries — a contrast to rivals like Swiggy, Zomato-owned Blinkit, and Zepto, which rely on dark stores. The shift did not help Pincode gain ground in the crowded segment, prompting PhonePe to wind down the service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pincode was not PhonePe’s first move into e-commerce. In 2019, the company <a href=\"https://www.phonepe.com/press/launching-phonepe-switch-your-shortcut-to-a-world-of-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched “Switch,”</a> a super-app layer inside its payments app that offered access to food, grocery, shopping, and travel services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe has now shut down the Pincode app and <a href=\"https://www.pincode.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">redirected its website</a> to PhonePe’s main site. The company said it will now focus on working with offline retailers by expanding its B2B offerings. In July, PhonePe said it had digitized over 1,000 local stores across Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Varanasi through Pincode, giving them access to digital storefronts, inventory tools, and last-mile delivery services.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As part of this strategic decision, we will now focus the entire Pincode team’s resources towards accelerating the build-out and scale-up of a suite of B2B business solutions for offline businesses across India,” Vivek Lohcheb, CEO of Pincode, said in a prepared statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PhonePe already offers inventory and order-management tools, as well as other ERP software for small businesses, and provides direct sourcing and replenishment services in some categories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift comes as PhonePe prepares for a public listing in India, nearly three years after its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/flipkart-and-phonepe-complete-separation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spin-off from Flipkart</a>.

The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://archive.ph/o/scFDT/https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/04/30/chicago-tribune-sues-openai-microsoft/\">that sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material in April.

Another nine from these publishers <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/28/openai-microsoft-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sued</a> the model maker and its cloud provider in November, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While creators have filed <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/copyright/article/98961-authors-class-action-lawsuit-against-openai-moves-forward.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many lawsuits</a> against model makers over using their work for model training, we’ll have to see if the courts weigh in about the legal liabilities of RAG as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity did not immediately respond to the Chicago Tribune’s story about its own lawsuit, nor to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Perplexity is facing other such suits.

And the singular message, amid a deluge of product news and keynotes, was AI for the enterprise. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year it was all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels capped off the final night with a keynote aimed at lifting up developers and assuaging any fears that AI is coming for engineering jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-reinvent-2025-how-to-watch-and-follow-along-live/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AWS re:Invent 2025</a>, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. <br><br>“We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent. Be sure to check back.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-werner-out\">Werner out …</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon CTO Werner Vogels had the closing keynote of the conference — and it looks like this will be his last one. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is my final re:Invent keynote,” he said, then quickly added he is not leaving the company. “I’m not leaving Amazon or anything like that, but I think that after 14 re:Invents you guys are owed young, fresh, new voices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vogels then spent more than an hour talking to a packed room before ending with a “Werner, out” and a literal mic drop. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-will-ai-take-your-job\">Will AI take your job? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vogels spent much of the closing keynote talking about AI and its role in the future, including the looming threat that it will take away jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Will AI take my job? Maybe,” Vogels asked and answered, before noting that some tasks will be automated, and some skills will become obsolete. “So maybe we should rephrase and reframe this question. Will AI make me obsolete? Absolutely not, if you evolve.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-next-gen-cpu\">Next-gen CPU</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-graviton-5-cpu-amazon-ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unveiled</a> its Graviton5 CPU on Thursday, the next-generation chip that the company promises will be its highest performing, most efficient yet. The Graviton5 contains 192 processor cores, a dense and efficient design that AWS says reduces the distance data must travel between cores. That helps cut inter-core communication latency by up to 33% while increasing bandwidth, the company said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-doubling-down-on-llms\">Doubling down on LLMs</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced more tools for enterprise customers to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/aws-doubles-down-on-custom-llms-with-features-meant-to-simplify-model-creation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create their own models</a>. Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier. <br><br>For instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure. The serverless model customization can be accessed through either a self-guided path or by prompting an AI agent.<br><br>AWS also announced Reinforcement Fine Tuning in Bedrock, which allows developers to choose a preset workflow or reward system and have Bedrock run their customization process automatically from start to finish.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-andy-jassy-shares-some-numbers\">Andy Jassy shares some numbers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took to social media platform X to expound on AWS chief Matt Garman’s keynote speech. The message: The current generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip Trainium2 is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/andy-jassy-says-amazons-nvidia-competitor-chip-is-already-a-multi-billion-dollar-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">already bringing in loads of cash</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His comments were tied to the reveal of its next-generation chip, Trainium3, and meant to forecast a promising revenue future for the product.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-database-savings-arrives\">Database savings arrives</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tucked among the dozens of announcements is one item that is already getting cheers: Discounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Specifically, AWS said it was launching Database Savings Plans, which help customers reduce database costs by up to 35% when they commit to a consistent amount of usage ($/hour) over a one-year term. The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.duckbillhq.com/blog/aws-database-savings-plans-six-years-of-complaining-finally-pays-off/\">in his blog post</a>, “Six years of complaining finally pays off.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-t-get-a-better-deal-than-free-amazon-hopes\">Can’t get a better deal than free, Amazon hopes  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Is there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year’s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/amazon-hopes-to-jump-start-its-ai-coding-tool-kiro-by-giving-it-away-to-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+</a> to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-training-chip-and-nvidia-compatibility\">An AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS introduced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new version of its AI training chip</a> called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expanded-agentcore-capabilities\">Expanded AgentCore capabilities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-announces-new-capabilities-for-its-ai-agent-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform</a>. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-nonstop-ai-agent-worker-bee\">A nonstop AI agent worker bee</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-nova-models-and-services\">New Nova models and services</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is rolling out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-launches-new-nova-ai-models-and-a-service-that-gives-customers-more-control/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">four new AI models</a> within its Nova AI model family — three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS’s big pitch is flexibility and customization.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lyft-s-argument-for-ai-agents\">Lyft’s argument for AI agents</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/aws-and-lyft-bringing-agentic-ai-to-life-for-riders-and-drivers\">piped up during the event</a> to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-factory-for-the-private-data-center\">An AI Factory for the private data center</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced “AI Factories”</a> that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube wp-block-html\" id=\"youtube-iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PwnFQypXuY?si=VstFHIC-23XfS2y2&amp;autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has said the bus was partially blocking the driveway and that the robotaxi could not see the flashing lights or stop sign. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo also said it issued a software update to its fleet to improve performance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reports of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing school buses has continued even after the fix. The Austin School District has reported 19 different instances of Waymo automated vehicles illegally passing school buses since the beginning of the 2025-26 school year. The school district <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INOT-PE25013-30888P1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">noted in a letter</a> to Waymo that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software on November 17.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an emailed statement, Waymo said safety is its top priority. The company also said data shows its robotaxis are improving road safety, noting a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and 12x fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have already made software updates to improve our performance and are committed to continuous improvement,” the statement continued. “NHTSA plays a vital role in road safety, and we will continue to work collaboratively with the agency as part of our mission to be the world’s most trusted driver.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo contends that the software updates have meaningfully improved performance to a level better than human drivers in this area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Austin School District seems to disagree and has asked Waymo to cease operations during certain times of the day when students are arriving and departing school.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Waymo’s software updates are clearly not working as intended nor as quickly as required,” the district’s November 20 letter to Waymo reads. “We cannot allow Waymo to continue endangering our students while it attempts to implement a fix. Accordingly, Austin ISD demands that Waymo immediately cease operation of its automated vehicles during the hours of 5:20 a.m. – 9:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m., until more in-depth software updates are completed and Waymo can guarantee its vehicles will comply with the law.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Federal regulators with the Office of Defects Investigation <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INOT-PE25013-30887.pdf\">sent Waymo a letter</a> four days later noting that it had been alerted by Austin school district officials.

The three-year-old startup, which helps AI labs recruit and manage human experts for training data, started the year with roughly $7 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, it claims to have surpassed $100 million in ARR, founder and CEO Ali Ansari told TechCrunch. That figure is also more than double the revenue Micro1 reported in September when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/micro1-a-competitor-to-scale-ai-raises-funds-at-500m-valuation/\">announced its $35 million Series A</a> at a $500 million valuation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ansari, 24, said then that Micro1 works with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as Fortune 100 companies racing to improve large language models through post-training and reinforcement learning. Their demand for top-tier human data has fueled a fast-expanding market that Ansari believes will grow from $10-15 billion today to nearly $100 billion within two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Micro1’s rise, and that of larger competitors such as Mercor and Surge, accelerated after OpenAI and Google DeepMind <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/18/openai-is-winding-down-its-work-with-scale-ai-founder-is-joining-meta.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly cut ties with Scale AI</a> following Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/scale-ai-confirms-significant-investment-from-meta-says-ceo-alexandr-wang-is-leaving/\">$14 billion investment</a> in the vendor and its decision to hire Scale’s CEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Micro1’s ARR is growing fast, according to the founder, it hasn’t yet matched its rivals: Mercor’s more than $450 million, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/sources-ai-training-startup-mercor-eyes-10b-valuation-on-450m-run-rate/\">sources told TechCrunch,</a> and Surge’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/forbes-magazine_surge-ai-which-helps-tech-companies-get-activity-7374140116036141056-H_gZ/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported </a>$1.2 billion in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ansari attributes Micro1’s growth to its ability to recruit and evaluate domain experts quickly. Like Mercor, Micro1 began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting into the data-training market. That tool now interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond supplying expert-level data to leading AI labs, Ansari says two new segments, still barely visible today, are on track to reshape the economics of human data.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first involves non-AI-native Fortune 1000 enterprises that will begin building AI agents for internal workflows, support operations, finance, and industry-specific tasks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developing these agents requires systematic evaluation: testing frontier models, grading their output, choosing winners, fine-tuning them, and continuously validating performance in production. Ansari argues this cycle depends heavily on human experts evaluating AI behavior at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second is robotics pre-training, which requires high-quality, human-generated demonstrations of everyday physical tasks. Micro1 is already building what Ansari calls the world’s largest robotics pre-training dataset, collecting demonstrations from hundreds of generalists recording object interactions in their homes. Robotics companies will need vast volumes of this data before their systems can reliably operate in homes and offices, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We anticipate that a good portion of the product budgets at non-AI-native enterprises will go towards evals and human data, moving from 0% to at least 25% of product budgets,” said the CEO, who founded Micro1 while at UC Berkeley. “We’re also helping robotics labs create robotics data; these two areas will account for a massive share of that $100 billion-a-year market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even as new markets emerge, Micro1’s current growth still comes primarily from elite AI labs and AI-heavy enterprises. The startup is scaling its work with these labs on reinforcement learning, the feedback loop  to test and improve model behavior.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Micro1 hopes its early move into robotics data and enterprise agent development, in addition to scaling its specialized RL environments, will help it capture additional market share as the data wars intensify.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Ansari says the company is focused on scaling responsibly, paying experts well, and keeping people at the center of an industry built on training machines. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company currently manages thousands of experts across hundreds of domains, ranging from highly technical fields to surprisingly offline disciplines. Many earn close to $100 an hour, according to Ansari.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs spending half their week training AI through Micro1,” Ansari said. “But the bigger shift is in the sheer volume and range of roles. It’s expanding into areas you wouldn’t expect to matter for language model training, including offline and less technical fields. We’re very optimistic about where this is heading.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Before that, she served as the legal adviser of the U.S. Department of State, where she led the team advising the secretary of state on legal issues affecting the conduct of U.S. foreign relations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She also held other government positions in the past, including as general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, as a principal deputy assistant attorney general of the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice, as associate White House counsel, and as a law clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Newstead will oversee both the Legal and Government Affairs organizations, noted Cook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We couldn’t be more pleased to have Jennifer join our team,” he said. “She brings an extraordinary depth of experience and skill to the role, and will advance Apple’s important work all over the world.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During Adams’ time at Apple, the company faced increased antitrust regulation and lawsuits, largely focused on increasing competition in the app market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Jackson, who had previously been appointed to the EPA before joining Apple in 2013, was involved with Apple’s climate initiatives, sustainability efforts, environmental impact, and DEI-focused endeavors, like its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/apple-commits-100m-to-its-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</a>. Such efforts have fallen out of favor at corporate giants under the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I am deeply appreciative of Lisa’s contributions. She has been instrumental in helping us reduce our global greenhouse emissions by more than 60 percent compared to 2015 levels,” said Cook in a statement. “She has also been a critical strategic partner in engaging governments around the world, advocating for the best interests of our users on a myriad of topics, as well as advancing our values, from education and accessibility to privacy and security.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple has seen a number of changes in leadership in recent months, having also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/apple-coo-jeff-williams-to-step-down-later-this-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced the departure of chief operating officer Jeff Williams in July</a>, with duties shifting to Sabih Khan, who had previously served as the senior vice president of operations. Before Giannandrea’s exit, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/apple-puts-vision-pro-exec-in-charge-of-siri-in-exec-shakeup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple had replaced him</a> as head of the Siri team with Mike Rockwell, who had been VP of the Vision Products Group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/apple-loses-another-ai-exec-to-meta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">also lost Ke Yang</a>, the executive leading Apple’s work on AI-driven web search, to Meta; and it saw the departure of Ruoming Pang, Apple’s former head of AI models, who left for Meta <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-07/apple-loses-its-top-ai-models-executive-to-meta-s-hiring-spree?srnd=phx-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earlier this year</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The leadership changes as Apple has fallen behind in the AI race, pushing back the launch of an AI-powered Siri, which will now run Google’s models under the hood. Apple has also been criticized by designers for losing its sharp attention to detail that the company has long been known for. This reportedly led to some celebration of Dye’s departure among Apple employees, per a <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/bad_dye_job\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report from Daring Fireball</a>, who are glad that a career interface and interaction designer, Stephen Lemay, has taken over the role.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This was in addition to throwing shade on one particular unnamed competitor, which was clearly OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amodei declined to give a simple yes-or-no answer to the question of a bubble, saying it was a complex situation, but instead explained his thoughts about the economics of AI in more detail.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He described himself as bullish on the potential of the technology, but cautioned that there could be players in the ecosystem who might make a “timing error” or could see “bad things” happen when it comes to the economic payoffs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s an inherent risk when the timing of the economic value is uncertain,” Amodei explained. He said companies had to take risks to compete with each other and authoritarian adversaries — a reference to the threat from China — but added that some players were not “managing that risk well, who are taking unwise risks.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue, he said, is the uncertainty around how quickly the economic value of AI will grow and properly mapping that to the lag times on building more data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s [a] genuine dilemma, which we as a company try to manage as responsibly as we can,” Amodei said. “And then I think there are some players who are ‘YOLO-ing,’ who pull the risk dial too far, and I’m very concerned,” he added, using the slang term for “you only live once,” which is often used to justify risk-taking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, he spoke to the question around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/27/this-thanksgivings-real-drama-may-be-michael-burry-versus-nvidia/\">AI chips’ deprecation timelines</a>. That’s another hot-button topic and a factor that could negatively impact the industry’s economics if GPUs become obsolete and lose their value ahead of schedule.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The issue isn’t the lifetime of the chips — chips keep working for a long time. The issue is new chips come out that are faster and cheaper…and so the value of old chips can go down somewhat,” Amodei said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said Anthropic was making conservative assumptions on this front and others as it planned for an uncertain future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI company’s revenue has grown 10x per year over the past three years, the CEO said, going from zero to $100 million in 2023, then $100 million to $1 billion in 2024, and will land somewhere between $8-10 billion by the end of this year. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Amodei said he would be “really dumb” to just assume that the pattern would continue. “I don’t know if a year from now, if it’s going to be 20 billion or if it’s going to be 50…it’s very uncertain. I try to plan conservatively. So I plan for the lower side of it, but that is very disconcerting,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI companies like his have to plan how much compute they’ll need in the years ahead, and how much they should invest in data centers. If they don’t buy enough, they may not be able to serve their customers. And if they buy too much, they’ll struggle to keep up with costs or, in the worst-case scenario, they could go bankrupt. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, OpenAI landed in a PR crises when its CFO said she <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/06/sam-altman-says-he-doesnt-want-the-government-to-bail-out-openai-if-it-fails/\">wanted the U.S. government to “backstop” her company’s infrastructure loans</a>, aka insure them so taxpayers would pick of the bill if OpenAI could not. After the furor, she walked back the comments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those who take more risks could overextend themselves, Amodei warned, especially if “you’re a person who just kind of, like constitutionally, just wants to ‘YOLO’ things, or just likes big numbers,” he said, in a veiled reference to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think we’re going to be okay in, basically, almost all worlds…I can’t speak for other companies,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Tesla CEO <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1996631421449072754\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> the update allows it “depending on context of surrounding traffic.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk didn’t offer any details, and Tesla does not have a PR team that can provide more information. Musk didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nearly all 50 states have banned texting while driving, and around half of states have made any handheld phone usage while driving illegal, <a href=\"https://www.bts.gov/content/state-laws-distracted-driving-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite Musk’s perpetual hype, FSD is still a driver-assistance system that does not make Tesla’s vehicles fully autonomous. Drivers initially needed to have their hands on the wheel even when FSD was engaged. That requirement was later removed and allowed drivers to have hands off as long as the in-cabin camera detected they were paying attention to the road. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FSD uses a mix of in-cabin camera and steering wheel sensors to monitor a driver’s attentiveness. And because FSD is just driver-assistance software, and not full autonomy, drivers need to be ready to take control of the vehicle if the system encounters a situation it cannot handle. This handover of control is often a major component of crashes that involve the use of driver-assistance systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk himself <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17313324/tesla-autopilot-safety-statistics-elon-musk-q1-earnings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has in the past said</a> that Autopilot, the driver-assistance system that comes standard in all Teslas, sometimes made drivers too complacent and confident.

Their credibility — rooted in Kyle’s career with the Minnesota Vikings, co-founder Jason Zucker’s career with the Buffalo Sabres, Jon’s operator background, and the early crowdfunding success that inspired their model — forms a powerful foundation of founder-market fit that’s hard to copy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their pivot from exclusive $10,000 golf events to accessible $10 sweepstakes demonstrates how democratizing access can actually elevate prestige when done with intention. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while not every founder begins with celebrity reach, every founder <em>does</em> begin with a network and the ability to grow influence. The real differentiator is how you activate it: strategically, authentically, and in ways that create clear value. Thought leadership is one of the most effective levers: sharing insights publicly; showing up on social media with purpose; writing, speaking, and consistently putting your ideas into the world. That’s how you become a “celebrity” in your own right, through credibility and contribution. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This episode isn’t about chasing fame.

The startup raised $160 million in the round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This latest capital infusion came just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/four-months-after-a-3b-valuation-harvey-ai-grows-to-5b/\">months after it raised $300 million in a Series E</a> round at a $5 billion valuation in June. And that was just months after raising a Sequoia-led <a href=\"https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harvey-raises-series-d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$300 million Series D</a> at a $3 billion valuation in February.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harvey’s investors include EQT, WndrCo, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Sarah Guo’s Conviction, and Elad Gil. In September, just before raising this latest mega round, Harvey <a href=\"https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harveys-momentum-in-q3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> some details about its business. While it declined to share any absolute numbers, just percentages of growth and retention (it later told TechCrunch that it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue back in August), it said that it counts 50 of the top AmLaw 100 firms as its customers. It also serves corporate legal teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an industry entirely based on words, it makes sense that legal functions would be a perfect use case for LLMs: searching, summarizing, and drafting, all based on domain-specific training. But Harvey is also one of the best examples of how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/vcs-deploy-kingmaking-strategy-to-crown-ai-winners-in-their-infancy/\">VCs are “kingmaking” these days</a>. That involves pouring vast sums of money into a startup to signal how solid it is, which encourages large enterprise customers, like law firms, to sign big contracts in a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that Harvey was founded in 2022, it may be far enough ahead of competitors — both in customer acquisition and the reinforced training from working with so many law firms — that it is the king of this market. At least, one of its long-time VCs, Elad Gil, thinks so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gil told TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/elad-gil-on-which-ai-markets-have-winners-and-which-are-still-wide-open/\">that Harvey is one of the AI market leaders</a> that is experiencing bona fide growth because its tech and market position are “just working.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harvey’s founder and CEO Winston Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/14/inside-harvey-how-a-first-year-legal-associate-built-one-of-silicon-valleys-hottest-startups/\">an incredible story of how it originally</a> claimed the hearts of Silicon Valley’s powerhouse VCs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It all started with a proof of concept about landlord-tenant law and a cold email to Sam Altman.

(Amnesty published screenshots taken from the video, but not the full video.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The nonprofit researchers wrote that the leaked video shows apparent “live” Predator infection attempts “against real targets,” based on detailed information “from at least one infection attempt against a target in Kazakhstan.” The video contained the infection URL, the target’s IP address, and the software versions of the target’s phone.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3072893\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=430,196 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=720,328 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=668,304 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=708,322 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/predator-target-dashboard.jpeg?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A screenshot of the dashboard of an Intellexa customer surveillance system, which shows the types of sensitive personal data of hacked targets that customers and Intellexa support staff may have access to. </span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amnesty International</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies that sell spyware to government agencies, such as NSO Group and the now-defunct Hacking Team, have long maintained that they never have access to the data of their customers’ targets, nor their customers’ systems. There are several reasons why. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From the point of view of the spyware makers, they don’t want the potential legal liability if their customers use the spyware unlawfully. And spyware makers would rather say that once they sell their spyware, the customers are fully responsible for using it. From the government customers’ standpoint, they don’t want to expose details of their sensitive investigations, such as targets’ names, locations, and personal data, to a private company that may be based overseas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, this type of remote access is absolutely not “normal,” as Paolo Lezzi, the chief executive of spyware maker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/ceo-of-spyware-maker-memento-labs-confirms-one-of-its-government-customers-was-caught-using-its-malware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Memento Labs</a>, told TechCrunch when contacted for this story to ask from the perspective of a spyware maker. “No [government] agency would accept it,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why Lezzi was skeptical that the leaked training video was showing access to an actual customer’s live surveillance system. Perhaps, he posited, this was training material showing a demo environment. The chief executive also said that some customers have asked Memento Labs to have access to their systems, but the company only accepts the offer if it’s necessary to solve technical issues. In any case, he said, “they enable us to have TeamViewer access for the necessary time and under their supervision we carry out the intervention and leave.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Intellexa?

Not only is their most sensitive data exposed to a government or other spyware customer, but their data risks being exposed to a foreign surveillance company, which has demonstrable issues in keeping their confidential data stored securely,” the nonprofit wrote in the report. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intellexa could not be reached for comment. A lawyer speaking on behalf of Intellexa’s founder, Tal Dilian, told Haaretz that Dilian has “not committed any crime nor operated any cyber system in Greece or anywhere else.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dilian is one of the more controversial people in the world of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#spyware-commercial-government\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">government spyware</a>. A veteran of the spyware industry previously told TechCrunch that Dilian “moves like an elephant in a crystal shop,” implying he made little effort to conceal his activities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In that particular space of spyware sellers you have to be extremely balanced and attentive … but he didn’t care,” said the person.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/us-sanctions-founder-of-spyware-maker-intellexa-for-targeting-americans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. government announced sanctions against Tal Dilian</a> and one of his business partner, Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou. In that case, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions based on allegations that Intellexa’s spyware was used against Americans, including U.S. government officials, journalists, and policy experts. The sanctions make it illegal for American companies and nationals to have any commercial relationship with Dilian and Hamou.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was the first time the U.S. government, which has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">taken actions against spyware developer NSO Group</a>, targeted a specific person involved in the industry.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his response to Haaretz, Dilian accused journalists of being “useful idiots” in an “orchestrated campaign” to hurt him and his company, which was “fed into the Biden administration.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Next year, users will be able to send their notes and documents to Alexa+ and have a more involved conversation about them.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3052266\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg 1206w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download_f74296.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kindle</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the Colorsoft allows artists to create smooth gradients and subtle tones with a new shader tool.

And while robotaxis have become commonplace in the San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Los Angeles, autonomous trucks are absent because regulations ban any driverless vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds from testing on public roads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agency, which has considered lifting the ban for a couple of years now, released a draft of the proposed changes in 2024. The final proposed revisions were released Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revised regulations cover a few areas beyond self-driving trucks, including language that appears to give law enforcement the power to issue traffic tickets to driverless vehicles — an issue that has received more attention as Waymo has expanded its commercial robotaxi operation in the state. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The self-driving trucks component is by far the most contentious. The revisions reflect feedback received during the initial public comment period this spring, the agency said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proposal was met with enthusiasm by companies developing autonomous vehicle technology, many of which are based in California, but test on highways in other states like Texas. Companies like Aurora Innovation and Kodiak AI eventually want to use <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/aurora-expands-self-driving-trucks-route-to-el-paso/\">self-driving trucks to carry freight</a> along commerce-heavy freeways across states. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The California DMV’s latest draft regulations show real progress toward creating a regulatory framework for driverless trucks in the state and unlocking coast-to-coast autonomous operations,” Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, said in an emailed statement. “These proposed regulations are a critical step towards bringing autonomous trucks to California freeways in 2026, a milestone that will enhance road safety and grow the economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Teamsters Union, which has fought to protect truck drivers, is unmoved. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our position remains the same, we are opposed to the deployment and testing of this technology on our roads,” Shane Gusman, the legislative director for Teamsters California, told TechCrunch. “The changes that are made don’t change our position.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gusman noted that the Teamsters will fight the proposed revisions. It’s also lobbying for <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">passage of AB 33</a>, a bill currently on the state Senate floor, which would require a human safety operator behind the wheel of any heavy duty autonomous truck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV’s revised rules would require self-driving truck companies to go through a phased permitting process, mirroring current regulations applied to light-duty autonomous vehicles like robotaxis. Companies would first receive a permit to test with a human safety operator behind the wheel. The DMV issues separate permits for driverless testing and deployment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Manufacturers would be required to conduct testing for a minimum number of miles prior to applying for a driverless testing permit and a deployment permit, under the DMV rules. For instance, self-driving truck companies would need to complete a minimum of 500,000 autonomous test miles — 100,000 of which must occur in the intended operational design domain in California — before it will receive a driverless permit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV also proposed revising rules that would affect light-duty autonomous vehicles. For instance, the regulations would expand the frequency and type of data reported to the department during testing and deployment and require companies to update plans on interacting with first responders on a more regular basis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before she was a VC, Masha Bucher worked in PR and marketing — an experience that has shaped the way she runs Day One Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After years of working in communications — including executive roles that gave her deep insight into how startups operate — Bucher realized she could either use her business acumen to become one of the most effective PR reps in the game, or evolve into something more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was seeing what was going on in business, and because I could understand the context, I understood business, and because I understood business, my PR pitches would be very business focused,” Bucher told TechCrunch on today’s episode of Equity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She founded Day One Ventures in 2018 after realizing she could create more impact — and make better returns — by investing in startups and providing them with integrated PR support. By combining these two functions, she could help portfolio companies more meaningfully while backing only the stories she truly believed in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The structure of PR services is very misaligned,” Bucher said, noting that PR firms working on a contract basis often lean toward working slower so they can stretch out client payments. “For startups, it’s really important to move fast.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond speed, there’s a cost barrier: “Early-stage companies shouldn’t be paying $10, $20, or $30 grand per month for six months to get one announcement in TechCrunch. I just don’t think that’s fair, and I don’t think it’s sustainable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Day One’s integrated model allows Bucher to work with startups at critical early stages when they need support most. Younger startups might pivot or experience founder shake-ups, and “you need to be trusted to advise and help them make decisions.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backing a company financially gives her something many traditional PR firms can’t offer: She’s literally invested in the story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have an ambition to be, ideally, the first investor in the most important and ambitious ideas and companies of our time,” Bucher said. “I think that starts with you understanding the field, understanding the business, getting a conviction on the business. And once you have this conviction — which you’ve proved by investing in the company — you have the right to introduce it to reporters with much higher integrity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Someone in PR who gets access to everything from investor decks to a startup’s data room has serious advantages in positioning the company and understanding what’s at stake. And for Bucher, it makes the work more compelling. Doing PR for whatever companies are big enough to pay might be good business, “but that doesn’t mean it’s a good story.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with any VC, Bucher answers to her investors — in Day One’s case, that’s more than 70 LPs, including institutions, individuals, and more than 15 of the firm’s own portfolio founders. That means her bets need to be carefully considered. When Bucher chooses companies, she’s not only asking whether she wants to see their vision become reality, but whether the founder has the ethics and moral compass to maintain their values as the company scales. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She points to Valar Atomics, a startup developing advance nuclear reactors, as an example. Day One <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/10/nuclear-startup-valar-atomics-raises-130-million.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">co-led a $130 million round</a> into the startup last month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I can’t think of a better founder,” she said, referring to Valar’s CEO Isaiah Taylor, noting she trusts him with “literally life-and-death” decisions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That moral filter means there are companies she wouldn’t back, even if they’re getting hype. Bucher said she wasn’t swayed by AI startup Cluely’s rage-bait “cheat on everything” marketing strategy. Rather, she’s proud to have invested in some of the most innovative technologies in areas like reproductive tech (<a href=\"https://www.orchidhealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Orchid’s</a> embryo selection technology), accessible healthcare (<a href=\"https://superpower.com/?srsltid=AfmBOook08N1SgXG4iVTDvxlWKNNMJcRxLx4dMEiu8WjpSoSWpDSEmim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Superpower</a>), and law-enforcement software (<a href=\"https://abelpolice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Abel’s</a> AI-optimized report-writing tools).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Day One’s portfolio includes early bets on companies like Sam Altman’s World, the email app Superhuman, and the remote work platform Remote.com, with at least 12 unicorns under its belt and $115 billion-plus in portfolio value. Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/vc-queen-masha-bucher-largest-fund-150m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Day One closed its Fund III with $150 million</a>, targeting early-stage founders “solving humanity’s most pressing issues,” and has grown over the last six years from $11 million in assets under management to well over $450 million today, says Bucher.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to use comms to solve companies’ business goals, unlock new opportunities, and to help them, ultimately, to grow shareholder value,” Bucher said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Plus, the system sends out improved SMS and email alerts about risky activity and will recognize users’ devices better than before, Meta promises. And it will connect users with other tools to secure their account, like running a security checkup, setting up two-factor authentication, or adding a passkey.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3072780\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=768,669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=680,592 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=1200,1045 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=1280,1115 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=430,374 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=720,627 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=900,784 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=800,697 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=1536,1338 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=668,582 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=431,375 431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=709,617 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=610,531 610w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Security-Checkup_Carousel-02.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Account recovery methods now also offer the option to take <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/NcgECk6xoxIrNNJDu9soFG9y1q?domain=meta.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an optional selfie video</a> to verify your identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta claims the new hub will make things easier on its users, simply the act of moving around where settings and help are found can lead to confusion.

The two sides have spent months negotiating what the next version of the contract would look like, but those negotiations have been complicated by President Trump’s push to privatize the USPS, the Post reports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the current agreement, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency’s revenue in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The USPS is a longstanding and trusted partner and we remain committed to working together,” Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in a statement, adding that the company is discussing “ways to extend our partnership.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Kelly said Amazon was “surprised to hear” the USPS wants to “run an auction” for some of its shipping capacity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[S]o we still have a lot to work through. Given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we’re evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon already operates a large transportation network that includes airplanes, Rivian electric vans, and a budding drone delivery service — though the drone program has faced a number of struggles this year, including most recently, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/25/amazon-faa-probe-delivery-drone-incident-texas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Federal Aviation Administration probe</a>.
