In late December and January, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/grok-x-ai-elon-musk-deepfakes.html\">Grok was used to create at least 1.8 million sexualized images of women</a>, according to separate analyses by The New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.komdigi.go.id/berita/siaran-pers/detail/kemkomdigi-awasi-ketat-normalisasi-grok-usai-x-sampaikan-komitmen-kepatuhan\">a statement</a>, Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs said that it was lifting the ban after X sent a letter “outlining concrete steps for service improvements and the prevention of misuse” (translation <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/indonesia-lift-grok-ban.html\">via The New York Times</a>). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space monitoring, said the ban is only being lifted “conditionally” and could be reinstated if “further violations are discovered.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Malaysia and the Philippines lifted their bans on January 23.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grok’s deepfakes have spurred criticism and investigations — but only a few outright bans — from governments around the world. In the United States, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office was<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/california-ag-sends-musks-xai-a-cease-and-desist-order-over-sexual-deepfakes/\"> investigating xAI and had sent a cease-and-desist letter</a> ordering the company to take immediate action to end the production of these images.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI appears to have taken some steps to restrict Grok’s capabilities, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/x-restricts-groks-image-generation-to-paying-subscribers-only-after-drawing-the-worlds-ire/\">limiting its AI image generation feature to paying subscribers on X</a>. CEO <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/indonesia-lift-grok-ban.html\">Elon Musk has insisted</a>, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content” and said he is “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\">not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.</a>”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Documents released by the Justice Department on Friday around the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein include <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/expressed-interest-visiting-jeffrey-epstein-island-emails-show-doj-rcna256784\">at least 16 emails between Musk and Epstein</a> in 2012 and 2013, with Musk asking to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island and wondering about the “wildest party on your island.” Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution in 2008.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI, meanwhile, is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">reportedly in talks to merge with two of Musk’s other companies</a>, SpaceX and Tesla, ahead of a SpaceX IPO.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

When Tesla acquired Solar City in 2016, he (and his comms team) pitched it as a sustainable energy company. Over the past year, he has pushed the idea of Tesla as an AI and robotics company. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s aspirational branding has slammed right up against financial reality: The bulk of its revenue comes from selling EVs. Its latest earnings support this. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company generated $94.8 billion in revenue in 2025. Of that, $69.5 billion came from selling and leasing EVs as well as related regulatory credits. The remaining $25 billion is split nearly down the middle between its energy generation (solar) and storage business and “services and other,” which include revenue from its Superchargers, parts sales, and Full Self-Driving subscriptions. That reliance on deliveries means that as EV sales have dipped, so has Tesla’s entire balance sheet. Its profits in 2025 were <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\">46% lower</a> year-over-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has tried to grow its non-EV businesses to compensate for the decline in sales, and its Q4 and full-year earnings report (and its accompanying call) signaled a shift beyond the persistent AI-robotics talk and toward action. For now, that action involves spending money, not making it. Musk repeatedly stressed that 2026 would be a huge CapEx year, more than doubling spending <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-plans-20-billion-capital-spending-spree-push-beyond-human-driven-cars-2026-01-29/\">to $20 billion</a>, which would put them in negative-cash-flow territory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Musk announced that Tesla is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-is-killing-off-the-model-s-and-model-x/\">ending production of the Model S and Model X</a>, which is more symbolic than material. Those two models represent about 2% of Tesla’s sales volume, a point that Barclays analyst Dan Levy also makes in his most recent note. Still, it is a notable end-of-an-era moment for Tesla and the broader automotive industry, which was forever changed when the Model S went on sale in 2012. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more material move is what Tesla plans to do now. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla plans to fill the production void left by the Model S and X with its Optimus humanoid robots, which will be made at its Fremont, California, factory. Musk also intends to scale Tesla’s robotaxi operations to more cities in 2026 and even floated the need for Tesla to build a TerraFab factory to shore up chip supply. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the item that really stood out to me — and a true Elon Inc circular economy deal — was Tesla’s plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-invested-2b-in-elon-musks-xai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invest $2 billion</a> into another Musk company, xAI, and signaled plans to more closely align those two companies. Meanwhile, other outlets are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reporting</a> talks are underway to possibly merge (in some combination) three of Musk’s companies: SpaceX, Tesla, and xAI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But let’s come back down to earth for a moment and review Tesla’s current business. Its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-earnings-profit-q4-2025/\">sales are down</a> year-over-year, while its smaller energy storage business <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/teslas-energy-storage-business-is-growing-faster-than-any-other-part-of-the-company/\">made positive gains</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re not quite ready to share the full details, but we’ve heard from one little bird that there is some activity on the fundraising front for Waymo.

The autonomous vehicle startup has <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/waabi-raises-1b-and-expands-into-robotaxis-with-uber/\">raised $750 million</a> in a Series C round co-led by <strong>Khosla Ventures</strong> and <strong>G2 Venture Partners</strong>, plus another $250 million in milestone capital from <strong>Uber</strong> to support the deployment of 25,000 or more Waabi Driver-powered robotaxis exclusively on its platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber is already a Waabi backer, participating in one of its earliest raises in 2021. But this is about more than money. When Waabi first launched, it focused on applying its autonomous vehicle tech to self-driving trucks. The deal with Uber is a declaration that it intends to scale its tech across multiple self-driving verticals with a single technology stack. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Can Waabi do it? Others have tried and retreated. <strong>Waymo</strong> shuttered its self-driving trucks program to focus on robotaxis; <strong>Aurora</strong>, which is also an<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ai-pioneer-raquel-urtasun-launches-self-driving-vehicle-startup-with-backing-from-khosla-uber-and-aurora/\"> investor in Waabi</a>, was working on both trucks and robotaxis, too, before deciding to focus just on big rigs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Gatik AI</strong>, a startup developing autonomous trucks focused on the “middle mile,” has signed a deal with a major (unnamed) consumer-goods company. Here’s why it matters: The contract will deliver <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://gatik.ai/news/press-releases/gatik-becomes-first-us-company-to-operate-fully-driverless-trucks-at-scale-for-commercial-deliveries/\">$600 million in revenue</a> over five years. And these are for driverless transport, meaning no safety driver is behind the wheel. These Gatik trucks, which run 24 hours a day moving ambient, refrigerated, and frozen goods between distribution centers and stores, have been operating driverlessly since mid-2025. According to the company, it has completed 60,000 fully driverless orders without incident. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Luminar’s</strong> lidar business has been sold for $33 million to Redmond, Washington-based <strong>MicroVision</strong>. The company, which is developing its own sensors, beat out Quantum Computing in an auction for the assets. TC’s Sean O’Kane <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/luminar-receives-a-larger-33-million-bid-for-its-lidar-business/\">interviewed</a> MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos about his plans for Luminar. The sales process did have a bit of last-minute intrigue when a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/luminar-sale-approved-despite-last-minute-mystery-bid/\">mystery bidder</a>, with a far larger offer, made a play for Luminar’s lidar business.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>, which started the bankruptcy process about a month ago, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/rad-power-bikes-reaches-deal-to-sell-itself-for-13-2-million/\">reached a deal</a> to sell itself to Life Electric Vehicles Holdings (or Life EV) for around $13.2 million. When accounting for Rad Power’s liabilities, the total value of the bid is $14.9 million. History lesson: Rad Power has raised $329.2 million since its founding and once had a valuation of $1.65 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Redwood Materials</strong> raised $425 million in a Series E round that includes Google as a new investor. The round was led by venture firm Eclipse and includes a strategic investment by Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures, as well as existing investors Capricorn and Goldman Sachs. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/redwood-attracts-google-for-its-425m-series-e-as-ai-power-needs-rise/\">Read the full story</a> to learn what Redwood plans to do with the capital. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-notable-reads-and-other-tidbits\">Notable reads and other tidbits</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1926823\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,193 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,171 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=430,108 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=720,181 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=900,226 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=800,201 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=668,168 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=708,178 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Obi</strong>, a company that aggregates real-time pricing and pickup times across multiple ride-hailing services, shared new data on ride-hailing and robotaxis in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The country offers a large pool of engineering talent and growing demand for cloud services, and has positioned itself as a key alternative to the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia for expanding compute infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October, Google said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invest $15 billion</a> to build an AI hub and expand data-center infrastructure in India, its largest commitment in the country to date, following a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$10 billion commitment</a> in 2020. Microsoft followed in December with plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-to-invest-17-5b-in-india-by-2029-as-ai-race-accelerates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invest $17.5 billion</a> by 2029 to expand its AI and cloud footprint, funding new data centers, infrastructure, and training programs. Amazon has also stepped up its spending in December, saying it would invest an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/amazon-to-invest-additional-35b-in-india-by-2030-taking-total-planned-spending-to-75b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">additional $35 billion</a> in India by 2030, taking its total planned commitment to about $75 billion as it expands its retail and cloud operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s domestic data-center sector is also ramping up to meet global demand. In November, Digital Connexion, a joint venture backed by Reliance Industries, Brookfield Asset Management, and Digital Realty Trust, said it would <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-27/reliance-venture-to-build-11-billion-ai-data-center-in-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invest $11 billion</a> by 2030 to develop a 1-gigawatt, AI-focused data center campus in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The project, spanning about 400 acres in Visakhapatnam, is among the largest announced in India and underscores growing interest from both domestic and global investors in building AI-ready infrastructure in the country. Separately, Adani Group said in December it plans to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/indias-adani-seeks-up-5-billion-investment-google-data-center-join-ai-boom-2025-11-28/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invest up to $5 billion</a> alongside Google in its AI data center project in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, scaling up data center capacity in India may prove difficult, as patchy power availability, high electricity costs, and water scarcity pose <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-file-100-billion-data-centre-boom-tests-resource-limits-2025-12-03/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">key constraints</a> for energy-intensive AI workloads. Those challenges could slow construction and raise operating costs for cloud providers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The announcements on data centers signal that they are being treated as a strategic business sector rather than just back-end infrastructure,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner of New Delhi-based The Quantum Hub, a public policy and tech consulting firm. The push is likely to attract more private investment and strengthen India’s position as a regional data and compute hub, though execution challenges around power availability, land access, and state-level clearances remain, he added.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagar Vishnoi, co-founder and director of Noida-based think tank Future Shift Labs, said India’s data-center power capacity is projected to surpass 2 gigawatts by 2026, up from just over 1 gigawatt currently, and could expand more than fivefold to exceed 8 gigawatts by 2030, driven by capital investments of more than $30 billion. While the budget signals clear intent to accelerate digital infrastructure and cloud computing, Vishnoi said allowing foreign cloud firms to earn profits tax-free until 2047 reflects a “strategic bet on global Big Tech,” even as India could produce its own technology champions over the next two decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that routing services to Indian users through reseller entities could leave smaller domestic players competing for thin margins, rather than receiving comparable upstream incentives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The federal budget also stepped up incentives to deepen India’s role in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, as the country seeks to move beyond assembly and capture more value in global supply chains. The federal government would launch a second phase of the India Semiconductor Mission, the finance minister said, focused on producing equipment and materials, developing full-stack domestic chip intellectual property, and strengthening supply chains, while backing industry-led research and training centers to build a skilled workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, the Indian government has raised the outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to ₹400 billion (around $4.36 billion), from ₹229.19 billion (about $2.50 billion), after the program — launched in April 2025 — attracted investment commitments at more than double its original target, Sitharaman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This scheme offers incentives tied to incremental production and investment, reimbursing a portion of costs for companies that manufacture key components such as printed circuit boards, camera modules, connectors, and other parts used in smartphones, servers, and data-center hardware. By linking payouts to actual output rather than upfront subsidies, the program is designed to draw global suppliers deeper into India’s electronics supply chain and reduce reliance on imported components — a long-standing criticism of the country’s manufacturing push.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside increasing the spending allocation for the electronics components scheme, the federal budget also proposed a five-year tax exemption starting in April for foreign companies supplying equipment and tooling to electronics toll manufacturers operating in bonded zones. The change is likely to benefit companies including Apple, which relies heavily on contract manufacturing in India and has previously been reported to have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/apple-lobbies-india-change-tax-law-seen-hindering-its-expansion-sources-say-2025-10-15/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sought clarity from New Delhi</a> on the tax treatment of high-end iPhone production equipment supplied to its partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The budget also sought to address vulnerabilities in critical minerals, as India <a href=\"https://www.forbesindia.com/article/take-one-big-story-of-the-day/the-rare-earth-magnet-shortage-what-can-indian-automakers-do/96320/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">grapples</a> with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ny24j0r3o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tightening global supplies of rare earth materials</a> used in electric vehicles, electronics devices, and defense systems. The finance minister said the federal government would support mineral-rich states including Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu in establishing dedicated rare-earth corridors to promote mining, processing, research, and manufacturing. The move builds on a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-26/india-approves-815-million-rare-earth-plan-to-spur-local-output\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">seven-year incentive program</a> approved in late 2025 to boost domestic production of rare-earth magnets, as access to supplies from China — which dominates global output — has become more constrained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond AI infrastructure and electronics manufacturing, the Indian government also moved to boost cross-border e-commerce, aiming to help smaller businesses tap global demand. The finance minister said the existing ₹1 million (around $11,000) value cap per consignment on courier exports would be removed, a move expected to benefit small manufacturers, artisans, and startups selling overseas through online platforms. The federal government would streamline the handling of rejected and returned shipments using technology, addressing a long-standing bottleneck for exporters, Sitharaman said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, the latest measures emphasize India’s ambition to position itself as a long-term hub for global technology infrastructure, spanning cloud computing, electronics manufacturing, and critical minerals. The strategy aims to capitalize on surging AI demand and shifting supply chains. Nonetheless, its success will hinge on execution — from reliable power and water for data centers to sustained support for domestic innovation — as global companies and investors weigh whether India can translate policy incentives into durable leadership in the AI era.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Thirty years ago, we’d be talking about General Electric. Today, we’re talking about Elon Musk. He’s the CEO of Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX, which also owns the telecoms company Starlink. He owns the social media platform X. He’s developing neural implants and underground tunnels. He’s put at least $10 million behind <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/elon-musk-reportedly-donated-10-million-to-a-fertility-research-project/\">fertility research</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also appears to be merging several of these ventures into <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">one conglomerate</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has frequently been likened to Henry Ford. A more apt comparison might be to John D. Rockefeller or Jack Welch, who took GE from an ailing industrial company into a sprawling conglomerate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Welch comparison could turn out to be particularly valid if Musk follows through on rumors that he’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">trying to merge some combination of SpaceX, xAI and Tesla</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The similarities aren’t all encompassing, of course. GE was a company, and Musk is a person. But the distinction can get a bit blurry in an era when his net worth eclipses the market cap of 97% of the S&amp;P 500. In fact, Musk’s net worth is approaching $800 billion, almost as much as GE at its peak when adjusted for inflation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its height, GE was often inseparable from its chairman, Jack Welch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk, the individual, captivates many of his peers, just like Welch did. Executives today talk of being “hardcore” and espouse “first-principles thinking,” just like CEOs of the 1980s sought to emulate Welch through “accretive” mergers and mass layoffs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Musk’s empire spans Tesla, SpaceX, xAI (including with X), Neuralink, and The Boring Company, all companies with very different goals. Sure, Teslas drive through The Boring Company’s holes, xAI’s Grok is available in the automaker’s vehicles, and Tesla has supplied its Megapack batteries to xAI’s data centers. But apart from sharing Musk’s ownership or leadership, they’ve had limited interaction with each other until recently, when Tesla and SpaceX <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/spacex-to-invest-2-billion-into-elon-musks-xai-413934de\">separately</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tesla-invested-2b-in-elon-musks-xai/\">invested</a> in xAI.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-everything-company\">The everything company</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At one time, not so long ago, GE was the world’s most valuable company, with divisions that made light bulbs, jet engines, home appliances, X-ray and ultrasound machines, steam turbines, locomotives, and television shows, among dozens of others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Welch took the helm of GE in 1981, he inherited a company adrift, having <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/ges-split-unravels-massive-management-mistake\">lost a fifth of its market cap</a> in the preceding decade. His first move was to trim headcount. In fact, he laid off so many employees — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/01/1101505691/short-term-profits-and-long-term-consequences-did-jack-welch-break-capitalism\">more than 100,000</a> in his first few years — that he became known as “Neutron Jack,” an allusion to the neutron bomb, which eliminates people while leaving buildings intact.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the savings, Welch went out and acquired company after company. Many of them manufactured stuff, similar to GE’s existing businesses. But some, like NBC, which Welch bought in 1986, did not. That one was added to the portfolio to expand the company’s influence. (Sound familiar?)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his tenure as chairman of GE, Welch was revered for his management abilities, with rival CEOs emulating his management style. The company’s management training program was put on the same pedestal as top business schools, and several of his proteges went on to run Fortune 500 companies themselves. Through a relentless series of layoffs and acquisitions, Welch had turned GE into a money printing machine. The company grew from $14 billion when he took over to over $400 billion when he left in 2001. Shareholder dividends only went up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Welch’s approach wasn’t ironclad. In 2001, his last year at GE, the company’s share price declined. By the time the 2008 financial crisis hit, it was clear that the company’s conglomerate structure was hiding some grievous flaws. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Profits from GE Capital were used to paper over poor performance in other divisions. When it became clear that GE Capital was deep into questionable financial instruments, fractures in the business model widened. GE Capital was ultimately bailed out by the federal government to the tune of $139 billion, but the shine was off. Five years ago, GE announced that it would split itself into three separate companies. The conglomerate was no more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from Welch, Musk might have another comparison a bit farther back in history, before GE became the prototypical conglomerate. “I think it’s much more of a robber baron story than a GE conglomerate story,”<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6577\"> David Yoffie</a>, professor at Harvard Business School, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gilded-age-ceo\">Gilded Age CEO</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Gilded Age, he said, people like J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller controlled large, powerful companies that built new industries like railroads and oil companies. They controlled those firms either directly or through board seats they influenced, and they could mix and match companies as they pleased.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that’s much more the type of approach that Elon is taking,” Yoffie said. “It’s much more about ego, market power, and trying to be the kingmaker.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the robber barons’ power came from two sources: their tremendous wealth and the lack of regulation at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wealth disparities have grown similarly large in recent years. John D. Rockefeller’s wealth was equal to a percentage point or two of the United States’ total GDP, about the same as Musk’s today. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What’s different, of course, is that there was no regulatory framework whatsoever during the period of the Gilded Age,” Yoffie said. “Today, we obviously live in a much more heavily regulated world, but we’re also at the moment living in a world in which regulation is getting pulled back and therefore is less and less of a constraint.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What ultimately happens to Musk and his empire will depend both on the direction he decides to take things — to merge his companies or keep them separate — and how society responds to his growing power. Musk, like his Gilded Age predecessors, has been attempting to put his thumb on the scales, spending more than $300 million trying to influence <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\">elections</a> in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/05/12/record-100m-spent-on-wisconsin-supreme-court-race-raises-concerns-over-judicial-independence/\">U.S.</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/musk-rallies-far-right-europe-tesla-is-paying-price-2025-03-04/\">abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Musk ends up merging one or more of his companies, he’ll end up with a true conglomerate, something that’s not in vogue today. Conglomerates in the U.S. emerged as a way for investors to hedge risk by buying shares in one company that has businesses that are counter-cyclical, Yoffie said. If one division hits a rough patch, others can pick up the slack to keep revenue and profit smooth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Most of that strategy and approach was debunked in subsequent decades,” he said. Investors tend to do better when they buy shares in more specialized companies, which are able to operate more efficiently. Conglomerates also make it difficult to disentangle the different businesses to accurately determine their value. “It’s well known in finance that there’s a conglomerate discount,” Yoffie said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merger talk aside, the biggest constraint on Musk’s companies might be regulation, which is ultimately driven by public opinion. The tycoons of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries found their power ultimately checked by a wave of new regulations introduced in the Progressive Era. Musk has a knack for embracing visions of the future that captivate people’s imaginations and translating them into business plans. The question is, how long will he be able to keep it up?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Until <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/founders-and-vcs-back-a-pan-european-c-corp-but-an-eu-inc-has-a-rocky-road-ahead/\">a pan-European corporate structure</a> exists (often called “EU Inc”), this split will remain common — and we’ve decided to overlook it. Take <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/vibe-coding-startup-lovable-raises-330m-at-a-6-6b-valuation/\">Lovable</a>, which is incorporated in Delaware but cannot be dissociated from Stockholm’s startup scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Second: valuation doesn’t equal commercial success, and it is too early to tell whether all of these companies will achieve the kind of traction that Lovable has, with the company recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/SebJohnsonUK/status/2017339797644153021\">crossing $300 million in annual recurring revenue</a>. But in the current climate, the fact that VCs were willing to invest in them at unicorn valuations is a strong signal of where the appetite is. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With these caveats out of the way, let’s dive in.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-aikido-nbsp\">Aikido </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Belgium-based cybersecurity startup <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aikido.dev/\">Aikido Security</a> reached unicorn status with its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/14/3218567/0/en/Aikido-Security-Raises-60-Million-Series-B-at-1-Billion-Valuation-to-Lead-Software-Security.html\">$60 million Series B</a> funding round.

So Tobaccowala turned to something she knew well: surveys. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given my love of surveys, I surveyed a ton — a ton — of customers,” said Tobaccowala, who used to be president and CTO of SurveyMonkey. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What she found was that people were struggling to figure out how to lower their utility bills. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we talked to consumers, we heard the same thing over and over again: They get that email that says, ‘Hey, you spend more money than your neighbors,’” she said. “They were sort of stuck with what to do about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tobaccowala co-founded <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.homeboost.com/\">HomeBoost</a> to help people conduct their own home energy assessments.

As people walk around their homes, the infrared camera shows them where cold (or hot) air is seeping into their homes; the blacklight tells people which lights could be upgraded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using data from the scans, the app then automatically generates a report which suggests the most cost effective upgrades, including rebates based on where the person lives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many parts of the country, utilities offer a similar service. Utilities, which are incentivized to reduce end users’ energy use, often work with energy auditors to survey people’s homes to identify ways to trim their consumption. But the quality of those services can be very uneven, Tobaccowala said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We talked to a bunch of consumers who’d gotten home energy assessments done, and there this feeling that was like ‘all they did was try to sell me up an upgraded HVAC,’” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The HomeBoost app is cheaper and faster than an auditor, and it helps people feel more in control of the process, Tobaccowala said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HomeBoost charges customers $99, which is about a quarter the cost of a traditional, in-person assessment. It is also working with utilities, which cover some or all of the cost for customers. The startup has signed deals with Central Hudson, Omaha Public Power District, and more recently Avista. Omaha Power, for example, pays for all but $19 of the cost, while Central Hudson will cover the entire cost if homeowners check out the BoostBox from a public library.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But not every homeowner wants to complete the survey process themselves, and not every auditor is a pushy salesperson. Dedicated auditors can spend between two and 10 hours surveying homes, collating data, and building reports, Tobaccowala said. For that, HomeBoost has developed a version of its app for professionals, allowing them to serve more customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also testing a feature that will link homeowners with contractors who can follow through on the upgrades outlined in the report. For contractors, it’s another source of new business, and it allows them to get information on a project before even setting foot inside a home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing consumers, utilities, and contractors together, Tobaccowalla hopes that HomeBoost can ultimately deliver on the climate front, too. “It’s a very unique situation where everybody’s aligned to actually lower the utility bill, which in the net result is improvement on the climate,” she said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This comes months after the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/a16z-pauses-its-famed-txo-fund-for-underserved-founders-lays-off-staff/?_thumbnail_id=3064752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">firm paused TxO and laid off most of its staff</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work,” Ampadu wrote in the email, sent Friday afternoon, with the subject line “Closing My a16z Chapter.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ampadu led the program, which launched in 2020, for over four years until its pause last November, taking over for the initial leader, Nait Jones. Afterward, Ampadu <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/kofi-ampadu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">seems to have worked at a16z’s</a> latest accelerator, Speedrun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ampadu’s departure perhaps signals the end of the TxO chapter. The fund and program focused on supporting underserved founders by providing access to tech networks and investment capital through a donor-advised fund. Though some founders spoke highly of the program, others criticized the controversial donor-advised structure. The program also launched a grant program in 2024 to provide $50,000 to nonprofits that help diverse founders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its last cohort was in March 2025, and its indefinite pause came as many top tech names reframe, cut, or eliminate prior public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We’ve reached out to a16z and Ampadu for comment. <br><br>His full note below:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I moved to the United States three months before my 11th birthday. One month later, I started 6th grade in a school more than 5,000 miles from my home, my friends, and everything familiar. Recently, my mom reminded me that my school required me to enroll as an English-as-a-Second-Language student. My memory immediately returned to how confused I felt. Even at 10 years old, I knew it made no sense that a kid from Ghana, an English-speaking country, was being asked to learn a language he already spoke fluently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a systems requirement, a blanketed assumption about what students from certain places could or could not do. That same type of systemic assumption is what we set out to challenge through the Talent x Opportunity Initiative. The venture ecosystem often relies on proxies such as schools, networks, and prior credentials, which can obscure exceptional founders who do not follow the most common paths. TxO invested in and supported these overlooked founders to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work. Identifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As I move on to my next chapter, I leave with pride in what we built and gratitude for everyone who helped shape it. Thank you for the trust, the collaboration, and the belief in what is possible. There is more work to do and I am excited to keep building.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

When I walk in, I’m immediately confronted with activity. There’s no reception desk, no gleaming logo in fluorescent lights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inside, the space is a giant concrete box made slightly less austere by a haphazard sprawl of long blonde-wood tables. Some are clearly meant for lunch, dotted with Girl Scout cookie boxes, jars of Vegemite (someone here is Australian), and small wire baskets stuffed with one too many condiments. The rest of the tables tell a different story entirely. Many more of them are laden with monitors, spare robotics parts, tangles of black wire, and fully assembled robotic arms in various states of attempting to master the mundane.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During my visit, one arm is folding a pair of black pants, or trying to. It’s not going well. Another is attempting to turn a shirt inside out with the kind of determination that suggests it will eventually succeed, just not today. A third — this one seems to have found its calling — is quickly peeling a zucchini, after which it is supposed to deposit the shavings into a separate container. The shavings are going well, at least.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots,” Sergey Levine tells me, gesturing toward the motorized ballet unfolding across the room. Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley and one of Physical Intelligence’s co-founders, has the amiable, bespectacled demeanor of someone who has spent considerable time explaining complex concepts to people who don’t immediately grasp them. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3088330\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4029-rotated.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos for TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What I’m watching, he explains, is the testing phase of a continuous loop: data gets collected on robot stations here and at other locations — warehouses, homes, wherever the team can set up shop — and that data trains general-purpose robotic foundation models. When researchers train a new model, it comes back to stations like these for evaluation. The pants-folder is someone’s experiment. So is the shirt-turner. The zucchini-peeler might be testing whether the model can generalize across different vegetables, learning the fundamental motions of peeling well enough to handle an apple or a potato it’s never encountered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.pi.website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">company</a> also operates a test kitchen in this building and elsewhere using off-the-shelf hardware to expose the robots to different environments and challenges. There’s a sophisticated espresso machine nearby, and I assume it’s for the staff until Levine clarifies that no, it’s there for the robots to learn. Any foamed lattes are data, not a perk for the dozens of engineers on the scene who are mostly peering into their computers or hovering over their mechanized experiments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hardware itself is deliberately unglamorous. These arms sell for about $3,500, and that’s with what Levine describes as “an enormous markup” from the vendor. If they manufactured them in-house, the material cost would drop below $1,000. A few years ago, he says, a roboticist would have been shocked these things could do anything at all. But that’s the point — good intelligence compensates for bad hardware.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Levine excuses himself, I’m approached by Lachy Groom, moving through the space with the purposefulness of someone who has half a dozen things happening at once. At 31, Groom still has the fresh-faced quality of one of Silicon Valley’s boy wonders, a designation he earned early, having sold his first company nine months after starting it at age 13 in his native Australia (this explains the Vegemite).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first approached him earlier, as he welcomed a small gaggle of sweatshirt-wearing visitors into the building, his response to my request for time with him was immediate: “Absolutely not, I’ve got meetings.” Now he has 10 minutes, maybe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Groom found what he was looking for when he started following the academic work coming out of the labs of Levine and Chelsea Finn, a former Berkeley PhD student of Levine’s who now runs her own lab at Stanford focused on robotic learning. Their names kept appearing in everything interesting happening in robotics. When he heard rumors they might be starting something, he tracked down Karol Hausman, a Google DeepMind researcher who also taught at Stanford and who Groom had learned was involved. “It was just one of those meetings where you walk out and it’s like, This is it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Groom never intended to become a full-time investor, he tells me, even though some might wonder why not given his track record. After leaving Stripe, where he was an early employee, he spent roughly five years as an angel investor, making early bets on companies like Figma, Notion, Ramp, and Lattice while searching for the right company to start or join himself. His first robotics investment, Standard Bots, came in 2021 and reintroduced him to a field he’d loved as a kid building Lego Mindstorms. As he jokes, he was “on vacation much more as an investor.” But investing was just a way to stay active and meet people, not the endgame. “I was looking for five years for the company to go start post-Stripe,” he says. “Good ideas at a good time with a good team — [that’s] extremely rare. It’s all execution, but you can execute like hell on a bad idea, and it’s still a bad idea.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3088332\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4030-rotated.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos for TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two-year-old company has now raised <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-20/robotics-startup-physical-intelligence-valued-at-5-6-billion-in-new-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over $1 billion</a>, and when I ask about its runway, he’s quick to clarify it doesn’t actually burn that much. Most of its spending goes toward compute. A moment later, he acknowledges that under the right terms, with the right partners, he’d raise more. “There’s no limit to how much money we can really put to work,” he says. “There’s always more compute you can throw at the problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What makes this arrangement particularly unusual is what Groom doesn’t give his backers: a timeline for turning Physical Intelligence into a money-making endeavor. “I don’t give investors answers on commercialization,” he says of backers that include Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital among others that have valued the company at $5.6 billion. “That’s sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that.” But tolerate it they do, and they may not always, which is why it behooves the company to be well-capitalized now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what’s the strategy, if not commercialization? Quan Vuong, another co-founder who came from Google DeepMind, explains that it revolves around cross-embodiment learning and diverse data sources. If someone builds a new hardware platform tomorrow, they won’t need to start data collection from scratch — they can transfer all the knowledge the model already has. “The marginal cost of onboarding autonomy to a new robot platform, whatever that platform might be, it’s just a lot lower,” he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is already working with a small number of companies in different verticals — logistics, grocery, a chocolate maker across the street — to test whether their systems are good enough for real-world automation. Vuong claims that in some cases, they already are. With their “any platform, any task” approach, the surface area for success is large enough to start checking off tasks that are ready for automation today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Physical Intelligence isn’t alone in chasing this vision. The race to build general-purpose robotic intelligence — the foundation on which more specialized applications can be built, much like the LLM models that captivated the world three years ago — is heating up. Pittsburgh-based Skild AI, founded in 2023, just this month raised $1.4 billion at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/robotic-software-maker-skild-ai-hits-14b-valuation/\">$14 billion valuation</a> and is taking a notably different approach. While Physical Intelligence remains focused on pure research, Skild AI has already deployed its “omni-bodied” Skild Brain commercially, saying it generated $30 million in revenue in just a few months last year across security, warehouses, and manufacturing. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3088334\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4027-rotated.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Connie Loizos for TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Skild has even taken public shots at competitors, <a href=\"https://www.skild.ai/blogs/building-the-general-purpose-robotic-brain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">arguing on its blog</a> that most “robotics foundation models” are just vision-language models “in disguise” that lack “true physical common sense” because they rely too heavily on internet-scale pretraining rather than physics-based simulation and real robotics data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a pretty sharp philosophical divide. Skild AI is betting that commercial deployment creates a data flywheel that improves the model with each real-world use case. Physical Intelligence is betting that resisting the pull of near-term commercialization will enable it to produce superior general intelligence. Who’s “more right” will take years to resolve.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Physical Intelligence operates with what Groom describes as unusual clarity. “It’s such a pure company. A researcher has a need, we go and collect data to support that need — or new hardware or whatever it is — and then we do it. It’s not externally driven.” The company had a 5- to 10-year roadmap of what the team thought would be possible. By month 18, they’d blown through it, he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has about 80 employees and plans to grow, though Groom says hopefully “as slowly as possible.” What’s the most challenging, he says, is hardware. “Hardware is just really hard. Everything we do is so much harder than a software company.” Hardware breaks. It arrives slowly, delaying tests. Safety considerations complicate everything.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Groom springs up to rush to his next commitment, I’m left watching the robots continue their practice. The pants are still not quite folded. The shirt remains stubbornly right-side-out. The zucchini shavings are piling up nicely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are obvious questions, including my own, about whether anyone actually wants a robot in their kitchen peeling vegetables, about safety, about dogs going crazy at mechanical intruders in their homes, about whether all of the time and money being invested here solves big enough problems or creates new ones. Meanwhile, outsiders question the company’s progress, whether its vision is achievable, and if betting on general intelligence rather than specific applications makes sense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Groom has any doubts, he doesn’t show it. He’s working with people who’ve been working on this problem for decades and who believe the timing is finally right, which is all he needs to know. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides, Silicon Valley has been backing people like Groom and giving them a lot of rope since the beginning of the industry, knowing there’s a good chance that even without a clear path to commercialization, even without a timeline, even without certainty about what the market will look like when they get there, they’ll figure it out. It doesn’t always work out. But when it does, it tends to justify a lot of the times it didn’t.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal would value the platform at $5.5 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The source said that of that $5.5 billion, $3.5 billion would be equity and $2 billion would be debt. Under those terms, Architect would assume a 60% stake in the business. The two parties are in exclusivity, meaning that OnlyFans is barred from negotiating with other potential buyers for a set period of time. It’s unclear what the timeline for completing the deal might be.

It’s unclear what happened to those discussions, although the source told TechCrunch that there had been a number of interested parties since OnlyFans announced its desire to sell a majority stake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potential business partner in this particular deal, Architect, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/architect-capital-brings-alternative-capital-to-the-early-stage-with-new-100m-fund/\">launched in 2021</a> as an asset-based lender — a firm that provides loans secured by company assets — that looks to partner with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation/\">early-stage startups</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OnlyFans maintains that it’s not a pornography website, despite the fact that a majority of the creators on it produce adult content.

After a legal challenge from Claude’s maker, Anthropic, it had briefly rebranded as Moltbot, but has now settled on OpenClaw as its new name.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest name change wasn’t prompted by Anthropic, which declined to comment. But this time, Clawdbot’s original creator Peter Steinberger made sure to avoid copyright issues from the start. “I got someone to help with researching trademarks for OpenClaw and also asked OpenAI for permission just to be sure,” the Austrian developer told TechCrunch via email.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The lobster has molted into its final form,” Steinberger wrote in a <a href=\"https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. Molting — the process through which lobsters grow — had also inspired OpenClaw’s previous name, but Steinberger confessed <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2017106396483833900\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on X</a> that the short-lived moniker “never grew” on him, and others agreed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This quick name change highlights the project’s youth, even as it has attracted over 100,000 GitHub stars (a measure of popularity on the software development platform) in just two months. According to Steinberger, OpenClaw’s new name is a nod to its roots and community. “This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The OpenClaw community has already spawned creative offshoots, including Moltbook — a social network where AI assistants can interact with each other. The platform has also attracted significant attention from AI researchers and developers. Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former AI director, called the phenomenon “genuinely the most incredible <a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017296988589723767?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing</a> I have seen recently,” noting that “People’s Clawdbots (moltbots, now OpenClaw) are self-organizing on a Reddit-like site for AIs, discussing various topics, e.g. even how to speak privately.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">British programmer Simon Willison described Moltbook as “the most interesting place on the internet right now” in a <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/30/moltbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post on Friday</a>. On the platform, AI agents share information on topics ranging from automating Android phones via remote access to analyzing webcam streams. The platform operates through a skill system, or downloadable instruction files that tell OpenClaw assistants how to interact with the network. Willison noted that agents post to forums called “Submolts” and even have a built-in mechanism to check the site every four hours for updates, though he cautioned this “fetch and follow instructions from the internet” approach carries inherent security risks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger had taken a break after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/pspdfkit-raises-116m-its-first-outside-money-now-nearly-1b-people-use-apps-powered-by-its-collaboration-signing-and-markup-tools/\">exiting his former company PSPDFkit</a>, but “came back from retirement to mess with AI,” per his X bio. Clawdbot stemmed from the personal projects he developed then, but OpenClaw is no longer a solo endeavor. “I added quite a few people from the open source community to the list of maintainers this week,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That additional support will be key for OpenClaw to reach its full potential. Its ambition is to let users have an AI assistant that runs on their own computer and works from the chat apps they already use. But until it ramps up its security, it is still inadvisable to run it outside of a controlled environment, let alone give it access to your main Slack or WhatsApp accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger is well aware of these concerns, and thanked “all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project.” Commenting on OpenClaw’s roadmap, he wrote that “security remains our top priority” and noted that the latest version, released along with the rebrand, already includes some improvements on that front.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even with external help, there are problems that are too big for OpenClaw to solve on its own, such as prompt injection, where a malicious message could trick AI models into taking unintended actions. “Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem,” Steinberger wrote, while directing users to a <a href=\"https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">set of security best practices</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These security best practices require significant technical expertise, which reinforces that OpenClaw is currently best suited for early tinkerers, not mainstream users lured by the promise of an “AI assistant that does things.” As the hype around the project has grown, Steinberger and his supporters have become increasingly vocal in their warnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a message posted on Discord by one of OpenClaw’s top maintainers, who goes by the nickname of Shadow, “if you can’t understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely. This isn’t a tool that should be used by the general public at this time.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truly going mainstream will take time and money, and OpenClaw has now started to accept sponsors, with lobster-themed tiers ranging from “krill” ($5/month) to “poseidon” ($500/month). But its sponsorship page makes it clear that Steinberger “doesn’t keep sponsorship funds.” Instead, he is currently “figuring out how to pay maintainers properly — full-time if possible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Likely helped by Steinberger’s pedigree and vision, OpenClaw’s roster of sponsors includes software engineers and entrepreneurs who have founded and built other well-known projects, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Morin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Path’s Dave Morin</a> and Ben Tossell, who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/zapier-buys-no-code-focused-makerpad-in-its-first-acquisition/\">sold his company Makerpad to Zapier</a> in 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tossell, who now describes himself as a tinkerer and investor, sees value in putting AI’s potential in people’s hands. “We need to back people like Peter who are building open source tools anyone can pick up and use,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company says the feature is still in the early stages and is not being tested publicly yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The social network’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/instagram-brings-close-friends-feature-to-the-main-feed/\">Close Friends</a> feature lets users share Stories, Reels, and posts with a select group of people, rather than their entire follower base. Since the feature’s launch in 2018, users haven’t been able to remove themselves from someone else’s Close Friends list.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The internal prototype was first spotted by reverse engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2016898237207134249\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who specializes in finding unreleased features while they’re still under development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a screenshot shared by Paluzzi, Meta will warn users that if they leave a Close Friends list, they won’t be able to see that person’s Close Friends content unless that person adds them back to their list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some people would undoubtedly feel offended if others leave their Close Friends list, the feature would likely be a welcome addition for those who’d rather not be included on certain people’s lists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Snapchat, one of Instagram’s main competitors, already allows its users to remove themselves from someone’s private story — a similar feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with any other internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Instagram plans to release the feature publicly. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond Close Friends updates, Instagram is also working on other new features. Meta told TechCrunch earlier this week that it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/meta-to-test-premium-subscriptions-on-instagram-facebook-and-whatsapp/\">plans to test new subscriptions</a> that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta didn’t share details about which specific features these subscriptions will include, Paluzzi shared that a premium subscription on Instagram will allow users to create unlimited audience lists, see which followers don’t follow them back, and view Stories without the poster knowing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta said its goal with the upcoming subscriptions is to give users access to special features and more control over how they share and connect, while keeping the core experiences free. The company doesn’t appear to be locked into one strategy, as it plans to test a variety of subscription features and bundles with each app subscription offering a distinct set of exclusive features.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company had previously suggested it was going to use the third New Glenn launch to send its robotic lunar lander to the moon, but that spacecraft is still undergoing testing at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Texas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since retaking office, President Donald Trump has put pressure on NASA to send astronauts back to the moon before the end of his second term. That has cleared the way for companies other than SpaceX to compete for these missions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The decision reflects Blue Origin’s commitment to the nation’s goal of returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent, sustained lunar presence,” the company wrote Friday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blue Origin first flew the New Shepard rocket more than a decade ago, and it became the first rocket to go to space and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/24/9790510/blue-origin-reusable-rockets-vertical-landing-spacex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">safely land back on Earth</a>. Unlike SpaceX’s Falcon 9, though, the New Shepard rocket was never intended to reach Earth orbit. Its utility has therefore been limited to space tourism flights, which allow passengers around four minutes of weightlessness in Blue Origin’s space capsule, and science missions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said Friday that New Shepard has flown 38 times and carried 98 humans to space, along with more than 200 scientific and research payloads. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New Shepard program was previously paused in 2022 after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/12/blue-origin-launch-aborted-after-mid-flight-anomaly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one of the company’s boosters exploded mid-flight</a>.

His response:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“<em>The news that SpaceX may be considering various transactions with xAI and Tesla, has caused a temporary pause in the market for SpaceX shares, as shareholders and investors sort through the implications of these potential transactions.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>As both SpaceX and Tesla look to expand their business identities beyond their core businesses to reflect their future leadership in AI, the merger of any of these entities is increasingly intriguing.</em>“</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-greg-welcome-to-the-show-before-we-dive-in-can-you-share-a-bit-about-your-background\"><strong>Greg, welcome to the show. Before we dive in, can you share a bit about your background?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m founder and managing director of Rainmaker Securities, which specializes in helping large late-stage, pre-IPO companies transact shares in the secondary market. I am also the founder of a secondary firm that buys private company shares called Archer Capital Group, and co-founder of Liquid Stock, a business that helps employees and executives exercise their options using their shares as collateral. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-i-m-sure-the-secondaries-business-has-been-booming-with-this-ipo-drought-from-the-past-couple-years\"><strong>I’m sure the secondaries business has been booming with this IPO drought from the past couple years.</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No doubt. Private companies are staying private much longer now. Many of these businesses — including SpaceX and other companies that would be top 30 in the S&amp;P 500 — would historically have gone public years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies are significant in our economy, and investors really want access to these companies. At the same time, there are shareholders and executives and founders who have been in them for a long time and want to start seeing some liquidity from their shares, which are a very high percentage of their net worth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So these two forces have created a thriving secondary market. And we only see this trend growing because more market cap is now housed in the private markets.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-imagine-the-secondary-markets-shifting-if-we-have-a-break-in-ipos-this-year\"><strong>Do you imagine the secondary markets shifting if we have a break in IPOs this year?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an interesting question, because clearly when a SpaceX goes public, you could argue that $800 billion has just left the private system and is now in the public markets. But I think it just increases interest in more companies offering liquidity, and more investors coming into private markets. While SpaceX is a one-of-kind company, there are a lot of companies that are being started today and that are growing very fast. I mean, three or four years ago, what were OpenAI and Anthropic valued at? Those are now over a trillion dollars of combined market cap. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I really see the trend of the opportunity in the private secondary spaces as growing overall, and frankly, when we see the matriculation of SpaceX to the public markets, I think it’s going to actually increase the capital market interest in private companies.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-some-things-you-re-noticing-around-the-spacex-ipo\"><strong>What are some things you’re noticing around the SpaceX IPO?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you think about the IPO market the last few years, it’s been pretty dismal since 2021, so the markets are really waiting for a bellwether company. And I think SpaceX is clearly a bellwether company…and there’s a huge amount of interest in that company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX also just did a tender at an $800 billion valuation, and we see a ton of interest on our platform at Rainmaker in continuing to buy into the secondary. And it’s not just SpaceX. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re seeing a lot of interest in some of the other bellwether companies, whether it’s ByteDance, whether it’s Stripe, Databricks, obviously OpenAI, Anthropic, the AI businesses, Perplexity. So there is a lot of interest, but SpaceX, I think, is the one that people are following the most closely. And I really think it could create a reset in the IPO market if it were to go public this year.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-kind-of-bid-movement-are-you-seeing-on-your-platform\"><strong>What kind of bid movement are you seeing on your platform?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has continued to defy gravity. Even during the down periods of ‘22 and ‘23, SpaceX was the one company that continued to price up every time there was a hint of the company going public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We have seen a significant uptick in interest, both from a size and a price point — it’s already pricing well above where the last tender round was and getting closer to that trillion and a half that they had discussed as a potential IPO price.  </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-elon-musk-famously-said-he-wouldn-t-take-spacex-public-until-rockets-were-flying-to-mars-regularly-why-is-he-racing-to-the-public-markets-now\"><strong>Elon Musk famously said he wouldn’t take SpaceX public </strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-elon-musk-is-racing-to-take-spacex-public-38f3de9b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfq0GfzojoJ-k3M7XZBNp__L48XVCpA0_sqJY4wLcZuGqsMGks9anL8I2wHfwM%3D&amp;gaa_ts=697780c0&amp;gaa_sig=pAYkhG2WVQzZ8OQxNyY9mDBVhWjsopXzG5vt-lfpYqRv0cdDx4LO9CQBP38AO1Oa4hZxqtvrHn_Domszvfpm3Q%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>until rockets were flying</strong></a><strong> to Mars regularly. Why is he racing to the public markets now?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been private for a long time, so I wouldn’t say he’s racing to go public, although his stance has shifted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are in a very good market, we’re at all-time highs across the board. SpaceX has seen a large amount of interest in the private markets, but the private markets are constrained. Not every investor on the planet can access the private markets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has a huge opportunity in front of it. They dominate the rocket-launching business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They’re building an amazing Starlink business. They have Starship, which has so many businesses related to it, whether it’s sending bulk payloads into space or logistics around the world. Now they’re talking about building data centers in space, and as a truly vertically integrated company, they can manage it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And so it just makes sense, given the positive market dynamics and massive potential opportunity that SpaceX could address across its many business lines. Why not go and unlock all the rest of the capital markets to help them fund their businesses?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-spacex-has-been-traditionally-pretty-tight-about-who-can-join-its-cap-table-there-are-a-lot-of-national-security-risks-so-they-can-t-have-any-links-to-u-s-adversaries-will-opening-up-to-the-public-markets-affect-that-nbsp-nbsp\"><strong>SpaceX has been traditionally pretty tight about who can join its cap table. There are a lot of national security risks so they can’t have any links to U.S. adversaries. Will opening up to the public markets affect that?  </strong><strong> </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You could argue that it does open up that potential risk channel. I think if they do a public offering, it’ll probably be a sliver deal, so only 5% of their company that’s technically available. Now we’ll see what happens, but at least things will be out in the open and publicly disclosed, so they can see who owns their shares. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question will then become, do any of these companies — even if they’re in adversarial countries — have any real control? If they’re just economic interests, that’s something that can be tolerated. The reality is, Elon and a pretty tight-knit group of people will still continue to control the company. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-said-it-s-not-a-race-to-ipo-but-it-certainly-feels-that-way-now-in-part-because-of-elon-musk-s-public-feud-with-sam-altman-who-is-also-chasing-close-to-a-1-trillion-ipo-altman-is-also-looking-to-buy-stoke-space-while-bezos-is-talking-about-orbital-data-centers-a-lot-of-rivals-appear-to-be-converging-on-a-similar-mission-nbsp\"><strong>You said it’s not a race to IPO, but it certainly feels that way now, in part because of Elon Musk’s public feud with Sam Altman, who is also chasing close to a $1 trillion IPO. Altman is also looking to buy Stoke Space, while Bezos is talking about orbital data centers. A lot of rivals appear to be converging on a similar mission. </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX’s success is going to breed some imitation. We’ve heard now that Bezos is going to launch a communication network to compete with Starlink, but they’re a long way behind. And OpenAI has its own set of capital risks in the core business that they have to address. So for them to go public makes a ton of sense, because the AI trade is still very hot in the public markets. They have an insatiable need for capital right now, if you look at their burn rate. So there’s no point in them constraining the investors that can access their company, because right now they need capital. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think SpaceX can be a little more measured. They can find the right time when the market presents itself well, because they have a business that is largely profitable, and they have dominance in their two key businesses. So they’re in the driver’s seat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If there’s any downdraft in the market, I think they’ll stay private. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-not-all-roses-for-spacex-they-are-facing-their-own-challenges-launching-starship-v3-and-several-of-their-aircraft-have-exploded-over-the-past-year-but-a-lot-of-that-might-not-matter-since-this-is-an-elon-musk-company-and-those-tend-to-do-well-in-terms-of-stock-price-just-off-the-back-of-his-name-how-do-you-think-the-spacex-ipo-will-be-priced-relative-to-what-its-actual-balance-sheet-says-versus-the-impact-of-elon-musk-and-his-empire-nbsp\"><strong>It’s not all roses for SpaceX. They are facing their own </strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/spacex-eyes-mid-march-for-first-test-of-upgraded-starship-rocket/\"><strong>challenges</strong></a><strong> launching Starship V3, and several of their aircraft have exploded over the past year. But a lot of that might not matter since this is an Elon Musk company, and those tend to do well in terms of stock price just off the back of his name. How do you think the SpaceX IPO will be priced relative to what its actual balance sheet says, versus the impact of Elon Musk and his empire? </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It will definitely get a premium multiple. There’s an Elon halo effect, and he’s delivered. Even though Tesla’s primary revenues come from automobiles, it’s completely vertically integrated. It captures data. It now has self-driving taxis. It has Optimus robots –</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-got-a-minimal-rollout-of-self-driving-taxis-and-optimus-is-still-years-away\"><strong>It’s got a minimal rollout of self-driving taxis and Optimus is still years away…</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robots are the future at Tesla. Tesla is really a state of the art manufacturing company, and Elon owns xAI, Twitter, SpaceX — these companies can be very virtuous. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I do think there’s a halo effect around Elon and that creates some pressure, too. So I expect he will get a premium well and above what typical market rates would be for a company like SpaceX, given their balance sheet and revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think people believe in the future of a data center in space that’s cooled by space and run by solar panels directly from the sun. I mean, it sounds crazy and pie in the sky, just like going to Mars sounds crazy and pie in the sky. But if anyone can do it, Elon’s probably the guy.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-say-that-but-he-hasn-t-actually-done-a-lot-of-the-weird-pie-in-the-sky-stuff-that-he-has-promised-to-do-in-fact-others-have-beat-him-to-the-punch-especially-when-it-comes-to-full-self-driving-nbsp\"><strong>You say that, but he hasn’t actually done a lot of the weird pie in the sky stuff that he has promised to do. In fact, others have beat him to the punch, especially when it comes to full self-driving. </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That will be debated by investors and will be where the tension is. When you put so much value in the belief that one person can exceed expectations continuously, that’s a big challenge. And some people will not be comfortable with that risk. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-significant-is-it-that-spacex-is-lining-up-banks-for-a-2026-ipo\"><strong>How significant is it that SpaceX is lining up banks for a 2026 IPO?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a pretty big signal. I don’t think they’re just playing games.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-but-having-a-conversation-with-banks-doesn-t-necessarily-mean-the-ipo-is-coming-this-year-what-are-some-other-signals-that-people-could-watch-for-when-a-company-is-getting-ready-to-go-public-not-just-spacex-but-anyone\"><strong>But having a conversation with banks doesn’t necessarily mean the IPO is coming this year. What are some other signals that people could watch for when a company is getting ready to go public — not just SpaceX, but anyone?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Look at the people they hire and if that portends more of an IPO senior executive team versus an entrepreneurial team. If they seem really focused on a chief accounting officer from a public company. Or if there’s a swap out and a new CFO comes in with deep public company experience. If they’re beefing up their investor relations team, accounting, legal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like SpaceX have had public-grade teams for a while, so I don’t think there’s a lot to learn there.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-zooming-out-a-little-bit-how-would-you-say-private-market-valuations-typically-compare-to-what-companies-achieve-in-their-ipos\"><strong>Zooming out a little bit, how would you say private-market valuations typically compare to what companies achieve in their IPOs?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a good sign for private companies to pre-understand their demand. If a company didn’t have that and they basically had to rely on a two-week marketing period from when they file publicly or if they start a road show where they only talk to top accountants, that’s often when you have a really difficult pricing environment because they’re not getting proper price discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So we’re really pushing companies to actually open up your private secondary capability because it’s a great way to develop price discovery well in advance of the IPO, to start getting people attached to your business, to open yourself up to a broader investor base. That way, by the time you do go on your road show, you actually have a pretty good view of what your price should be, and you end up with a much more efficient IPO. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Think about when Figma went public and traded up 200% — that’s not really a good IPO. That’s a company that probably didn’t do very good price discovery in advance. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-walk-us-through-how-secondaries-actually-work-let-s-say-i-m-a-spacex-employee-with-stock-options-what-are-my-options-before-ipo-nbsp\"><strong>Walk us through how secondaries actually work. Let’s say I’m a SpaceX employee with stock options. What are my options before IPO? </strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All private companies are not created equally. SpaceX has very tight controls on their cap table, partially because they don’t want to exceed the number of shareholders, at which point they would have to be a public company. And so Space X, unlike most companies, runs tender offers two or three times a year, so there tends to be a reasonable amount of liquidity for employees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now there’s also what I would call the SPV (special purpose vehicle) world that trades in SpaceX, where people put their shares in SPVs and then trade units in their SPVs, rather than the shares themselves. So there actually isn’t a cap table change, but there is an economic ownership change by virtue of trading units in the SPV. That’s where most of the trading in SpaceX lies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whereas some companies allow trading of shares directly on their cap table, and some companies absolutely prohibit all secondary transactions, which I don’t think is a good idea. That’s why people work with firms like Rainmaker, because we get to know the companies. We get to know how they monitor and guard trades so we can help get those trades done. We can help provide liquidity for people who want it. We can provide either ownership of the shares or ownership in the economics of the shares for investors.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-say-access-to-information-is-one-of-an-investor-s-biggest-problems-in-the-secondary-markets-does-rainmaker-help-provide-information\"><strong>You say access to information is one of an investor’s biggest problems in the secondary markets. Does Rainmaker help provide information?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We work with some companies where we’re provided data rooms and can provide access to information. We do our own research on anything publicly available and have a view of supply and demand dynamics. So we have a lot of information we can provide, but we can’t share inside company information unless the company allows it. Increasingly, we’re helping companies with those processes. The more information we can provide, the lower the risk for investors, and that tends to open up markets. But it’s an evolving process. These are private companies for a reason — they’re guarded with what they want to share, and we’re very respectful of that.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-sophisticated-investors-looking-for-when-they-buy-pre-ipo-shares-at-this-scale\"><strong>What are sophisticated investors looking for when they buy pre-IPO shares at this scale?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just like a traditional investor, they would want to be able to do their due diligence across financials, across management. They certainly would like an understanding of the cap table — like how many shares are outstanding, what’s the preferences? What does this price represent? What’s the debt? They would love to understand what the supply and demand equilibrium is like.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more they have, the better. That’s why they’re more comfortable with more public-facing private companies, like SpaceX — even without exact historical financials — than the less well-known names.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-are-you-seeing-more-of-an-appetite-for-buying-secondary-shares-from-other-late-stage-unicorns-what-companies-would-you-point-to\"><strong>Are you seeing more of an appetite for buying secondary shares from other late-stage unicorns? What companies would you point to?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We continue to see substantial demand for companies like Databricks, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, ByteDance. The AI trade continues to be strong, whether it’s Lambda Labs or Cohere, which is a Canadian company near and dear to my heart. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As companies signal they’re going to go public — like Discord, Motive, Canva — people get a feeling that there’s going to be liquidity, and that’s when we start to see things open. There are probably 20 to 30 companies on our platform that trade pretty regularly, and that just continues to grow. As the IPO market starts to open up, we’re going to see that broaden. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like in 2021, we were trading hundreds of companies, and then as the IPO market closed, and that number compressed. But last year was our biggest year — we were trading over $1 billion worth of secondaries.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-can-our-listeners-connect-with-you-online\"><strong>Where can our listeners connect with you online?</strong></h5>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m on LinkedIn.

Whether that function is drafting content for the marketing department, reviewing risks in documents for a firm’s legal team, or drafting responses for customer support, the plug-in is designed to use agentic automation to streamline work with a specialized focus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says you can use plug-ins to “tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose so your team gets more consistent outcomes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Matt Piccolella, who works on the product team at Anthropic, told TechCrunch that plug-ins are built to be customized and that the company expects enterprise users to create their very own bespoke use cases for them. Anthropic open sourced 11 of its in-house plug-ins as part of the release on Friday, but noted that custom plug-ins are “easy to build, edit, and share” and can be utilized without much technical expertise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plug-ins have already been <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">available within Claude Code</a> for some time, and their expansion into Cowork is merely designed to take that same utility and share it with different kinds of users. “Really, what we’re doing with this launch is just bringing them to Cowork and giving them that kind of user-friendly, UI-centric flavor that will allow the maximum number of people to use them,” Piccolella said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Piccolella pointed to data analysis and sales as two departments within Anthropic where plug-ins have already shown promise. “Sales has been a really big one, both for our direct sales people, but then also just getting anybody who’s kind of sales adjacent, better connected to the customer and customer feedback and all of that,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says that the more enterprise users utilize plug-ins, the more Claude knows about a company’s workflows and how to optimize them. Currently, plug-ins get saved locally to a user’s machine, although Anthropic says that an organization-wide sharing tool is on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cowork, which just released about two weeks ago, is currently in its research preview. It’s unclear when it will launch more widely. For the time being, plug-ins will be available to all paying Claude customers, Anthropic says.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Of those, 235 million posts contained media, accounting for 62% of all media posts shared on Bluesky to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also reported a fivefold increase in legal requests from law enforcement agencies, government regulators, and legal representatives in 2025, with 1,470 requests, up from 238 requests in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company previously shared moderation reports in <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2023</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-17-2025-moderation-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2024</a>, this is the first time it’s put together a comprehensive transparency report. The new report tackles other areas outside of moderation, like regulatory compliance and account verification information, among other things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-moderation-reports-from-users-jump-54\"><strong>Moderation reports from users jump 54%</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compared with 2024, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/bluesky-saw-17x-increase-in-moderation-reports-in-2024-after-rapid-growth/\">Bluesky saw a 17x increase</a> in moderation reports, the company this year reported a 54% increase, going from 6.48 million user reports in 2024 to 9.97 million in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the number jumped, Bluesky noted that the growth “closely tracked” its 57% user growth that occurred over the same period.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around 3% of the user base, or 1.24 million users, submitted reports in 2025, with the top categories being “misleading” (which includes spam) at 43.73% of the total, “harassment” at 19.93%, and sexual content at 13.54%. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A catch-all “other” category included 22.14% of the reports that didn’t fall under these categories, or others like violence, child safety, breaking site rules, or self-harm, which accounted for much smaller percentages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within the “misleading” category’s 4.36 million reports, spam accounted for 2.49 million reports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, hate speech accounted for the largest share of the 1.99 million “harassment” reports, with about 55,400 reports. Other areas that saw activity included targeted harassment (about 42,520 reports), trolling (29,500 reports), and doxxing (about 3,170 reports).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Bluesky said that the majority of “harassment” reports included those that fell into the gray area of antisocial behavior, which may include rude remarks, but didn’t fit into the other categories, like hate speech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most of the sexual content reports (1.52 million) concerned mislabeling, Bluesky says, meaning that adult content was not properly marked with metadata — tags that allow users to control their own moderation experience using Bluesky’s tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A smaller number of reports focused on nonconsensual intimate imagery (about 7,520), abuse content (about 6,120), and deepfakes (over 2,000).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reports focused on violence (24,670 in total) were broken down into subcategories like threats or incitement (about 10,170 reports), glorification of violence (6,630 reports), and extremist content (3,230 reports).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to user reports, Bluesky’s automated system flagged 2.54 million potential violations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One area where Bluesky reported success involved a decline in daily reports of antisocial behavior on the site, which dropped 79% after the implementation of a system that identified toxic replies and reduced their visibility by putting them behind an extra click, similar to what X does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky also saw a drop in user reports month-over-month, with reports per 1,000 monthly active users declining 50.9% from January to December.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png\" alt=\"a graph showing the number of reports, with most of the reports filed in the month of January 2025 featuring mostly violence, harassment, and other categories.\" class=\"wp-image-3088248\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png 1313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1200,720 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1280,768 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=720,432 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=900,540 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=800,480 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=668,401 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=625,375 625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=1028,617 1028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=708,425 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-report-chart.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of moderation, Bluesky noted it removed 3,619 accounts for suspected influence operations, most likely those operating from Russia. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-increases-in-takedowns-legal-requests\">Increases in takedowns, legal requests</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said last fall it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/bluesky-says-its-getting-more-aggressive-about-moderation-and-enforcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">getting more aggressive</a> about its moderation and enforcement, and that appears to be true.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Bluesky took down 2.44 million items in 2025, including accounts and content. The year prior, Bluesky had taken down 66,308 accounts, and its automated tooling took down 35,842 accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moderators also took down 6,334 records, and automated systems removed 282.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png\" alt=\"a screenshot showing a pie chart, showing a number of takedowns by Bluesky's policies.\" class=\"wp-image-3088245\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png 1836w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=768,764 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=680,676 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=1200,1193 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=1280,1273 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=430,428 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=720,716 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=900,895 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=800,796 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=1536,1528 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=668,664 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=377,375 377w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=620,617 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=534,531 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-transparency-pie-chart.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1836px) 100vw, 1836px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky also issued 3,192 temporary suspensions in 2025, and 14,659 permanent removals for ban evasion. Most of the permanent suspensions were focused on accounts engaging in inauthentic behavior, spam networks, and impersonation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, its report suggests that it prefers labeling content more than it does booting out users. Last year, Bluesky applied 16.49 million labels to content, up 200% year-over-year, while account takedown grew 104% from 1.02 million to 2.08 million. Most of the labeling involved adult and suggestive content or nudity.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
