Kalshi users can also trade on when MrBeast will get married, or when his company, Beast Industries, will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/could-mrbeast-ipo-his-ceo-wants-fans-to-have-a-chance-to-be-owners-of-the-company/\">announce an IPO</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch reached out to a Beast Industries representative for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi says that Kaptur traded around $4,000 on YouTube streaming markets in August and September 2025. He made a $5,397.58 profit, prompting Kalshi to fine him for that amount, plus a $15,000 penalty. Kalshi also banned Kaptur for two years. The company said in its blog post that it will donate the fine to a consumer education non-profit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi also fined <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kalshi-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/regulatory/notices/Notice%20of%20Disciplinary%20Action%20(2.25.2026)%20(2).pdf\">Kyle Langford</a>, a candidate for political office in California, who traded about $200 on his own candidacy, then posted about it on social media.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The markets on platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket are so vast that it’s challenging to ensure that the users trading on them are not using private knowledge to their advantage, which is against the rules. When it comes to securities like stocks, similar behavior is punishable by up to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/25743/000138713113000737/ex14_02.htm\">20 years</a> in federal prison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potential for these markets to be manipulated has drawn attention among U.S. lawmakers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, one Polymarket user suspiciously <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/05/nx-s1-5667232/polymarket-maduro-bet-insider-trading\">bet $32,000</a> that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro would be removed from power by the end of January — just hours later, the U.S. military captured Maduro, earning that user a $400,000 payout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, Representative Ritchie Torres (D-NY) proposed <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritchietorres.house.gov/posts/in-response-to-suspicious-polymarket-trade-preceding-maduro-operation-rep-ritchie-torres-introduces-legislation-to-crack-down-on-insider-trading-on-prediction-markets\">legislation</a> that would make it illegal for government employees to trade on prediction markets related to government policy, government actions, or political outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mansourtarek_insider-trading-is-banned-on-kalshi-and-activity-7414691318947532800-ZPk9/?rcm=ACoAAAfCS4oBBsd-zF23gA1uc0N8O093XF2k324&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;utm_source=share\">said in a Linkedin post</a> last month that he supports the bill, since Kalshi already adheres to the rules it would enforce. He claimed that alleged insider trading cases are not occurring on U.S.-based platforms (both Kalshi and Polymarket are based in the U.S.).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This American bill only applies to regulated, American companies and not to unregulated, non-American companies, which is where the alleged issues are occurring,” Mansour wrote. “Prediction markets, like any industry, are not a monolith: there are important distinctions that matter.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anger has grown so loud that it’s begun to shift legislative agendas. Some states and communities are mulling temporary bans on new data center development altogether. Earlier this month, New York joined the club, with a bold new proposal to halt the local cloud build-out in its tracks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S9144\">A new bill</a> in New York State would impose a three-year moratorium on the issuance of new permits for data center construction throughout the state, while local regulators are given a chance to study the environmental and economic impacts the industry is having on communities. The bill’s co-authors, State Senator Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Anna Kelles, have called the legislation the “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/ny-data-center-moratorium\">strongest</a>” introduced in the country.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While no statewide moratoriums have passed so far, local bans are proliferating fast. Several weeks before Krueger and Kelles introduced their bill, the New Orleans City Council <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wwno.org/economy/2026-01-29/new-orleans-city-council-bans-data-center-development-for-a-year-heres-why\">passed a moratorium</a>, pausing all new data center construction in the city for a period of a year. In early January, Madison, WI <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cityofmadison.com/council/district3/blog/2026-01-11/proposal-to-establish-a-temporary-moratorium-on-new-data-centers\">passed a similar law</a> after protests erupted over regional tech projects. Similar policies have also passed in droves of communities throughout construction hotspots like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/2026/01/20/outrage-over-surge-of-data-centers-in-georgia-inspires-wave-of-bipartisan-bills/\">Georgia</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/at-least-19-michigan-towns-pause-data-centers-no-one-knows-if-itll-work/\">Michigan</a>, as well as in many other regions throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02122023/virginia-environmentalists-protest-data-centers/\">Environmental activists</a> have long taken aim at data centers, but the more recent concerns have come from high-level lawmakers, drawing on populist anger at the tech industry broadly. In conservative Florida, for instance, Gov. Ron DeSantis recently announced an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/governor-ron-desantis-announces-proposal-citizen-bill-rights-artificial\">AI “bill of rights”</a> that gives local communities the right to limit new data center construction. In liberal Vermont, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/07/congress/democrats-reject-bernie-sanders-data-center-pause-00713664\">suggested a nationwide moratorium</a>. And in Arizona, where the political milieu is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-do-we-need-to-know-about-the-swing-state-of-arizona/\">decidedly mixed</a>, Gov. Katie Hobbs recently said she supported <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/12/arizona-governor-reverses-support-for-data-center-tax-breaks-00723160\">pulling the industry’s tax incentives</a>. Politicians have even begun to fight over the topics, with the governor of Mississippi <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/tatereeves/status/2026309465901859025?s=61\">taking shots</a> at Sanders online over his moratorium proposal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The political resistance is coming just as tech companies commit more and more money to building out infrastructure. The four biggest spenders — Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft — plan to spend <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\">a whopping $650 billion</a> in capital expenditures over the next year, the vast majority of it going to data center buildouts. Even more spending is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">planned in the following years</a>, as the companies race to secure as much compute capacity as possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the speed and scale of those projects has made them increasingly unpopular, according to recent polling. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/PeterHamby/status/2026122722779238770?s=20\">A recent Echelon Insights poll</a> found 46% of respondents would oppose plans to build a data center in their community, compared with 35% in support. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/tech-industry-ai-data-centers-politics-00762348?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us\">A different poll</a> from Politico found that, while there is considerable concern about the facilities, many voters don’t have much of an opinion either way—making it possible for public sentiment to be swayed in either direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry is already spending big to attempt to change those numbers — at least in the regions where it matters. In January, the Financial Times <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45d45fc-c0ea-463c-8edf-38fb99ed5c05\">reported that</a> some of the industry’s biggest data center operators were planning a “lobbying blitz,” with plans to “boost spending on targeted advertising and engagement” aimed at the communities where they build.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies are also making real concessions, like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/andrewcurran_/status/2026720928093319354?s=46&amp;t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw\">the planned Rate Payer Protection Pledge</a> that would make them responsible for supplying power to any new AI data centers. But it’s not clear those measures will be enough to bring the public around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dan Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition, argued, in a conversation with TechCrunch, that data centers should appeal to smaller communities because they provide revenue without straining those communities’ limited resources. If the incentives are cut off and companies decide not to build in those places, the revenue also won’t be there. “That’s where statewide policy considerations come in,” he said. “Are you going to limit communities in which these businesses could be a significant benefit for them?” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-logic-behind-pressing-pause\">The logic behind pressing pause </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In general, data center moratoriums are meant to give communities breathing room while policymakers study the potential costs and benefits of allowing such facilities to be built in their communities. The <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial-builders-are-losing-their-appetite-to-build-anything-but-data-centers-945c594f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdlypBXrI_34rqvisxw0GblBV3dyNkIpIywQd-BxLwWhC3H_9EEJ1JTaK-o1ec%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6998b29d&amp;gaa_sig=klkOc9jtIRM8Zd9PUsV7FiBwbC23qs6CMGKisf_1m1R6Rwz0PNZL7DnNagJbB3zRRZNbyGTsjGZIsl5eX_GFwA%3D%3D\">rate of construction</a> in some states has accelerated at such a pace that communities are unsure of how the industry will impact them in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Justin Flagg, director of communications and environmental policy for Sen. Krueger’s office, told TechCrunch that the legislation was driven, in part, by what he called the energy affordability crisis in New York. Said crisis has troubled both rate-payers and politicians. A group of 30 state lawmakers recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqKSTQWtN-I\">called upon</a> the state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, to declare an “energy state of emergency” in the state due to rate increases. While there are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nysfocus.com/2025/09/18/new-york-energy-bill-hikes\">a diversity of factors</a> at work in driving up energy prices, there’s a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/\">consensus</a> that the growth in data centers is making the problem worse, not better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s broad discontent being expressed about energy prices,” Flagg said. “We certainly hear that constantly from our constituents, whose electric and gas rates are going up.” He added that local pushback was also being driven by environmental concerns—which he described as the “water impact and the noise and the local infrastructure impact as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to those grid concerns, major tech companies — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/?p=3082319&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=3029459\">Microsoft</a>, Google, Meta, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/864798/openai-data-center-opposition-energy-bills\">OpenAI</a>—have promised to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/climate/big-tech-warren-electricity-data-centers\">pay for their additions to the electrical grid</a> in the communities where they operate, often installing behind-the-meter power sources paired with the new data centers. The Washington Post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2026/02/19/data-centers-power-grid-ai/\">recently reported</a> that Silicon Valley is increasingly looking to build its own private electrical supply—a kind of “shadow grid”—that can be used to operate the power-consumptive properties that are now fueling the AI industry. The strategy involves standing up massive new private power sources instead of relying on the public grid. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One example of this practice comes from xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup, which—at the site of its massive data center in Memphis, Tennessee, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/xais-colossus-supercomputer-raises-health-questions-in-memphis/\">known as “Colossus”</a>—built a series of methane gas turbines which have been accused of polluting the local community. The company’s efforts have already run into significant trouble. xAI had <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/15/elon-musk-xai-datacenter-memphis\">reportedly</a> told local officials that, due to a legal loophole, the turbines were exempt from air quality permits. In January, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/epa-rules-that-xais-natural-gas-generators-were-illegally-used/\">ruled that</a> Musk’s company was not exempt from the permits, making their previous operation illegal. Environmental activists, decrying the facility’s discharge of “smog-forming pollution, soot, and hazardous chemicals,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/xai-built-an-illegal-power-plant-to-power-its-data-center/\">announced</a> earlier this month that they planned to sue the company over it. Musk’s facility has since permitted its turbines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the xAI example illustrates, if the “shadow grid” strategy purports to solve one problem (public grid overload), it threatens to create a host of new ones—with environmental activists and local communities alike <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/big-tech/datacenter-developers-leverage-natural-gas-to-sidestep-power-grids-short-term-solution-might-increase-carbon-emissions-and-prove-costly-in-the-long-run\">expressing concern</a> for how the new facilities could spew pollution into people’s backyards. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the federal level, the Trump administration — which has made AI one of its top priorities — has also sought to characterize the industry as responsible stewards of the communities in which they build. Indeed, Trump officials have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/navarro-trump-data-centers-affordability.html\">floated a hypothetical policy</a> to force AI companies to internalize the costs of their additions to local electrical grids, although the details on this policy remain vague.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-debate-over-taxes\">Debate over taxes</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, communities have incentivized data center development through tax breaks. Last summer, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/tax-breaks-for-tech-giants-data-centers-mean-less-income-for-states.html\">an analysis by CNBC</a> found that 42 states throughout the U.S. either have no sales tax or provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to tech firms. Of that number, some 16 states publicly reported how much they had awarded to companies through tax breaks. The forfeited revenue amounted to some $6 billion over a period of five years, the outlet wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, however, more and more states are thinking about turning off the spigot. In Georgia, for instance, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/2026/01/20/outrage-over-surge-of-data-centers-in-georgia-inspires-wave-of-bipartisan-bills/\">a variety of bills were recently introduced</a> that would crack down on the industry’s benefits. State Sen. Matt Brass, who has introduced a bill that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.times-herald.com/news/sen-brass-files-bill-to-end-tax-break-for-future-data-centers/article_191fcf25-113d-42d4-8404-fd68f1f8b925.html\">would nix the server sales tax exemption</a>, told TechCrunch that he doesn’t think tech companies need the extra money, nor does he think dispensing with the benefit will dissuade them from doing business in the state. “In Georgia, if you compare us to other states, our property taxes are low, our property values are low, our overall tax burden is low,” Brass said. “So, you know, our overall business climate is good. That should be the attraction.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brass, who chairs the state’s rules committee, told TechCrunch that he expects there to be significant support for his policy. A similar piece of legislation passed the Georgia legislature in 2024, but it was vetoed by the governor. Brass added that, were the exemption to be done away with, he believes it could generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Ohio, a similar policy battle is currently playing out. A group of Democratic lawmakers recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/02/09/ohio-democrats-offer-slate-of-bills-reining-in-data-centers/\">introduced legislation</a> that would—like in Georgia—move to nix the state’s sales tax exemption. A similar policy was introduced last year, but—like in Georgia—it was defeated by the state’s governor, Mike DeWine. “The most ridiculous tax break on the books currently is for data centers,” one of the bill’s supporting lawmakers, state Sen. Kent Smith, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wowktv.com/news/ohio-lawmakers-consider-repealing-tax-breaks-for-data-centers/\">recently said</a>. “That tax break needs to end, for the benefit of everyone who’s got an electric bill.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, there are still plenty of lawmakers who support the server sales tax exemption. In Colorado, State Representative Alex Valdez <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/HB26-1030\">recently introduced a bill</a> that would enshrine data centers’ loophole for the next 20 years. Valdez told TechCrunch that the exemption is merely a carrot to get tech companies in the door. Once they set up a base of operations in the state they become a source of passive revenue that inevitably boomerangs back to benefit the communities in which they operate, he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Operating there successfully would strengthen Waymo’s case that its system is nationally scalable. It also gives Waymo another shot at a northern city after New York <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/new-york-driverless-rideshare-nyc-waymo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped a proposal</a> that would have allowed commercial robotaxi pilots in parts of the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes the same week Waymo began offering commercial driverless operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-operating-in-10-us-cities/\">bringing its total city count to 10.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from Chicago and Charlotte, Waymo is also testing and planning to launch in Denver, London, and Washington, D.C., among other cities.

These automations join other Gemini improvements shipping today, including an expansion of scam detection for phone calls and Circle to Search updates that now let you identify all the items on your phone’s screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The automations, explains Google, allow users to essentially offload their to-do list to Gemini. In practice, however, the types of things that Gemini can manage are still limited.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says that the feature, which is in beta, will initially support select apps in the food, grocery, and rideshare categories. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It will also be limited to the Gemini app on certain devices, including the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S26 series. And it will initially be available only in the U.S. and Korea.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096764\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png 7020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-with-task-Automation-1.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-powered automations could potentially go wrong, of course, so Google has added some protections. For starters, the automations can’t be kicked off without an explicit command from the device’s owner. As they run, you can watch their progress in real time and stop the task if it’s making a mistake or getting stuck. Google notes also that the automations take place in a secure, virtual window on your phone where they can only access limited apps, not the rest of the data on your device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature ties into the growing trend of using AI to automate more tasks in users’ personal lives. ChatGPT, for instance, lets <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-tasks-in-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">users create tasks</a> that can be run on schedules or at specific times, as well as offering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/openai-launches-a-general-purpose-agent-in-chatgpt/\">an agent </a>that can complete a variety of computer-based tasks like navigating a calendar, generating a slideshow, or running code. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropics-new-cowork-tool-offers-claude-code-without-the-code/\">Anthropic’s Cowork</a>, meanwhile, brings the capabilities of its Claude AI to non-coding tasks, letting non-developers automate everyday file and task management. And, of course, an AI tool called <a href=\"https://openclaw.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenClaw</a> recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/everything-you-need-to-know-about-viral-personal-ai-assistant-clawdbot-now-moltbot/\">went viral</a> for its ability to manage everyday tasks like sending emails, managing calendars, checking into flights, and more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1.-Gemini-powered-Scam-Detection-alerts.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096765\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another Gemini update arriving now is the expansion of a Scam Detection feature for phone calls, which is becoming available on Samsung Galaxy S26 series devices in the U.S. (The feature is already offered on Pixel phones in the U.S., Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, and the U.K.) Google is also using its Gemini on-device model to detect scam texts in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. on Pixel 10 series devices, and soon on the Galaxy S26 series phones, as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, Google says its Circle to Search feature, which lets you use gestures like scribbles and circling to initiate searches, can now search for everything you’re seeing on the phone screen, not just a single object. That means you can search every item of clothing and every accessory in an outfit you like, or learn more about a group of things and the related topic on the screen.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096763\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png 3144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=1280,722 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=1094,617 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/0.-Header.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google has been steadily releasing Gemini updates to its Android ecosystem at regular intervals through new operating system updates and updates targeted toward its flagship phone, the Google Pixel, via its frequent updates <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/11/google-pixel-update-adds-battery-saving-maps-mode-ai-photo-remixing-and-smarter-notifications/\">known as Pixel Drops</a>.

The company rolled out ads <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-rolls-out-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to U.S.-based users earlier this month</a> amid criticism from rivals like Anthropic, which published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/sam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads/#:~:text=own%20chatbot%2C%20Claude.-,Another%20commercial,-features%20a%20slight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a string of Super Bowl ads</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the sidelines of the India AI summit, TechCrunch asked <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/openai-coo-says-we-have-not-yet-really-seen-ai-penetrate-enterprise-business-processes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap</a> about how the company is approaching ads. Lightcap said that the process is iterative and the company has to get user privacy and trust right.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Well, this is going to be an iterative process for sure. This is something we are committed to getting right. What does that look like? It means obviously maintaining user trust at a very high level. It means getting privacy right,” Lightcap said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also noted that ads can add to the product experience of users if they are done right. He urged to give OpenAI a few months to see how the company fares in rolling out the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It means really creating a delightful product experience. We think ads done right can be additive to a product experience. And so it’ll take iteration, it’ll take time, but we’re just starting out. So maybe give us a few months and see how it goes,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightcap didn’t specify if the company is thinking about rolling out ads beyond the U.S. market at the moment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Sam Altman hit back at Anthropic with <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019139174339928189%7Ctwgr%5Ea4b3a014b37f8325129952141c9fb783ac0afcb0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fsam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads%2F\">a long post on X</a> about the Super Bowl ads, calling the OpenAI rival “dishonest” and accusing them of making an expensive product that serves “rich people.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency.

From his own experience, the best way to build today is to explore, be playful, and not expect to be an expert at what you do right away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I wish I could say that I had the unified plan in the beginning, but a lot of it was just exploration,” Steinberger said. “I wanted things, and those things didn’t exist, and … let’s say I prompted them into existence.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The developer was chatting with OpenAI’s Head of Developer Experience, Romain Huet, on the first episode of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jgcT0Fqt7U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the company’s new Builders Unscripted podcast</a>. Here, he spoke about what OpenClaw was like in its early days and how he didn’t have a plan when he got started.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger explained he began by building a tool that would integrate with WhatsApp, but then set it aside for a bit and focused on other things, as he assumed the AI labs would build something like what he was working on in the near future.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I just experimented a lot. My mission was, kind of like, to have fun and inspire people,” Steinberger noted. By last November, however, the developer was surprised that no AI labs had started to build what he wanted to use. That led him to create the initial prototype of what’s now OpenClaw. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where it really clicked was where I was at this weekend trip in Marrakesh, and I found myself using it way more because it was so convenient … There was no really good internet. [But] WhatsApp just works everywhere,” he said. The tool made it easy for him to find restaurants, look up things on his computer, send texts to friends, and more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Builders Unscripted: Ep. 1 - Peter Steinberger, Creator of OpenClaw\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jgcT0Fqt7U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more he played with the technology, Steinberger realized how good modern AI models have become at problem-solving, much like coders are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now they can just, like, actually come up with the solutions themselves, even though you never programmed them at all,” he noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Throughout the process of building, Steinberger said that his workflow improved — and he stresses to other developers that’s something that can take time, so don’t give up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s these people that … write software in the old way, and the old way is going to go away,” he pointed out. They then decide to try vibe coding but are disappointed with the results.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think vibe coding is a slur,” said Steinberger, basically suggesting that it’s not as simple a process at first as the term makes it sound. “They try AI, but they don’t understand that it’s a skill,” he said, then compared the process of coding with AI to learning guitar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re not going to be good at guitar on the first day,” he said. Instead, he recommends that people approach learning with a more playful attitude. If he writes a prompt now, he has a gut feeling as to how long it will take, and if it takes longer, he reflects on what may have gone wrong and adapts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My … advice always is, approach it in a playful way. Build something that you always wanted to build. If you’re at least a little bit of a builder, there has to be something on the back of your mind that you want to build. Like, just play.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to experiment and have fun is what’s most important, especially at a time when people are worried their jobs will be overtaken by AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If your identity is: I want to create things. I want to solve problems. If you’re high agency, if you’re smart, you will be in more demand than ever,” Steinberger said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For the first time this year, podcasts eclipsed spoken-word radio with 40% of listening time, as opposed to 39% for radio.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If anything, it’s surprising that it has taken this long for podcasts to overtake radio shows. (Remember, this doesn’t include listening to music on the radio.) But perhaps that speaks more to the durability of good, old-fashioned radio than the merits of podcasting.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096431\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Edison Research</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We checked with Edison to see if these statistics include video podcasts, and they do. But the need to clarify that question points to the undeniable growing prevalence of video podcasts, hosted on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, which marks another key trend in podcasting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps an industry bellwether, Netflix is inking deals with iHeartMedia and Barstool Sports to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-is-betting-on-podcasts-to-become-the-new-daytime-talk-show/\">bring podcasts to the streaming service</a> as a more trendy version of the daytime talk show. It’s not a bad investment — according to YouTube, people watch them on TV. YouTube said that viewers watched <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcasts-living-room-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">700 million hours</a> of podcasts each month in 2025 on living room devices, like TVs, up from 400 million the previous year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the popularity of video podcasts doesn’t seem to be detracting from audio-first podcast listening. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Triton Digital’s <a href=\"https://podnews.net/press-release/triton-podcast-report-us-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.S. Podcast Report for 2025</a> showed that 80% of consumers over 18 years of age tune into both audio and video podcasts; 13% only listen to audio, while 7% only watch video. Listener preferences also appear to vary greatly depending on a podcast’s genre, with podcasts about topics like music, sports, comedy, and news skewing more popular on video. Genres like science, history, art, fiction, and true crime are more often consumed via audio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Edison’s findings show a similar trend in the role of video in podcasting. Eighty-five percent of weekly U.S. podcast listeners above the age of 13 consume podcasts with any sort of video component, up 7% from 2023. The research also showed that there are an estimated 115 million weekly podcast listeners in the U.S., with only 5% of listeners reporting that they watch podcasts, but don’t listen to them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just last month, Harbinger announced it would start selling its battery packs for energy storage and auxiliary power, with Airstream <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/harbinger-launches-harbinger-industria-announces-140000455.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as the first customer</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger announced Wednesday it has already lined up a customer for Phantom’s advanced driver assistance tech that it just acquired. German automotive technology giant ZF Group has agreed to license that tech from Harbinger, and plans to sell it to automakers for use in their passenger cars. (Terms of the two deals were not disclosed.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger co-founder and CEO John Harris told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview that he expects this new software services business line to generate “millions” of dollars in revenue this year, which he said is mostly “not material” compared to the amount the company will make from selling its truck chassis. The startup recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/harbinger-raises-160m-will-build-trucks-for-fedex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $160 million</a> in a funding round co-led by FedEx and THOR Industries, both of which are customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harris instead expects the ZF Group deal will bring in more significant revenue in 2027 or 2028. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The passenger car market is slower, but the volumes are very, very large,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger was already using Phantom AI’s driver assistance tech, Harris said, and the acquisition will see the companies deepen that integration. Harris expects that to be a big win for Harbinger’s own customers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Medium-duty [trucking] has a complete lack of safety features,” he said. “The majority of medium-duty vehicles on the road that have no backup cameras, no air conditioning, no lane keeping, no automatic emergency braking. It’s just not a thing that exists in the market yet, which is crazy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger already promises a lower total cost of ownership for commercial customers, better emissions compliance, and an easier truck to drive thanks to the simpler, quieter electric powertrain. But Harris thinks the safety features enabled by Phantom’s tech will make Harbinger’s chassis that much better — especially because of how and where they tend to be used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These vehicles, many of them are spending their time navigating around truck ports and pulling in and out of neighborhoods to deliver packages. They’re all in places where there’s a very high safety risk of backing into vehicles, hitting pedestrians, hitting bicyclists, hitting children,” he said. “We need to have, maybe not the cutting-edge 2026 safety features, but we should at least have the safety features that were commodity in 2020 or 2015.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Harbinger’s headquarters are in Los Angeles, California, Phantom AI’s 30 employees — including its leadership team — will remain in Mountain View. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This update gives users of the company’s project management software Jira the ability to assign and manage work for their digital agents from the same dashboard they use for their human employees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents in Jira allows enterprises to assign tasks and tickets to AI agents, just as they would to people. It also tracks how the work is coming along, and sets deadlines, among other metrics. Users can now also loop in AI agents during the middle of an existing project too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This feature is now available in open beta.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This update is meant to give users the same visibility into the work their agents are doing as their human employees, Tamar Yehoshua, Atlassian’s new chief product and AI officer, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Atlassian has been in the business, for decades, of collaboration software helping people get work done,” Yehoshua said. “Now, you enter agents, and agents are now doing a lot of that work, and so you want to be able to coordinate between humans and agents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Atlassian understands that just giving people more avenues to automate doesn’t necessarily mean less work, Yehoshua said. That’s why the key part of this update is that everything happens within the same dashboard, she said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve been hearing in the zeitgeist lately that all of these agents are creating more work for people, and in some ways, more chaos,” Yehoshua said. “What we’re really good at is putting order to that chaos.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As enterprises continue to figure out how and where they can find a return on investment from investing in AI tools, this kind of view could prove beneficial. The ability to compare the work of agents versus humans on the same project could help enterprises figure out where to deploy agents to begin with and what tasks should remain human-led.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This announcement is just the first of many, Yehoshua said, as the company looks to increasingly add AI tools into its existing software products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The goal is to enable people to work more productively with AI and I think this is a step,” Yehoshua said. “It’s only the beginning of the journey. It’s a long journey, but this is a really important step of how to integrate AI into the workflows that you already have, which I’m really excited about.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He spoke openly to TechCrunch about the collapse of that company, saying he never figured out how to make it profitable.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My ego made it hard to accept the failure,” he told TechCrunch. “In hindsight, I should have shut it down a year earlier.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For his next company, he went back to his roots. His family owned an insurance brokerage, and he remembered all the hassles that came when founders like himself walked through the doors, trying to insure their businesses. “I hated insurance,” he continued, “swore I’d never end up in it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But then he had an idea. At first, he and Tushar Nair, a longtime friend and former CTO of Poolit, thought about building AI tools for existing brokerages. Then they decided to just use that technology to build an AI-native insurance brokerage and <a href=\"https://www.harperinsure.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">call it Harper,</a> after Rice’s mother’s maiden name. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in 2024, Harper is part of a trend YC recently wrote about (Harper took part in the YC W25 batch). The YC <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog wrote that the </a>future of agencies “will look more like software companies, with software margins.” That’s exactly what Harper is — an almost fully autonomous licensed commercial insurance agency. It matches small- to mid-sized businesses with more than 160 insurance carriers to assist with workers’ compensation, as well as general and professional liability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What often takes a traditional broker five to seven days, we can often do in one to two,” Rice, the company’s CEO, said. He said a typical sales team at a human-led brokerage handles 20 to 30 deals a month, but AI enables Harper to handle more than 1,000 customers a month. Harper has more than 5,000 customers to date, he continued. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI handles the operational weight.

The second time in the game, he has big dreams for this company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to become the voice for entrepreneurs, starting with their insurance, but over time becoming a focal point for all types of things related to risk, compliance, and their entire back office,” he said. “We want to make it simple for them to do their core work, and we basically do everything else over time.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to clarify the total funding amount. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In a few cases, it even exacerbated the user’s existing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">mental health issues, leading to crises</a> or even suicides, multiple lawsuits have alleged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, chatbot users have shown a preference for controlling how their AI responds, even writing <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1m16j8c/what_custom_instruction_do_you_all_use_to_change/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">custom</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40474716\">instructions</a> to dictate the AI’s personality. To address this need, OpenAI launched new ChatGPT features in December that allow users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/openai-allows-users-to-directly-adjust-chatgpts-warmth-and-enthusiasm/\">adjust the AI’s base style and tone</a> in terms of its warmth, enthusiasm, and use of emojis, among other things. Despite this, some users are <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2025723480596255075?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complaining</a> that the latest model is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1rb0go3/chatgpt_crossed_the_line/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">too reassuring</a> by default.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says its new styles for Alexa have been built on five dimensions that contribute to its personality: expressiveness, emotional openness, formality, directness, and humor. Each style represents specific levels of all five factors. For instance, Brief isn’t just concise, it’s also casual, direct, and uses minimal humor, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To change Alexa’s style, you can either speak to the AI assistant via a device, like an Echo speaker, or access the feature in the Alexa app’s Device Settings under “Personality Style.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that these three styles are only the first to ship, and others will be on the way in the future. At present, the styles are only available in the U.S. market. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With Quick Cut, users can describe what they want the video to be in natural language, and the tool will automatically edit out irrelevant parts of the footage, and put together the different takes while using appropriate footage to make transitions between cuts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can also pick frames from the B-roll and use one of the video models available within Firefly to create short transitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can use the prompt box within the Firefly video editor to specify settings like aspect ratio and pacing between transitions, or add optional B-roll footage. Users can apply Quick Cut to the entire project, a particular timeline, or selected clips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe stressed that the aim of Quick Cut is to deliver a first draft, so editors will still need to adjust elements, paste takes together, and work on transitions to put together the video.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we talk to our users, who are creators and marketers, the biggest problem they actually communicate is the need for fast turnaround, the need for time-saving techniques that just let them get to their creative vision as fast as possible,” Mike Folgner, product lead for AI and next-generation video tools, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One thing we do know is that some of the mundane parts that come with video [editing], like just getting the selects in order, that’s not really where they find joy and difference. They find joy in putting their spin on it. So Quick Cut is meant to help creators who have a set of media find the story very quickly and just get to a story cut as fast as possible,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe has been pushing regular updates to its video-related tools. In December, it rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/adobe-firefly-image-5-brings-support-for-layers-will-let-creators-make-custom-models/\">a new timeline-based video editor</a> that brought layers and prompt-based editing — the editor treats different objects as layers and allows you to edit them using prompts, or use tools like resize and rotate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also added <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/adobe-firefly-now-supports-prompt-based-video-editing-adds-more-third-party-models/\">prompt-based editing capabilities</a> to Firefly, letting users tell the video model how to edit video elements, colors, and camera angles, as well as a timeline view that lets you adjust frames, sounds, and other characteristics easily.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Investing was exciting, but Gerlach was yearning to get back into entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While at Cornell, Gerlach (pictured above, right) built and sold a <a href=\"https://www.cornellsun.com/article/2019/03/student-startup-partners-with-cornell-dining-to-deliver-breakfast-to-your-doorstep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">food delivery startup</a> alongside classmate Pedro Bobrow (pictured above, left), a Brazilian native. Then in late 2022, Gerlach and Bobrow (previously a product manager at Lyft) teamed up again, merging their sector expertise and cultural roots to launch Comp, an HR tech startup focused on Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Comp is building AI-powered HR software that can assist with tasks like recruiting, setting compensation policies, and designing performance review systems. The startup also provides “forward-deployed” experts — former HR executives — who work with customers to design strategies for compensation, performance, and recruiting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While companies in Brazil often hire compensation consultants, Gerlach says its forward-deployed HR executives shouldn’t be viewed as consultants, but rather as extensions of existing HR teams. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These executives also play a critical role in refining Comp’s technology. “Our forward-deployed HR execs do all the work manually at first, and then they use that work to train the AI how to think in best practices,” Gerlach said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea, of course, is that over time, Comp’s AI agents will become fully autonomous and capable of performing traditional HR functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Comp currently offers AI-supported HR services augmented by professionals, its goal is to displace both traditional consultancies and HR software. As Gerlach puts it: “Rippling sells software to junior HR teams to make them more productive. We become the HR team.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To that end, Comp this week raised a $17.25 million Series A round led by Khosla Ventures, marking the VC firm’s first-ever investment in a Brazilian company. Khosla general partner Keith Rabois has joined Comp’s board of directors as part of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Comp is positioning itself as an AI alternative to traditional compensation consultancies like Mercer, Korn Ferry, and Willis Towers Watson. It also competes with global HR platforms such as Rippling and Workday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gerlach says Comp launched in Brazil because many companies in the country lack traditional HR software, which has allowed the startup to introduce a new, automated model rather than competing with established platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The business model seems to have already gained traction in Brazil: Its clients include Nubank, QuintoAndar, Creditas, and “pretty much every unicorn in Brazil,” Gerlach said. The startup is now eyeing an expansion into the U.S. and other countries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other investors in Comp’s Series A included existing backers Kaszek and Canary, as well as new investors Abstract Ventures and Endeavor Catalyst.<br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Viral interest in AI-generated content also helped fuel adoption, with content creation and editing tools accounting for seven of the 20 most downloaded GenAI apps in India in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The user surge has been equally pronounced. India accounted for about 19% of the global user base of leading AI assistant apps in 2025, ahead of the U.S. at 10%, Sensor Tower said. ChatGPT continues to dominate the Indian market by monthly active users, though rivals including Google’s Gemini and Perplexity have also seen rapid growth following promotional offers. ChatGPT was the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/indias-app-downloads-rebounded-to-25-5-billion-in-2025-fueled-by-ai-assistants-and-microdrama-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most downloaded GenAI app</a> in India and globally in 2025, according to earlier Sensor Tower data. Earlier this month, OpenAI’s CEO said that the chatbot now has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more than 100 million weekly active users</a> in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The promotional push in India reflects a broader strategy by AI firms to reduce pricing friction in a highly value-conscious market, betting that early user adoption and engagement will translate into stronger long-term retention once free access periods expire, said Sneha Pandey, insights analyst at Sensor Tower.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s appeal lies in its massive digital base. The country has more than a billion internet users and around 700 million smartphone owners, making it one of the largest potential markets for AI services globally and a critical battleground for user growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, user engagement in India still trails more mature markets. In 2025, users of leading AI chatbot apps in the U.S. spent about 21% more time per week on the apps than their counterparts in India and logged 17% more sessions on average, per Sensor Tower.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI in-app revenues will likely see meaningful but gradual improvement as users become more deeply integrated into these platforms, making sustained engagement paramount,” Pandey told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She added that pricing pressure in India is likely to remain elevated given the country’s young and value-conscious user base, making lower-cost tiers, telecom bundles, and micro-transaction models important for long-term retention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT remained the clear market leader in India entering 2026, with 180 million monthly active users in January, per Sensor Tower, followed by Google’s Gemini with 118 million, Perplexity with 19 million, and Meta AI with 12 million. The figures underline both the scale of India’s AI opportunity and the growing challenge for firms to convert rapid user adoption into sustained revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The funding round illustrates the eagerness among Big Tech, legacy automakers, and the investor community to profit from the burgeoning automated driving industry. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wayve provides what founder and CEO Alex Kendall calls the “contrarian” option in automated driving — contrarian both in its approach to tech and its business model, he told TechCrunch in an interview Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the technology chessboard is set around where different companies have invested on the technology strategy, and now the commercial chessboard is being arranged,” Kendall said. “We took a very contrarian view on the technology side. We were the first to build end-to-end deep learning for autonomous driving, and we pioneered this approach. Now, when it comes to this phase of moving into commercialization, we’re also taking a contrarian business model approach.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://wayve.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wayve</a>, which launched in 2017, uses a self-learning approach to its software. The company developed a software layer using an end-to-end neural network that doesn’t require high-definition maps and only uses data to teach the vehicle how to drive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This data-driven learning approach underpins two products: an “eyes on” assisted-driving system and an “eyes off” fully automated-driving system that could be applied to robotaxis or consumer vehicles that can handle all of the driving in certain environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s pitch to customers is the agnostic nature of its technology, which is not reliant on specific sensors or maps. The automated-driving software captures data from whatever sensors are on the vehicle and directs the system’s driving decisions. Wayve’s software can also run on whatever chip its OEM partners already have in their vehicles.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It should be noted, however, that Nvidia, which is also a backer, has had a close development relationship with Wayve since 2018. The startup’s Gen 3 platform, which was unveiled last fall, uses an in-vehicle compute autonomous vehicle development kit called Nvidia Drive AGX Thor. The Gen 3 platform will allow Wayve to offer eyes-off advanced driving-assistance systems and Level 4 — or fully driverless — features that will work on city streets and highways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s tech is somewhat similar to how Tesla has approached automated driving, although there are key differences in their business models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wayve doesn’t want to be the operator of its hands-free driving-assistance system or its “eyes-off” fully automated-driving system. (For comparison, Waymo is largely the operator of its robotaxis, although it does have partners.) Nor does Wayve want to build vehicles bundled with its own software, as Tesla does. Instead, it is selling its “embodied AI” to automakers and other tech companies like Uber. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kendall argues that this is the business model with the largest addressable market, but he says it’s only viable because Wayve built an AI that generalizes across different hardware and environments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you build an autonomy stack that’s specific to a sensor or compute architecture, [or] if you build it where it requires mapping or something like this, then you can’t take option three,” Kendall said, referring to the business model his company has chosen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nissan and Uber are both Wayve customers. Nissan said the startup’s self-driving software will be used to beef up the advanced driver-assistance system in its cars <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/wayves-self-driving-tech-is-headed-to-nissan-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">starting in 2027</a>. Meanwhile, later this year, Uber plans to launch commercial trials in vehicles equipped with Wayve’s software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its relationship with Uber appears poised to stretch well beyond a pilot program, though. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s statement Tuesday hints at the scope of its partnership with and investment in Wayve. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are very proud to continue to deepen our partnership with Wayve, with plans to deploy together in more than 10 markets around the world. Wayve’s powerful end-to-end approach is purpose-built for scale, safety, and effectiveness, and we’re excited to work with them across multiple OEMs and geographies, which we’ll share more about soon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was led by Eclipse, Balderton, and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. New investors include the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Baillie Gifford, British Business Bank, Icehouse Ventures, Schroders Capital, and other global institutional investors, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global automakers Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis — all of which plan to use Wayve’s technology — also participated. Nvidia, which participated in Wayve’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/06/wayve-raises-1-billion-led-by-softbank-to-take-self-driving-to-cars-and-robots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.05 billion Series C round,</a> said last year it was evaluating a $500 million strategic investment in Wayve’s next raise. While Nvidia did participate, Kendall wouldn’t disclose the exact amount of its investment or whether it came close to that $500 million figure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated to include more information on the $300 million in additional funding from Uber. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
