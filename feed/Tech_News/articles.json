But it’s been embroiled in controversy for most of its existence.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anonymous messaging apps are problematic because they can encourage bullying among teens — Snapchat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/17/following-suicides-and-lawsuits-snapchat-restricts-apps-building-on-its-platform-with-new-policies/\">banned</a> third-party apps like NGL, LMK, Sendit, and YOLO from its platform in 2022 after a parent sued the company for its alleged role in her teenage son’s suicide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NGL also came under fire for its shady growth hacking tactics, like sending fake messages to users that seemed like they were from real people but were actually automated by the app. Some users were tricked into paying a $9.99 monthly subscription to get hints about who sent the messages, which were fake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a two-year investigation, the FTC <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/09/ftc-bans-ngl-from-offering-its-anonymous-social-app-to-minors/\">announced</a> in 2024 that it would ban NGL from offering its app to minors — one of its most drastic interventions to protect minors from harmful social media experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“NGL’s bait-and-switch tactic prompted many consumers to complain, which NGL executives laughed off, dismissing such users as ‘suckers’,” the FTC said in a statement at the time. NGL paid a $5 million fine to the FTC and complied with its demands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NGL’s two founders, Raj Vir and João Figueiredo, are moving on from the app, according to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anonymous-messaging-app-ngl-has-been-acquired-by-mode-mobile-2025-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Business Insider</a>.

According to the company’s <a href=\"https://invest.modemobile.com/?tnames=modehome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investor materials</a>, Mode Mobile generates revenue from “digital advertising partners” that “pay for user attention and engagement.” Basically, your phone is constantly flooded with ads, but you might make enough money to buy a round of beers at a dive bar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The terms of the sale were not disclosed.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, security researchers say there are hundreds of Cisco customers who could potentially be hacked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Piotr Kijewski, the chief executive of the nonprofit Shadowserver Foundation that scans and monitors the internet for hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that the scale of exposure “seems more in the hundreds rather than thousands or tens of thousands.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kijewski said the foundation was not seeing widespread activity, presumably because “current attacks are targeted.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"http://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/tree/?date_range=1&amp;source=http_vulnerable&amp;source=http_vulnerable6&amp;tag=cve-2025-20393%2B&amp;data_set=count&amp;scale=log&amp;auto_update=on\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shadowserver has a page</a> where it’s tracking the number of systems that are exposed and vulnerable to the flaw disclosed by Cisco, named officially as CVE-2025-20393. The vulnerability is known as a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day</a>, because the flaw was discovered before the company had time to make patches available. As of press time, India, Thailand, and the United States collectively have dozens of affected systems within their borders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Censys, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacking activities across the internet, is also seeing a limited number of affected Cisco customers. <a href=\"https://censys.com/advisory/cve-2025-20393\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">According to a blog post</a>, Censys has observed 220 internet-exposed Cisco email gateways, one of the products known to be vulnerable.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this hacking campaign?

Neither of those two conditions are enabled by default, per Cisco, which would explain why there appears to be, relatively speaking, not that many vulnerable systems on the internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cisco did not respond to a request for comment, asking if the company could corroborate the numbers seen by Shadowserver and Censys. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger problem with this hacking campaign is that there are no patches available. Cisco recommends that customers wipe and “restore an affected appliance to a secure state,” as a way to remediate any breach. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“​​In case of confirmed compromise, rebuilding the appliances is, currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actors persistence mechanism from the appliance,” the company wrote in its advisory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Cisco’s threat intelligence arm Talos, the hacking campaign has been ongoing since “at least late November 2025.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Nabla disclosed LeBrun’s new job in a <a href=\"https://www.nabla.com/press-release/nabla-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-advanced-machine-intelligence-to-pioneer-the-next-era-of-agentic-healthcare-ai#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a> and LeCun confirmed it in a brief post on LinkedIn.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Yes, AMI Labs is my new startup. I’m the Executive Chairman. And Alex LeBrun is transitioning from CEO of Nabla to CEO of AMI Labs!” LeCun <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7407558824187867136/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AMI Labs is also reportedly seeking to raise €500 million (about $586 million) at a €3 billion valuation (about $3.5 billion) right out of the gate, before even launching, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d88729c0-c44f-4530-b888-bafa29ee0446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Financial Times reported</a>, citing people familiar with the dealmaking. Given the kind of money that VCs are throwing at AI startups founded by world-recognized AI scientists these days, that’s not even an comparatively outrageous ask.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was valued at $12 billion for its seed round</a> last year. And Murati doesn’t have the same kind of street cred as LeCun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeCun, a professor at New York University who was formerly VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta, <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lecun_6017366.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">won the prestigious A.M. Turing Award</a>, for his work on reinforcement learning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The press release also confirms what everyone knew as well: that AMI Labs is working on world model AI. This is an alternative to LLMs where the AI attempts to understand its environment (aka the world) so it can simulate cause-and-effect and what-if scenarios to predict outcomes. World model creators believe it’s the answer to LLMs’ structural hallucination problems. LLMs can’t be trusted to never fabricate info because it is their very nature to be “non-deterministic” — that is, creative.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Top labs and startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/deepmind-thinks-genie-3-world-model-presents-stepping-stone-towards-agi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google DeepMind</a> and Fei-Fei Li’s startup, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">World Labs</a>, are also developing world models. By that comparison, the fundraising aspirations of AMI might appear a bit more audacious. When World Labs debuted, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-comes-out-of-stealth-with-230m-in-funding/\">Li raised $230 million at a $1 billion valuation</a> right out of the gate, which was considered a lot at the time. But that was way back in August 2024, or about 100 AI years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Nabla says the company will be searching for a new CEO and will be, for now, run by its co-founder and COO, Delphine Groll, who has not been handed the reins permanently yet. Nabla also says it has signed a partnership to use AMI’s models as they are developed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nabla has raised $120 million in total from an all-star list of backers, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nabla-raises-70m-series-c-to-deliver-agentic-ai-to-the-heart-of-clinical-workflows-bringing-total-funding-to-120m-302483646.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">including a $70 million Series C in June</a>. LeCun is one of Nabla’s investors, as is Tony Fadell’s Build Collective, HV Capital, Highland Europe, and Cathay Innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nabla’s LeBrun could be a good choice for CEO. He’s been building multimodal AI since before anyone called it that, working at Nuance Communications in the early 2010s, which originally powered Apple’s Siri in those long-ago years when Siri was wow technology. (Microsoft eventually acquired Nuance.) He founded and sold a couple of natural language startups, including one to Facebook. Then he ran Facebook’s AI division before founding Nabla in 2018, according to his LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeBrun said that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-another-24-million-for-its-ai-assistant-for-doctors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nabla, a darling of the Paris-based AI startup community</a>, is still growing well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have more than tripled our live ARR this year. Up next to $1B!” LeBrun wrote as he announced his departure as CEO. The founder says he will remain on at Nabla as chairman and chief AI scientist. Nabla declined further comment and AMI did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The streamer signed deals with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/netflix-doubles-down-on-video-podcasts-with-iheartmedia-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iHeartMedia</a> and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-dave-portnoy-barstool-sports-exclusive-video-podcasts-1236610822/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Barstool Sports</a> this week, in addition to a recent deal with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a>, to gain exclusive video rights to select shows. The company is also rumored to be in talks with <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-talks-siriusxm-exclusive-video-podcast-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SiriusXM</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Podcasters see this as an offensive move with YouTube as the primary target. And the data provides a convincing argument. According to YouTube, viewers watched over <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcasts-living-room-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">700 million hours</a> of podcasts each month on living room devices (like TVs) in 2025, up from 400 million per month last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As people begin to spend less time watching traditional television, and more time watching short form or low-cost, low-production value content on YouTube, that might present a long-term competitive threat to Netflix,” Matthew Dysart, an entertainment attorney and former head of podcast business affairs at Spotify, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While podcasters might understand the motivation, not everyone is convinced about Netflix’s move. Some podcasters told TechCrunch they’re not sure there is long-term value in video podcasts, while others are worried Netflix is contributing to a podcast bubble.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re basically saying, ‘We want to be the king of content, and the only way we’re going to do that is if we take a swipe at YouTube,’” podcaster Ronald Young Jr. told TechCrunch. Young Jr. thinks people are turning on video podcasts and letting them play in the background, noting that ESPN has been doing some version of this for much longer than we’ve been able to name it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-buzz-of-video-podcasts\">The buzz of video podcasts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When independent podcasters Mike Schubert and Sequoia Simone launched their new show <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/protalkpod/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“Professional Talkers”</a> this year, they noted the buzz around video podcasts and decided to start the new show as a video-first production on YouTube and Spotify.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Neither of us had done video before, so we were like, ‘Why don’t we just start from the beginning and make this a video show?’” Schubert told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Schubert found that his audience was ambivalent toward the video, perhaps because he has spent nearly a decade releasing audio podcasts, cultivating a fanbase that already enjoys and expects audio content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We posted an audio-only episode, and it did pretty similarly, numbers-wise,” he said. “So why would we put so much time and effort into the video and then run the risk of the episode being late when we can just do audio only?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Young Jr. considered investing more energy into video, but decided against it — like Schubert and Simone, he realized that he built an audience that prefers listening to podcasts over viewing them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m like, ‘Well who am I pivoting for?’” he said. “And I realized that the pivot would be for advertisers, for podcast executives, and for people who think that video is the direction that everyone’s going.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, there are some consumers who want to see video — even as a passive show to turn on in the background — as evidenced by YouTube’s staggering viewership stats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mikah Sargent, a podcast producer and host at <a href=\"https://twit.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TWiT.tv</a>, works with shows like “This Week in Tech,” which have had a video component for more than 15 years. <em>(Disclosure: I co-host a show at TWiT.tv once per month.)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Something that I regularly hear from our listeners is … ‘you were my background when I was going through a rough time, or I needed to travel across the country, and having you there to listen to helped me pass the time,’” Sargent told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of passed time with podcasts. So Netflix can look at that and go, ‘Ooh, we get to have this thing that in some cases takes up more time and more streaming than you would get with a typical show.’”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-a-podcast-anyway\">What is a podcast anyway?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a disconnect between how creators and tech companies each think about podcasts. For people who make podcasts, a podcast can be a conversational show like the ones on YouTube, but it can also be a format that doesn’t translate seamlessly to video, like scripted fiction with sound design and voice actors, or the kind of reported, refined audio stories you’d find on NPR. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think this has to do with how squishy the word podcast is now,” podcaster Eric Silver told TechCrunch. “It means anything. It just means show now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For these independent creators, the corporate goings-on between Netflix and Spotify don’t immediately impact their day-to-day. But podcasters remember what happened when Spotify bought up and consolidated a significant chunk of the industry, created a bubble, then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/spotify-layoffs-podcast-industry-fallout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">burst that same bubble itself</a>. The impact reverberated across the industry with <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/spotify-layoffs-the-ringer-podcast-studios-1236420307/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">studio closures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/business/spotify-layoffs-gimlet-podcasts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">layoffs</a>, and a conception among onlookers that podcasting was “dead.” So when another Big Tech company comes waltzing into their industry, they’re skeptical. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In any form of entertainment and media, when companies consolidate, the people who currently have power continue to get richer and richer than the industry underneath it,” Silver said. “The future gets more and more murky, and has less and less resources.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix isn’t making as extreme moves as Spotify. The latter company spent billions acquiring several tech startups and studios, allowing Spotify to control the entire process of making a podcast, from the recording software to the ad sales tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that what Netflix is doing is a little bit more calculated than what Spotify did,” Young Jr. said. “Spotify blindly threw money at the top creators, and they kind of cratered the market in doing so, because the minute you value Joe Rogan at $250 million … you value them so highly that the regular podcaster is like, where do I fall on this?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s seen as an industry-changing infusion of money into the podcast industry isn’t actually that staggering for a company like Netflix, which is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-earnings-top-estimates-but-stock-slips-on-elevated-expectations-133606430.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">on track</a> to make about $45 billion this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Netflix and Spotify are similar in that way — aggressive moves to test a new value proposition by targeting top performers and spending money that ultimately is not that substantial from the perspective of a global tech platform, but is meaningful to the creator economy, to quickly learn if there’s a ‘there’ there,” Dysart said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix has only made deals with media companies thus far, rather than individual creators like Spotify did, but Dysart thinks Netflix’s investments are only beginning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I would expect Netflix to at some point go try to strike a nine-figure deal with a top podcast creator,” he added.  “I would also expect Netflix to take really big swings with very high-profile personalities on original podcasts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Netflix gets its way, our culture will shift away from watching programmatic daytime TV and talk shows and toward watching podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Back in the day, my mom would have a soap opera playing in the background while she was doing things, and I was definitely the person who would have ‘The Office’ playing in the background while I’m doing things,” Sargent said. “Now people get to have a podcast playing in the background while they’re doing things, and if Netflix can be the place where they go to do that, then I think it’s a win for the company.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Still, questions remain about how consistently such policies will translate into practice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updates come as the AI industry generally, and OpenAI in particular, faces increased <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/ftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others/\">scrutiny from policymakers</a>, educators, and child-safety advocates after several teenagers allegedly died by suicide after prolonged conversations with AI chatbots. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gen Z, which includes those born between 1997 and 2012, are the <a href=\"https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employee-engagement/gen-zs-connect-more-with-chatgpt-than-colleagues/553325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most active users of OpenAI’s chatbot</a>. And following <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/disneys-openai-deal-is-exclusive-for-just-one-year-then-its-open-season/\">OpenAI’s recent deal with Disney</a>, more young people may flock to the platform, which lets you do everything from ask for help with homework to generate images and videos on thousands of topics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-and-bipartisan-coalition-urge-big-tech-companies-address\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">42 state attorneys general signed a letter</a> to Big Tech companies, urging them to implement safeguards on AI chatbots to protect children and vulnerable people. And as the Trump administration works out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/trumps-ai-executive-order-promises-one-rulebook-startups-may-get-legal-limbo-instead/\">what the federal standard on AI regulation</a> might look like, policymakers like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) have introduced <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/3062/text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legislation</a> that would ban minors from interacting with AI chatbots altogether. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s updated <a href=\"https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-12-18.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Model Spec</a>, which lays out behavior guidelines for its large language models, builds on existing specifications that prohibit the models from generating sexual content involving minors, or encouraging self-harm, delusions, or mania. This would work together with an upcoming age-prediction model that would identify when an account belongs to a minor and automatically roll out teen safeguards. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compared with adult users, the models are subject to stricter rules when a teenager is using them. Models are instructed to avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and first-person sexual or violent roleplay, even when it’s non-graphic. The specification also calls for extra caution around subjects like body image and disordered eating behaviors, and instructs the models to prioritize communicating about safety over autonomy when harm is involved and avoid advice that would help teens conceal unsafe behavior from caregivers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI specifies that these limits should hold even when prompts are framed as “fictional, hypothetical, historical, or educational” — common tactics that rely on role-play or edge-case scenarios in order to get an AI model to deviate from its guidelines. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-actions-speak-louder-than-words\"><strong>Actions speak louder than words</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077807\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png 1934w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=768,539 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=1200,843 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=1280,899 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=430,302 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=720,506 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=900,632 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=800,562 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=1536,1079 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=668,469 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=534,375 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=879,617 879w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=708,497 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">OpenAI’s model behavior guidelines prohibit first-person romantic role-playing with teens.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says the key safety practices for teens are underpinned by four principles that guide the models’ approach: </p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Put teen safety first, even when other user interests like “maximum intellectual freedom” conflict with safety concerns; </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Promote real-world support by guiding teens towards family, friends, and local professionals for well-being; </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Treat teens like teens by speaking with warmth and respect, not condescension or treating them like adults; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Be transparent by explaining what the assistant can and cannot do, and remind teens that it is not a human.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document also shares several examples of the chatbot explaining why it can’t “roleplay as your girlfriend” or “help with extreme appearance changes or risky shortcuts.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lily Li, a privacy and AI lawyer and founder of Metaverse Law, said it was encouraging to see OpenAI take steps to have its chatbot decline to engage in such behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Explaining that one of the biggest complaints advocates and parents have about chatbots is that they relentlessly promote ongoing engagement in a way that can be addictive for teens, she said: “I am very happy to see OpenAI say, in some of these responses, we can’t answer your question. The more we see that, I think that would break the cycle that would lead to a lot of inappropriate conduct or self-harm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, examples are just that: cherry-picked instances of how OpenAI’s safety team would like the models to behave. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">Sycophancy</a>, or an AI chatbot’s tendency to be overly agreeable with the user, has been listed as a prohibited behavior in previous versions of the Model Spec, but ChatGPT still engaged in that behavior anyway. That was particularly true with GPT-4o, a model that has been associated with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">several instances of what experts are calling “AI psychosis.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting kids in the digital world, raised concerns about potential conflicts within the Model Spec’s under-18 guidelines. He highlighted tensions between safety-focused provisions and the “no topic is off limits” principle, which directs models to address any topic regardless of sensitivity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have to understand how the different parts of the spec fit together,” he said, noting that certain sections may push systems toward engagement over safety. His organization’s testing revealed that ChatGPT often mirrors users’ energy, sometimes resulting in responses that aren’t contextually appropriate or aligned with user safety, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Adam Raine, a teenager who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\">died by suicide after months of dialogue</a> with ChatGPT, the chatbot engaged in such mirroring, their conversations show. That case also brought to light how OpenAI’s moderation API failed to prevent unsafe and harmful interactions despite flagging more than 1,000 instances of ChatGPT mentioning suicide and 377 messages containing self-harm content. But that wasn’t enough to stop Adam from continuing his conversations with ChatGPT. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an interview with TechCrunch in September, former OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler said this was because, historically, OpenAI had run classifiers (the automated systems that label and flag content) in bulk after the fact, not in real time, so they didn’t properly gate the user’s interaction with ChatGPT. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI now uses automated classifiers to assess text, image, and audio content in real time, according to the firm’s <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12315553-parental-controls-on-chatgpt-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">updated parental controls</a> document. The systems are designed to detect and block content related to child sexual abuse material, filter sensitive topics, and identify self-harm. If the system flags a prompt that suggests a serious safety concern, a small team of trained people will review the flagged content to determine if there are signs of “acute distress,” and may notify a parent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Torney applauded OpenAI’s recent steps toward safety, including its transparency in publishing guidelines for users under 18 years old. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not all companies are publishing their policy guidelines in the same way,” Torney said, pointing to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/leaked-meta-ai-rules-show-chatbots-were-allowed-to-have-romantic-chats-with-kids/https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/leaked-meta-ai-rules-show-chatbots-were-allowed-to-have-romantic-chats-with-kids/\">Meta’s leaked guidelines</a>, which showed that the firm let its chatbots engage in sensual and romantic conversations with children. “This is an example of the type of transparency that can support safety researchers and the general public in understanding how these models actually function and how they’re supposed to function.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, though, it is the actual behavior of an AI system that matters, Adler told TechCrunch on Thursday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I appreciate OpenAI being thoughtful about intended behavior, but unless the company measures the actual behaviors, intentions are ultimately just words,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Put differently: What’s missing from this announcement is evidence that ChatGPT actually follows the guidelines set out in the Model Spec. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-paradigm-shift\"><strong>A paradigm shift</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077806\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png 1950w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=300,281 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=768,718 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=680,636 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=1200,1122 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=1280,1197 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=430,402 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=720,673 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=900,842 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=800,748 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=1536,1437 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=668,625 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=401,375 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=660,617 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=568,531 568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">OpenAI’s Model Spec guides ChatGPT to steer conversations away from encouraging poor self-image.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Experts say with these guidelines, OpenAI appears poised to get ahead of certain legislation, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/\">California’s SB 243</a>, a recently signed bill regulating AI companion chatbots that goes into effect in 2027. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model Spec’s new language language mirrors some of the law’s main requirements around prohibiting chatbots from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill also requires platforms to provide alerts every three hours to minors reminding them they are speaking to a chatbot, not a real person, and they should take a break. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked how often ChatGPT would remind teens that they’re talking to a chatbot and ask them to take a break, an OpenAI spokesperson did not share details, saying only that the company trains its models to represent themselves as AI and remind users of that, and that it implements break reminders during “long sessions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also shared two new <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/a-family-guide-to-help-teens-use-ai-responsibly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI literacy resources</a> for parents and families. The <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/tips-for-talking-to-your-teen-about-ai.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tips</a> include conversation starters and guidance to help parents talk to teens about what AI can and can’t do, build critical thinking, set healthy boundaries, and navigate sensitive topics. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taken together, the documents formalize an approach that shares responsibility with caretakers: OpenAI spells out what the models should do, and offers families a framework for supervising how it’s used. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The focus on parental responsibility is notable because it mirrors Silicon Valley talking points. In its <a href=\"https://a16z.com/a-roadmap-for-federal-ai-legislation-protect-people-empower-builders-win-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recommendations for federal AI regulation</a> posted this week, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz suggested more disclosure requirements for child safety, rather than restrictive requirements, and weighted the onus more toward parental responsibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several of OpenAI’s principles — safety-first when values conflict; nudging users toward real-world support; reinforcing that the chatbot isn’t a person — are being articulated as teen guardrails. But <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">several adults have died by suicide and suffered life-threatening delusions</a>, which invites an obvious follow-up: Should those defaults apply across the board, or does OpenAI see them as trade-offs it’s only willing to enforce when minors are involved?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An OpenAI spokesperson countered that the firm’s safety approach is designed to protect all users, saying the Model Spec is just one component of a multi-layered strategy.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li says it has been a “bit of a wild west” so far regarding the legal requirements and tech companies’ intentions. But she feels laws like SB 243, which requires tech companies to disclose their safeguards publicly, will change the paradigm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The legal risks will show up now for companies if they advertise that they have these safeguards and mechanisms in place on their website, but then don’t follow through with incorporating these safeguards,” Li said. “Because then, from a plaintiff’s point of view, you’re not just looking at the standard litigation or legal complaints; you’re also looking at potential unfair, deceptive advertising complaints.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

What they discovered: People loved to talk, and that increased the length of the onboarding session with the app clocking 26 minutes on average. That is how San Francisco-based dating startup Known was born. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our take is that for the first time, we could know enough about somebody to serve them a date that would make sense. And if we could do that much faster with less rejection rate, we could create a user experience that could get people out on more dates,” she said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077686\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg 2052w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Introductions.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Known</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And early results suggested they were on to something. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its test phase in San Francisco, Known said it observed 80% of its introductions led to in-person dates, which is much higher than swipe-based dating apps. Buoyed by these signals, the startup has raised $9.7 million from investors, including Forerunner and NFX, along with Pear VC and Coelius Capital. Notably, this is the first dating app investment for Forerunner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Celeste is a really thoughtful founder who understands the mindset of the consumer, which is a young female, to be honest. There are other people who can be focused on the male demographic, but she is focused on the young female who has a lot of unspoken desires and needs that, if you put them in a profile, they would never say, this versus that. And I think in a conversation, you can get a lot of those nuances out, but in the past, the conversation required a $10,000 matchmaker,” Eurie Kim, a partner at Forerunner, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amadon said she has always been very interested in social impact at scale and thinks dating is inherently one of the biggest problems facing her generation. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’ve been a million pieces written about the loneliness epidemic in the U.S. And I do really think that it’s our generation’s largest problem,” said Amadon, who, along with Allen, dropped out of Stanford to build the startup. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077687\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg 2052w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Known</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app, which is being testedin San Francisco in beta, uses voice AI-powered onboarding to ask several questions to users without having them fill out any forms. Amadon said because of this modality, the startup is able to know more about users and provide them with great matches, with one user’s onboarding clocking in at an hour and 38 minutes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Known, when people typed their responses out, they would edit them. With voice, the onboarding is more personable. The company’s AI can ask dynamic follow-ups based on the conversation. For instance, if someone has newly moved to the city, the AI can ask them what they like and dislike about their experience thus far.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once the onboarding is complete, the AI suggests potential matches to users. They can ask AI agents about those profiles. If they like a profile, they can tap on “interested.” When two people are matched, they have 24 hours to accept the introduction and 24 hours to agree to a date. The company said that with this mechanism, the app aims to avoid lingering chats and ghosting while encouraging people to meet in real life. After their dates, users can provide their feedback to the AI and get more refined recommendations for matches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Known hasn’t completely ditched the restaurant idea. The app also helps in picking restaurants based on user likes and dislikes. Using the AI chat and calendar integrations, users can also indicate their availability for the first dates. In the beta phase, the company charged $30 per successful date. However, the startup is not set on the price and said it will experiment with different models to find out what payment modality works the best.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077688\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg 2052w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Known</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today the startup has three full-time engineers and four people working on go-to-market, with several contractors working in all areas.

(The company recently said the <a href=\"https://mobilegamer.biz/netflix-games-ditches-top-performer-gta-san-andreas-as-reboot-continues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GTA game was on its way out</a>, too, alongside dozens of other titles.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix <a href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-shutters-squid-game-unleashed-developer-boss-fight-entertainment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/stranger-things-game-developer-bonusxp-shut-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shut</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-shuts-down-game-studio-behind-squid-game-unleashed-2025-10-24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">down</a> <a href=\"https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.animationmagazine.net/2024/10/netflix-shuts-down-aaa-video-game-studio-before-first-release/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">of</a> its studio acquisitions or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-is-getting-rid-of-another-of-its-game-studios-by-selling-it-back-to-its-founders-203645232.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">returned them to their founders</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To some extent, these changes could have been anticipated.

It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Naver’s capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton’s $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Krafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content, and fintech spaces.

Legal experts say that DOGE staffers are “personally liable” under U.S. hacking laws, though a court would also have to agree.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s subsequent, very public falling out with President Trump saw the billionaire leave DOGE, and left staffers fearing that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/doge-days-are-over-as-trump-disbands-elon-musks-team-of-federal-cost-cutters/\">they could face federal charges</a> without his protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In late September, senior executives at American corporate giants <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/dozens-of-organizations-had-data-stolen-in-oracle-linked-hacks/\">began receiving threatening emails</a> from a prolific ransomware and extortion group called Clop. The emails included an attached copy of their personal information — and a ransom demand for several million dollars not to publish it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Months earlier, the Clop gang had quietly exploited a never-before-seen vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business software, a suite of applications used for hosting a company’s core business information, such as financial and human resources records, supply chain data, and customer databases. The vulnerability allowed Clop to steal reams of sensitive employee data, including data belonging to executives, from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/dozens-of-organizations-had-data-stolen-in-oracle-linked-hacks/\">dozens of organizations</a> that rely on Oracle’s software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oracle had no idea until it was caught out in October as it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/clop-hackers-caught-exploiting-oracle-zero-day-bug-to-steal-executives-personal-data/\">scrambling to patch the vulnerability</a>. It was too late, though: The hackers had already stolen gobs of data from <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/university-pennsylvania-oracle-e-business-suite-clop-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">universities</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/news/cl0p-cyberattack-update-18178/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hospitals and health systems</a>, <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/washington-post-oracle-clop-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">media organizations</a>, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was Clop’s most recent mass-hacking campaign. The group had previously exploited flaws in enterprise file-transfer services, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/fortra-goanywhere-clop-ransomware/\">GoAnywhere</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/microsoft-clop-moveit-hacks-victims/\">MOVEit</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/24/clop-ransomware-gang-takes-credit-for-latest-mass-hack-that-breached-dozens-of-companies/\">Cleo Software</a>, which tech giants use to share large amounts of information over the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce customers had a rough year after two separate data breaches at downstream tech companies allowed hackers to steal a billion records of customer data stored in Salesforce’s cloud. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers targeted at least two companies, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/salesloft-says-drift-customer-data-thefts-linked-to-march-github-account-hack/\">Salesloft</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/google-says-hackers-stole-data-from-200-companies-following-gainsight-breach/\">Gainsight</a>, both of which allow their customers to handle and analyze the data that they store in Salesforce. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By breaching these companies directly, the hackers gained access to all of the data through their customer connections to Salesforce. Some of the largest tech giants had data stolen in the breaches, including Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Docusign, GitLab, LinkedIn, SonicWall, and Verizon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, made up of members from different hacking groups, including ShinyHunters, published a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/hacking-group-claims-theft-of-1-billion-records-from-salesforce-customer-databases/\">data leak site advertising the stolen records</a> in exchange for a ransom paid by the victims. New victims are still rolling in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers tore through the U.K. retail sector earlier this year, stealing data from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/marks-spencer-confirms-customers-personal-data-was-stolen-in-hack/\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> and at least <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/uk-retail-giant-co-op-confirms-hackers-stole-all-6-5-million-customer-records/\">6.5 million customer records from the Co-op</a>. The back-to-back hacks sparked outages and disruption across the retailers’ networks, and some grocery shelves went empty as the systems used to support the retailers were knocked out. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq5w324pd3o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Luxury store Harrods</a> was also later hacked.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"BIRMINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM - SEPTEMBER 30: An aerial view of JLR signage at the Jaguar Land Rover vehicle manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich on September 30, 2025 in Birmingham, United Kingdom.\" class=\"wp-image-3077707\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg 1995w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=680,489 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=1200,863 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=1280,920 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=430,309 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=720,518 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=900,647 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=800,575 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=1536,1104 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=668,480 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=522,375 522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=858,617 858w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=708,509 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">An aerial view of JLR signage at the Jaguar Land Rover vehicle manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich on September 30, 2025 in Birmingham, United Kingdom, following its hack and data breach.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Christopher Furlong / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a major cyberattack targeting Jaguar Land Rover, one of the country’s biggest employers, left a dent in the U.K. economy. A September <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-data-stolen-in-disruptive-cyberattack/\">hack and data breach</a> saw JLR’s car plant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/jaguar-land-rover-to-pause-production-for-third-week-due-to-cyberattack/\">stall production for months</a> as the company worked to get its systems back up and running. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fallout affected JLR’s suppliers across the U.K., some of whom went out of business altogether. The U.K. government ended up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/uk-government-bails-out-jaguar-land-rover-with-1-5b-loan-after-hack-disrupts-vehicle-production-for-weeks/\">guaranteeing a bailout to the tune of £1.5 billion</a> to ensure Jaguar Land Rover employees and suppliers got paid during the shutdown. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.K. security experts said the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9pdld4y81o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">breach was the most economically damaging cyberattack</a> to hit the United Kingdom in history, showing that disruption may be more valuable for financially motivated hackers than stolen data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea experienced a major data breach every month this year, and the personal data of millions of its citizens was compromised thanks to security lapses and shoddy data practices at the country’s biggest tech and phone providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The country’s largest phone company, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/a-timeline-of-south-korean-telco-giant-skts-data-breach/\">SK Telecom, was hacked and 23 million customer records</a> were exposed; several cyberattacks were attributed to its hostile North Korean neighbor; and a <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/question-of-the-day/how-much-government-data-was-lost-in-a-data-center-fire-in-south-korea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">massive data center fire</a> wiped out years of Korean government data that wasn’t backed up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the cherry on the data breach cake was the months-long theft of some 33 million customers’ personal information from Coupang, the country’s retail giant that some call Asia’s Amazon. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/koreas-coupang-says-data-breach-exposed-nearly-34m-customers-personal-information/\">data theft began in June</a>, but wasn’t detected until November, and ultimately led to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/ceo-of-south-korean-retail-giant-coupang-resigns-after-massive-data-breach/\">company’s chief executive</a> resigning.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok has reached a deal to cede a substantial portion of its U.S. operation to a group of American investors, thus ending a years-long tussle in which the federal government has sought to force the platform to do just that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new partnership is described as a “new TikTok U.S. joint venture” in an internal memo from ByteDance CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That arrangement will see major American investors take over significant control of the U.S.-based business. The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">originally reported by Axios</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/trump-signs-executive-order-approving-tiktok-deal/\">an executive order</a> signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/oracle-silver-lake-mgx-tiktok.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported</a> that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/september-19?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">except to say that</a> it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok’s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">national security concerns</a> as the rationale.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/apple-opens-up-its-app-store-to-competition-in-japan/\">Japan</a>, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/apple-loses-appeals-court-ruling-in-app-store-fight-with-epic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">federal appeals court earlier this month</a> ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new developer agreement</a>, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will <a href=\"https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/apple-eu-dma-update-june-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">transition from the CTF to a new fee</a>, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=76371du6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introducing</a> sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s “free delivery” claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/12/instacart-pay-60-million-consumer-refunds-settle-ftc-lawsuit-over-allegations-it-engaged-deceptive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a statement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instacart acknowledged the settlement in a <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/how-instacart-goes-above-and-beyond-for-customers-simplicity-transparency-and-billions-in-savings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The settlement comes as Instacart is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/study-shows-instacart-may-be-charging-some-shoppers-20-more-for-the-same-product/\">currently under fire</a> over a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/money/questionable-business-practices/instacart-ai-pricing-experiment-inflating-grocery-bills-a1142182490/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent study</a> that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores.

Several companies in 9yards’ portfolio have gone public since then — including Robinhood, Toast, and Coinbase. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-his-new-role-at-openai\">What’s his new role at OpenAI?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Osborne <a href=\"https://x.com/George_Osborne/status/2000982429247365479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on X that he was joining OpenAI “as managing director and head of OpenAI for [C]ountries, based here in London.” He will help expand existing partnerships and build new ones, OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-lehane-2562535_ive-spent-enough-time-in-government-to-know-activity-7406755715211628546-NpvR/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Introduced in May 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/openai-wants-to-team-up-with-governments-to-grow-ai-infrastructure/\">OpenAI for Countries</a> is an initiative through which the AI company partners with governments looking to build in-country data center capacity and localize ChatGPT for their language and culture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI for Countries is an extension of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">Stargate project</a>, a $500 billion initiative through which OpenAI is currently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">building five new data centers</a> across the U.S. with Oracle and SoftBank. But beyond infrastructure, its stated goal is to “support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/ten-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turns 10</a>, it is only natural that it starts hiring the kind of talent that won’t get <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/y-combinator-sam-altman-kicked-out-of-the-ritz-for-violating-dress-code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turned down at the Ritz for wearing sport shoes</a>. An Oxford graduate and the son of a baronet, Osborne fits the bill — but his network and reach are even more valuable, and his podcast with former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls, called “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@polcurrency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Political Currency</a>,” underscores his extensive political connections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His track record and contacts could be even more directly relevant for Coinbase, which he was already advising and where he will now “play a much more active role in helping us with policymakers around the world,” the company’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/coinbase-appoints-uk-ex-finance-minister-george-osborne-run-advisory-council-2025-12-18/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Staying on the right side of regulators is particularly important for crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which has been making efforts to influence governments in the U.S. and beyond. But this is also critical for OpenAI, which intends to weigh in as AI gains a foothold in governments’ agendas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Lehane’s LinkedIn post, Osborne’s decision to take the role “reflects a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure — and early decisions about how it’s built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pattern-to-watch\">The pattern to watch</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Osborne’s latest role immediately drew parallels with other high-profile British politicians who went on to join major U.S. tech companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These include former U.K. deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who served as Meta’s policy chief <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/02/meta-policy-chief-nick-clegg-steps-down/\">for over six years</a>, and, more recently, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak taking on advisory roles <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqe22pz81o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with Microsoft and AI firm Anthropic</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This trend raises different concerns depending on your perspective. Some critics worry about active Members of Parliament like Sunak potentially advocating for U.S. corporate interests while still serving in government. Others take issue with former officials like Osborne leveraging their government experience and connections to secure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/15/george-osborne-investment-management-lingotto-agnelli-exor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">highly lucrative</a> private sector positions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “revolving door” phenomenon between government and the private sector <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">isn’t new</a>. But the practice has attracted heightened scrutiny in Europe, especially when controversial foreign companies — whether tech firms or retailers<a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2025/06/11/macron-defends-former-minister-now-lobbying-for-shein_6742246_5.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> like Shein</a> — hire former <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/11/05/shein-why-french-authorities-struggle-to-regulate-fast-fashion-giant_6747133_7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">government officials</a> to help navigate regulations and influence policy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seen from the other side, this is simply a matter of leveraging skills and experience. In his bio on 9yards’ team page, the VC firm touts that “George devised many regulations that positioned the U.K. as a global fintech leader, including the open banking regime and the FCA ‘sandbox.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others, however, view Osborne’s career moves more critically. They point to his controversial austerity policies as chancellor, and note that he has a history of ethics concerns around the revolving door. For example, when he took the Evening Standard editor job in 2017, he failed to seek approval from the government’s ethics watchdog first — a move that led to the body being criticized as “toothless.” His attitude at the time was telling: “At the age of 45, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor,” Osborne declared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, that mindset — transitioning quickly from public service to high-paying private roles — is precisely what makes his OpenAI and Coinbase appointments part of a broader pattern that concerns ethics watchdogs today.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

India is emerging as the fastest-growing market for profile verification, highlighting the country’s expanding influence on how digital work networks operate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn members are adding around 30 million verifications to their profiles each year, with adoption up more than 38% year-over-year in 2025, according to Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn’s vice president of trust products. The increase follows the company’s announcement last week that <a href=\"https://news.linkedin.com/2025/verified--linkedin-crosses-100m-member-milestone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 100 million users</a> have added at least one verification.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-linkedin-profile-features-help-verify-identity-detect-rodriguez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">began rolling out</a> profile verification to provide clearer signals of authenticity on the platform. It initially focused on confirming members’ workplace or identity, including through company email addresses, before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/linkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expanding to government-issued ID checks</a>, and has since been extended to company pages and job listings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most LinkedIn members who have added a verification to their profile have done so by confirming their association with a workplace, typically using a company email address or similar credentials, rather than verifying their personal identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">About 60% of verified members have confirmed a workplace affiliation, typically using a company email address, while roughly 27% have verified their identity using a government-issued ID, Rodriguez said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pace-of-india-growth\">The pace of India growth</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Geographically, the U.S. accounts for the largest share of verified users, representing about 40% of the more than 100 million members who have added at least one verification, the company said. India follows closely, alongside other major markets, including the U.K., Canada, Brazil, and France.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the U.S. continues to account for the largest overall share of verified users, India has emerged as LinkedIn’s fastest-growing market for profile verification, Rodriguez said, with adoption rising about 80% over the past 12 months.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is already one of LinkedIn’s largest and fastest-growing user markets globally, with <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology-india-emerges-as-linkedins-fastest-growing-market-with-16-crore-users-3969636/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 160 million users</a>, and the pace of verification adoption there is unfolding alongside broader growth in professional networking, hiring, and remote work on the platform. This underscores how shifts in India’s workforce are increasingly shaping LinkedIn’s global usage patterns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As verification adoption has grown, LinkedIn has also begun extending those signals beyond its own platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, the Microsoft-owned company launched its “Verified on LinkedIn” program, allowing partner platforms to display LinkedIn verification badges. Zoom is the most recent partner for this move, joining companies such as Adobe and G2. The company also recently introduced a self-serve API to make it easier for other organizations to integrate verification into their own services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LinkedIn says profile verification is associated with higher engagement on the platform, with verified members seeing up to 60% more profile views and around 50% more interaction on their posts compared with unverified users. Verified company pages also tend to attract more attention, recording significantly higher views and follower growth, the company stated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Verifications provide a powerful signal of authenticity on LinkedIn, helping to support authenticity and trust,” said Rodriguez. “Members with verifications are far more likely to represent real people, and jobs with verifications of the page, and hirer maintain significantly higher integrity and safety standards.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
