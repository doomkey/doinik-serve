For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/salesforce-acquires-informatica-for-8-billion/\">data management company Informatica</a> last May.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Net income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/anshublog/status/2018762793978413111\">Salesforce as their poster child,</a> have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seat <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/mcuban/status/2026690613014298881\">business models obsolete</a>. The situation has been dubbed the “Saaspocalypse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also revamped the earnings call itself. It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&amp;A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja, the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: they all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: Agentic Work Units (“AWU”). The idea here is that rather than simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task, like writing to a record, rather than just generating text. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but really <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.saastr.com/the-real-data-on-ai-agents-what-1-trillion-tokens-a-day-reveals-with-openrouters-coo/\">is not</a> in the AI world.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce President and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable task.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itself <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Benioff/status/2026803953342755116/photo/3\">owning most of the tech stack</a>, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\">OpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier,</a> platform. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2019413714341097945\">on the bottom as the unseen engines</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round values Gushwork at $33 million post-money, up from about $7.5 million following its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/gushwork-ai-funding-lightspeed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lightspeed-led $2.1 million pre-seed</a> in July 2023, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The latest financing brings Gushwork’s total funding to $11 million, the startup said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding comes as AI companies, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-its-google-challenger-chatgpt-search/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/perplexity-received-780-million-queries-last-month-ceo-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Perplexity</a>, begin to chip away at traditional web search, prompting incumbents like Google to roll out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-generated overviews</a> and other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/google-now-lets-users-jump-from-ai-overviews-into-ai-mode-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conversational features</a> across their search products. Gushwork is betting this shift will create a new opportunity to help businesses surface in AI-driven discovery channels using its automated marketing agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2023 by Nayrhit Bhattacharya (pictured above, right) and Adithya Venkatesh (pictured above, left), Gushwork initially focused on helping small and medium businesses outsource workflows using a mix of AI and human expertise. The startup began narrowing its focus toward search-led marketing after seeing strong customer demand for help with improving online visibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started, we were focused on helping businesses outsource faster and outsource better,” Bhattacharya told TechCrunch in an interview, adding that the pull around search from customers became increasingly hard to ignore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s platform uses a network of AI agents to automatically generate and update search-optimized content; build backlinks — typically 10 to 20 per customer — through a network of roughly 200 to 300 partner websites; and track inbound leads through an integrated content management system. The goal, Bhattacharya said, is to help businesses surface in both traditional search results and AI-generated answers without relying on large in-house marketing teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says it has signed up more than 300 paying customers — roughly 95% of them in the U.S. — with subscriptions starting at $800 per month. Gushwork is currently running at about $1.5 million in annualized recurring revenue after rolling out its AI search-focused product around three months ago and is targeting $3 million to $3.5 million ARR in the next three months, Bhattacharya said, adding that the startup is growing about 50% to 80% month over month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across Gushwork’s customer base, about 20% of website traffic now comes from AI-driven search and chat platforms, but those sources account for around 40% of inbound leads, Bhattacharya said, citing the startup’s internal data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The higher-intent leads, Bhattacharya said, are already translating into business outcomes for some customers. In one case, a professional services client has closed between $200,000 and $350,000 worth of contracts after adopting the platform, he said, declining to disclose the customer’s name. He added that many users are seeing meaningful pipeline growth as AI-driven discovery gains traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s customer base today is concentrated among high-ticket B2B service providers, industrial distributors, and contract manufacturers, primarily in the U.S., Bhattacharya said. The startup’s average subscription runs about $800 to $900 per month, or roughly $9,000 to $10,000 in annual contract value, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift toward AI-driven discovery is still in its early stages but is gaining momentum. Tools such as generative AI chatbots and AI web browsers are increasingly being used by buyers to research vendors and products. OpenAI said in July 2025 that ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/chatgpt-users-send-2-5-billion-prompts-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">received about 2.5 billion prompts a day</a> globally, including roughly 330 million from U.S. users. Bhattacharya said the trend is beginning to reshape how some businesses approach online visibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork plans to use the new funding to expand its engineering team, improve model accuracy, and scale its go-to-market efforts, Bhattacharya said. He added that the startup has more than 800 businesses on its waitlist that it plans to begin onboarding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, headquartered in Delaware with an office in Bengaluru, has about 70 employees in India, along with several contractors.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The acquisition marks the latest after Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/anthropic-acquires-bun-claude-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquired coding agent engine Bun</a> in December to help scale Claude Code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vercept had created tools for more complex agentic tasks, including its product Vy, a computer-use agent in the cloud that could operate a remote Apple MacBook. Vercept is one of the many startups working on re-imagining the personal computer for the age of AI agents. As part of the deal, Anthropic is shuttering Vercept’s product on March 25.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup was a grad of Seattle’s AI-focused <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/companies\">incubato</a><a href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">r</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/companies\"> A12,</a> which spawned from the longstanding Allen Institute for AI. Vercept’s co-founders had roots with the Allen Institute, as well, and were previously researchers there. One co-founder, Matt Deitke, made news last year as one of the AI researchers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/ai-researchers-nba-stars.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">who negotiated a monster $250 million salary</a> from Meta to join its Superintelligence Lab. On Wednesday, Deitke congratulated his former colleagues <a href=\"https://x.com/mattdeitke/status/2026758221424373787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on X</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vercept was a relatively high-profile AI startup in the region. In a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vercept-joining-anthropic-kiana-ehsani-nddmf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn post</a> announcing the acquisition by Anthropic, Vercept CEO Kiana Ehsani said the startup had raised a total of $50 million. She called out A12’s Seth Bannon, a board member, as the lead investor. Vercept previously announced it had raised a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vercept_we-are-excited-to-announce-we-raised-our-activity-7335699688777531393-VrRy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$16 million seed round</a> last January.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The list of angel investors was impressive, too, and included former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, and Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2026/anthropic-acquires-vercept-in-early-exit-for-one-of-seattles-standout-ai-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GeekWire reported.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Anthropic’s announcement of the acquisition, the company named co-founders Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick as some of the team brought on to join Anthropic in the acquisition. However, not all of Vercept’s co-founders are joining the Claude maker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oren Etzioni, who has <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2025/ex-allen-institute-for-ai-scientists-form-stealthy-ai-startup-with-former-ai2-ceo-oren-etzioni/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously been named</a> as a co-founder of Vercept and investor in the startup, is well known in Seattle as the founding leader of the Allen Institute for AI. Along with Deitke, he is also not joining Anthropic, and was vocally less pleased about the acqui-hire. He posted <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432470782834008066/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on LinkedIn</a>: “After a little bit more than a year, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/vercept/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vercept</a> is throwing in the towel and giving their customers 30 days to get off the platform. Sad. A fantastic team is joining Anthropic.

He did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Etzioni’s LinkedIn post, he accused Bannon, the Vercept lead investor, of being “partly responsible” for Vercept not hiring the correct business people. A back and forth ensued between the investors, with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432495494322597888/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bannon condemning</a> Etzioni’s remarks: “… you disparaged the heroic work of the founders for achieving an outcome most could only dream of,” Bannon replied in the LinkedIn string. They also accused each other of other less savory things like lying and legal threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While public spats between investors are entertaining, and essentially meaningless, the underlying motivation is notable. The stakes are high to build the next big AI winner, and now a promising startup that raised a decently sized war chest will be tucked into Anthropic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Etzioni says he got a return on his money. Anthropic clearly wanted these researchers (perhaps — especially — with another of them at Meta).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Etzioni told GeekWire that he remains bummed. “I’m pleased to have gotten a positive return but obviously disappointed that after just a little over a year with so much traction, and such a fantastic team, we’re basically throwing in the towel,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders joining Anthropic, however, appear happy, according to CEO’s Ehsani’s LinkedIn post. “The choices were clear: we could build independently and work toward the same vision as two separate versions of it, or join forces with an incredible team and accelerate that vision into reality. The decision became an easy choice,” she said of joining Anthropic.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company reported $215 billion in revenue for the full year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As in previous quarters, the company did not report any revenue from chip exports to China, despite the recent lifting of export restrictions by the U.S. government. “While small amounts of H200 products for China-based customers were approved by the U.S. government, they have yet to generate any revenue, and we do not know whether any imports will be allowed into China,” Colette Kress, the company’s chief financial officer, said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress,” she continued, in an apparent reference to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/china-nvidia-moore-threads-trading-debut-1-billion-listing-ipo-shanghai-gpu-enflame-biren.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Moore Threads’ IPO in December</a>, “and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the investor call, Huang also addressed the company’s pending investment in OpenAI, which has been <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/nvidia-is-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-30-billion-in-openai-source-says.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported at $30 billion</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We continue to work with OpenAI toward a partnership agreement.

It’s worth noting that TikTok has also hosted awards shows in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, and Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat’s awards are more in line with TikTok’s, as it will also host a traditional awards show where the winners will be revealed live at the event. The company says the show will bring together “creators, industry leaders, and special guests.” One of the “special guests” is DJ Khaled, who will be receiving Snapchat’s “Lifetime Achievement Award.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By launching awards, Snapchat and its rivals are positioning themselves as more than just social media apps and as notable players in the entertainment industry. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Snappys will be hosted by comedian and creator Matt Friend and will take place at Snap‘s Santa Monica headquarters.

Williams sold the exploits to Operation Zero, which the U.S. government calls “one of the world’s most nefarious exploit brokers.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The successful conviction of Williams follows one of the most high-profile leaks of sensitive Western-made hacking tools in recent years. Even now that the case is over, there are still unanswered questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resided in Washington, D.C., was the general manager of Trenchant, the division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and its closest global intelligence partners. Prosecutors say <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/how-an-ex-l3-harris-trenchant-boss-stole-and-sold-cyber-exploits-to-russia/\">Williams took advantage of having “full access” to the company’s secure networks</a> to download the hacking tools onto a portable hard drive, and later to his computer. Williams contacted Operation Zero under a pseudonym though, so it’s unclear if Operation Zero ever knew Williams’ real identity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trenchant is a crew of hackers and bug hunters who dig deep into other popular software made by companies like Google and Apple, identify flaws in those millions of lines of code, then devise techniques to turn those flaws into workable exploits that can be used to reliably hack into those products. These tools are typically called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day</a> exploits because they take advantage of software flaws unknown to its developer, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/\">can be worth millions of dollars</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/\">U.S. Department of Justice alleged</a> that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed whoever used them to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the past few months, I have been talking to sources and reporting on Williams’ story before news broke that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/\">he had been arrested</a>. But what I had heard was patchwork and at times conflicting. I had heard someone had been arrested, but given the secret nature of the work involved in exploit development, proving it would be challenging.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">by email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a> \t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first heard of Williams, I wasn’t clear that I had even gotten his name right. At that point, his story was a rumor, moving through the hush-hush grapevine of zero-day exploit developers, sellers, and people with ties to the intelligence community. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I heard that maybe he was called John, or perhaps Duggan? Or all the different ways you can spell that in English. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the first rumors I heard were contradictory. Apparently he stole zero-days from Trenchant, and maybe he sold them to Russia, or perhaps another enemy of the United States and its allies, like North Korea or China? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took weeks just to confirm that there was indeed someone who even fit that description. (It turned out that Williams’ middle name is John, and Doogie is his nickname in hacker circles.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, as the weeks of reporting rolled on, things started to become much clearer. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-russian-connection\">The Russian connection</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/apple-alerts-exploit-developer-that-his-iphone-was-targeted-with-government-spyware/\">I first revealed in October</a>, Trenchant fired an employee after Williams, who was still at the time head of Trenchant, accused the employee of stealing and leaking Chrome zero-days. The story was even more intriguing because the employee told me that after he was fired, Apple notified him that someone had targeted his personal iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What I learned was just the tip of the iceberg. I had heard more from my sources, but we were still piecing parts of the story together. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after, prosecutors made their first formal accusation against a man named Peter Williams for stealing trade secrets, which first surfaced in the U.S. public court system. In that first court document, prosecutors confirmed that the buyer of these trade secrets was a buyer in Russia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there was no explicit reference to L3Harris nor Trenchant, nor the fact that the trade secrets that Williams stole were zero-days. Crucially, we still couldn’t confirm for certain that it was the same Peter Williams, who we thought would have access to highly sensitive exploits as Trenchant’s boss, and not some terrible case of mistaken identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We <em>still</em> weren’t there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a hunch and with nothing to lose, we contacted the Department of Justice to ask if they would confirm that the person in the document was in fact Peter Williams, the former boss of L3Harris Trenchant. A spokesperson confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/\">the story was out</a>. A week later, Williams pleaded guilty. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first heard of his story, while I trusted my sources, I remained skeptical. Why would someone like Williams do what the rumors claimed? But he did, and did so for money, prosecutors allege, which Williams then used to buy a house, jewelry, and luxury watches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a remarkable fall from grace for Williams, once seen as an accomplished and brilliant hacker, and especially for someone who previously worked at Australia’s top foreign spy agency and served in the country’s military. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096876\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg 4435w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">the L3Harris building in Burlington, Canada</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>JHVEPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-happened-to-the-stolen-exploits\">What happened to the stolen exploits?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We still don’t know specifically which exploits and hacking tools Williams stole and sold. Trenchant estimated a loss of $35 million, per court documents. But Williams’ lawyers said the stolen tools were not classified as a government secret.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We can glean some insight based on the circumstances of the case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that the Justice Department said the stolen tools could be used to hack “millions of computers and devices,” it’s likely the tools refer to zero-days in popular consumer software, such as Android devices, Apple’s iPhones and iPads, and web browsers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is some evidence pointing in their direction. During a hearing last year, prosecutors read out loud <a href=\"https://x.com/opzero_en/status/1706762507631677760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a post published on X</a> by Operation Zero, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/peter-williams-trenchant-trade-secrets-theft-russian-firm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to independent cybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter</a>, who attended the hearing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Due to high demand on the market, we’re increasing payouts for top-tier mobile exploits,” read the post, which specifically mentioned Android and iOS. “As always, the end user is a non-NATO country.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/russian-zero-day-seller-offers-20m-for-hacking-android-and-iphones/\">offers millions of dollars</a> for details of security vulnerabilities in Android devices and iPhones, messaging apps <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/russian-zero-day-seller-is-offering-up-to-4-million-for-telegram-exploits/\">like Telegram</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/prices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other kinds of software</a>, such as Microsoft Windows, and hardware vendors, such as several brands of servers and routers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/#:~:text=Baseband-,OUR%20CLIENTS,-Our%20clients%20are\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims</a> to work with the Russian government. At the time Williams sold the exploits to the Russian broker, Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was already underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the same day that Williams was sentenced, the U.S. Treasury <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/treasury-sanctions-russian-zero-day-broker-accused-of-buying-exploits-stolen-from-u-s-defense-contractor/\">announced it had imposed sanctions</a> against Operation Zero and its founder Sergey Zelenyuk, calling the company a national security threat. This was the government’s first confirmation that Williams had sold the exploits to Operation Zero. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its statement, the Treasury said the broker “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” At this point we don’t know who this user is. The user could be a foreign intelligence service, or it could be a ransomware gang, given that the Treasury also sanctioned Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, an alleged member of the Trickbot gang, who also allegedly worked with Operation Zero.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a court document, prosecutors said that L3Harris was able to figure out that “an unauthorized vendor was selling a component” of one of the stolen trade secrets “by comparing company-specific vendor data found on a stolen component that matched.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors also said that Williams “recognized code he wrote and sold” to Operation Zero “being utilized by a South Korean broker,” further suggesting that both L3Harris and prosecutors know which tools were stolen and sold to Operation Zero. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another unanswered question is: Did anyone, either the U.S. government or L3Harris, alert Apple, Google, or whichever tech company’s products were affected by the zero-day flaws, now that the exploits had leaked?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Any company or developer would want to know that someone could have used (or could still use) a zero-day against their users and customers so that they can patch the flaws as soon as possible. And at this point, the zero-days are of no use for L3Harris and its government customers.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I asked Apple and Google, neither company responded to my inquiries. L3Harris did not respond either. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-hacked-the-scapegoat-and-why\">Who hacked the scapegoat, and why?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s the mystery of the scapegoat, who was fired after Williams accused him of stealing and leaking code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At sentencing, Justice Department prosecutors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/\">confirmed</a> that the employee was fired, saying Williams “stood idly by while another employee of the company was essentially blamed for [his] own conduct.” In response, Williams’ attorney rebuffed prosecutors, claiming that the former employee “was fired for misconduct,” citing claims of dual-employment and improper handling of the company’s intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a court document submitted by Williams’ lawyers, as part of the L3Harris internal investigation, the company placed the employee on leave, seized his devices, transferred them to the U.S., and “offered them to the FBI.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, an unnamed FBI spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add apart from the Justice Department’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-general-manager-us-defense-contractor-sentenced-87-months-selling-stolen-trade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After being fired, that employee, whom we identified with the alias Jay Gibson, received a notification from Apple that his personal iPhone was targeted “with a mercenary spyware attack.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">sends</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/\">these</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/apple-alerted-iranians-to-iphone-spyware-attacks-say-researchers/\">notifications</a> to users it thinks were the target of attacks using tools like those made by NSO Group or Intellexa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Who tried to hack Gibson? He received the notification on March 5, 2025, more than six months after the FBI investigation had begun. The FBI “regularly interacted with [Williams] in late 2024 through the summer of 2025,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950140-usa-v-williams-24-doj-sentencing-memo/?q=october&amp;mode=document#document/p5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to a court document</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the nature of the leaked tools, it is plausible that the FBI, or perhaps even a U.S. intelligence agency, targeted Gibson as part of the investigation into Williams’ leaks. But we just don’t know, and there’s a chance that neither the public, nor Gibson, will ever find out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated to clarify 22nd paragraph attributing the tools’ lack of classification to Williams’ lawyers.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The updated ring comes equipped with a number of features, including an AI “agent coach” designed to keep users on track to attain their fitness goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS says it differentiates itself from other wearables by not just delivering health metrics but also incentivizing healthy behavior through a points system. Users garner digital “health points” for healthy behaviors — things like daily sleep, 10,000 steps every day, sports activities, and conversations with the ring’s AI coach — which can then be redeemed through an integrated marketplace for discounts on health supplements and other products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring’s AI Agent Coach, meanwhile, is designed to leverage generative AI to aid with healthy programs for exercise and daily health. The company says that its agent generates tailored programs including “daily tasks, recovery protocols, supplement recommendations, and direct referrals to licensed medical professionals.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring also tracks a host of body metrics and daily behaviors, such as sleep quality, stress management, movement, and recovery. This helps them see how these metrics affect their Pace of Aging (PoA), showing whether their body is aging faster or slower than their chronological age, the company explains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS CEO and co-founder Edison Chen told TechCrunch that since his company’s first wearable was launched in 2024, the company has sold over 30,000 units across its first two models. The app’s user base has also grown to 250,000 users across 103 countries, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our strongest markets so far have been North America, Europe, and Asia,” Chen said. “What we’re good at is pattern recognition for healthy people trying to optimize,” Chen told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AI spots when you’re trending in the wrong direction, such as chronic poor sleep, declining HRV, elevated resting heart rate, and either suggests lifestyle changes or connects you to a professional. The control is in the escalation pathway to the right care access,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims that it keeps user data encrypted and secure via the Solana blockchain. It has previously <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shop.cudis.xyz/blogs/news/smarter-rings-and-things-7-ways-to-wear-ai\">been described</a> as a “web3 AI wellness company.” (TechCrunch was not able to test the smart ring directly to verify its security claims.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS announced $5 million of seed funding in 2024. The round was led by Draper Associates and included a number of other investors, including a number of blockchain-associated investor groups like Skybridge, DraperDragon, Monke Ventures, and Foresight Ventures, among others. The company also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cudis/cudis-sporty-ring-1st-smart-ring-you-can-style-and-earn-with\">plans to launch</a> a Kickstarter soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Kalshi users can also trade on when MrBeast will get married, or when his company, Beast Industries, will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/could-mrbeast-ipo-his-ceo-wants-fans-to-have-a-chance-to-be-owners-of-the-company/\">announce an IPO</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Beast Industries spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company does not tolerate this behavior, and that this stance extends to company employees, as well as contestants on MrBeast’s Amazon Prime show “Beast Games.” Contestants are also made aware that their knowledge of confidential information precludes them from participating in related prediction markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With regard to this particular matter, we’ve already initiated an independent investigation as part of our overall ongoing efforts to ensure the integrity of our workplace and trust with our global audiences,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We welcome Kalshi — and hopefully others in the space — also taking this issue seriously, but it only works if they are willing to communicate their findings, so we’re hopeful they’ll be more open to that in the future.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi says that Kaptur traded around $4,000 on YouTube streaming markets in August and September 2025. He made a $5,397.58 profit, prompting Kalshi to fine him for that amount, plus a $15,000 penalty. Kalshi also banned Kaptur for two years. The company said in its <a href=\"https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-trading-violation-enforcement-cases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> that it will donate the fine to a consumer education nonprofit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi also fined <a href=\"https://kalshi-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/regulatory/notices/Notice%20of%20Disciplinary%20Action%20(2.25.2026)%20(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kyle Langford</a>, a candidate for political office in California, who traded about $200 on his own candidacy, then posted about it on social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The markets on platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket are so vast that it’s challenging to ensure that the users trading on them are not using private knowledge to their advantage, which is against the rules. When it comes to securities like stocks, similar behavior is punishable by up to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/25743/000138713113000737/ex14_02.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">20 years</a> in federal prison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potential for these markets to be manipulated has drawn attention among U.S. lawmakers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, one Polymarket user suspiciously <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/05/nx-s1-5667232/polymarket-maduro-bet-insider-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bet $32,000</a> that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro would be removed from power by the end of January — just hours later, the U.S. military captured Maduro, earning that user a $400,000 payout.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, Representative Ritchie Torres (D-NY) proposed <a href=\"https://ritchietorres.house.gov/posts/in-response-to-suspicious-polymarket-trade-preceding-maduro-operation-rep-ritchie-torres-introduces-legislation-to-crack-down-on-insider-trading-on-prediction-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legislation</a> that would make it illegal for government employees to trade on prediction markets related to government policy, government actions, or political outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mansourtarek_insider-trading-is-banned-on-kalshi-and-activity-7414691318947532800-ZPk9/?rcm=ACoAAAfCS4oBBsd-zF23gA1uc0N8O093XF2k324&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;utm_source=share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a Linkedin post</a> last month that he supports the bill, since Kalshi already adheres to the rules it would enforce. He claimed that alleged insider trading cases are not occurring on U.S.-based platforms (both Kalshi and Polymarket are based in the U.S.).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This American bill only applies to regulated, American companies and not to unregulated, non-American companies, which is where the alleged issues are occurring,” Mansour wrote. “Prediction markets, like any industry, are not a monolith: there are important distinctions that matter.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated, 2/25/25, 3:45 p.m. ET with comment from Beast Industries.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anger has grown so loud that it’s begun to shift legislative agendas. Some states and communities are mulling temporary bans on new data center development altogether. Earlier this month, New York joined the club, with a bold new proposal to halt the local cloud build-out in its tracks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S9144\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A n</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S9144\">ew bill</a> in New York State would impose a three-year moratorium on the issuance of new permits for data center construction throughout the state, while local regulators are given a chance to study the environmental and economic impacts the industry is having on communities. The bill’s co-authors, state senator Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Anna Kelles, have called the legislation the “<a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/ny-data-center-moratorium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">strongest</a>” introduced in the country.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While no statewide moratoriums have passed so far, local bans are proliferating fast. Several weeks before Krueger and Kelles introduced their bill, the New Orleans City Council <a href=\"https://www.wwno.org/economy/2026-01-29/new-orleans-city-council-bans-data-center-development-for-a-year-heres-why\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">passed a moratorium</a>, pausing all new data center construction in the city for one year. In early January, Madison, Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.cityofmadison.com/council/district3/blog/2026-01-11/proposal-to-establish-a-temporary-moratorium-on-new-data-centers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">passed a similar law</a> after protests erupted over regional tech projects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar policies have also passed in droves of communities throughout construction hot spots like <a href=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/2026/01/20/outrage-over-surge-of-data-centers-in-georgia-inspires-wave-of-bipartisan-bills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/at-least-19-michigan-towns-pause-data-centers-no-one-knows-if-itll-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Michigan</a>, as well as in many other regions throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02122023/virginia-environmentalists-protest-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Environmental activists</a> have long taken aim at data centers, but the more recent concerns have come from high-level lawmakers, drawing on populist anger at the tech industry broadly. In conservative Florida, for instance, Gov. Ron DeSantis recently announced an <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/governor-ron-desantis-announces-proposal-citizen-bill-rights-artificial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI “bill of rights”</a> that gives local communities the right to limit new data center construction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In liberal Vermont, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/07/congress/democrats-reject-bernie-sanders-data-center-pause-00713664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggested a nationwide moratorium</a>. And in Arizona, where the political milieu is <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-do-we-need-to-know-about-the-swing-state-of-arizona/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">decidedly mixed</a>, Gov.

Politicians have even begun to fight over the topics, with the governor of Mississippi <a href=\"https://x.com/tatereeves/status/2026309465901859025?s=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">taking shots</a> at Sanders online over his moratorium proposal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The political resistance is coming just as tech companies commit more and more money to building out infrastructure. The four biggest spenders — Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft — plan to spend <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a whopping $650 billion</a> in capital expenditures over the next year, the vast majority of it going to data center build-outs. Even more spending is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">planned in the following years</a>, as the companies race to secure as much compute capacity as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the speed and scale of those projects has made them increasingly unpopular, according to recent polling. <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterHamby/status/2026122722779238770?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A recent Echelon Insights poll</a> found 46% of respondents would oppose plans to build a data center in their community, compared with 35% in support. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/tech-industry-ai-data-centers-politics-00762348?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A different poll</a> from Politico found that, while there is considerable concern about the facilities, many voters don’t have much of an opinion either way — making it possible for public sentiment to be swayed in either direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry is already spending big to attempt to change those numbers — at least in the regions where it matters. In January, the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45d45fc-c0ea-463c-8edf-38fb99ed5c05\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a> some of the industry’s biggest data center operators were planning a “lobbying blitz,” with plans to “boost spending on targeted advertising and engagement” aimed at the communities where they build.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies are also making real concessions, like <a href=\"https://x.com/andrewcurran_/status/2026720928093319354?s=46&amp;t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the planned Rate Payer Protection Pledge</a> that would make them responsible for supplying power to any new AI data centers. But it’s not clear those measures will be enough to bring the public around.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dan Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition, argued, in a conversation with TechCrunch, that data centers should appeal to smaller communities because they provide revenue without straining those communities’ limited resources. If the incentives are cut off and companies decide not to build in those places, the revenue also won’t be there. “That’s where statewide policy considerations come in,” he said. “Are you going to limit communities in which these businesses could be a significant benefit for them?” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-logic-behind-pressing-pause\">The logic behind pressing pause </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In general, data center moratoriums are meant to give communities breathing room while policymakers study the potential costs and benefits of allowing such facilities to be built in their communities. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial-builders-are-losing-their-appetite-to-build-anything-but-data-centers-945c594f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdlypBXrI_34rqvisxw0GblBV3dyNkIpIywQd-BxLwWhC3H_9EEJ1JTaK-o1ec%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6998b29d&amp;gaa_sig=klkOc9jtIRM8Zd9PUsV7FiBwbC23qs6CMGKisf_1m1R6Rwz0PNZL7DnNagJbB3zRRZNbyGTsjGZIsl5eX_GFwA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rate of construction</a> in some states has accelerated at such a pace that communities are unsure of how the industry will impact them in the long run.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Justin Flagg, director of communications and environmental policy for Sen. Krueger’s office, told TechCrunch that the legislation was driven, in part, by what he called the energy affordability crisis in New York. Said crisis has troubled both rate payers and politicians. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A group of 30 state lawmakers recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqKSTQWtN-I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called upon</a> the state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, to declare an “energy state of emergency” in New York due to rate increases. While there are <a href=\"https://nysfocus.com/2025/09/18/new-york-energy-bill-hikes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a diversity of factors</a> at work in driving up energy prices, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">consensus</a> that the growth in data centers is making the problem worse, not better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s broad discontent being expressed about energy prices,” Flagg said. “We certainly hear that constantly from our constituents, whose electric and gas rates are going up.” He added that local pushback was also being driven by environmental concerns — which he described as the “water impact and the noise and the local infrastructure impact as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to those grid concerns, major tech companies — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/?p=3082319&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=3029459\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft</a>, Google, Meta, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/864798/openai-data-center-opposition-energy-bills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI</a> — have promised to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/climate/big-tech-warren-electricity-data-centers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pay for their additions to the electrical grid</a> in the communities where they operate, often installing behind-the-meter power sources paired with the new data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2026/02/19/data-centers-power-grid-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently reported</a> that Silicon Valley is increasingly looking to build its own private electrical supply — a kind of “shadow grid” — that can be used to operate the power-consumptive properties that are now fueling the AI industry. The strategy involves standing up massive new private power sources instead of relying on the public grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One example of this practice comes from xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup, which — at the site of its massive data center in Memphis, Tennessee, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/xais-colossus-supercomputer-raises-health-questions-in-memphis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">known as “Colossus”</a> — built a series of methane gas turbines that have been accused of polluting the local community. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s efforts have already run into significant trouble. xAI had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/15/elon-musk-xai-datacenter-memphis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> told local officials that, due to a legal loophole, the turbines were exempt from air-quality permits. In January, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/epa-rules-that-xais-natural-gas-generators-were-illegally-used/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ruled that</a> Musk’s company was not exempt from the permits, making their previous operation illegal. Environmental activists, decrying the facility’s discharge of “smog-forming pollution, soot, and hazardous chemicals,” <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/xai-built-an-illegal-power-plant-to-power-its-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> earlier this month that they planned to sue the company over it. Musk’s facility has since permitted its turbines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the xAI example illustrates, if the “shadow grid” strategy purports to solve one problem (public grid overload), it threatens to create a host of new ones — with environmental activists and local communities alike <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/big-tech/datacenter-developers-leverage-natural-gas-to-sidestep-power-grids-short-term-solution-might-increase-carbon-emissions-and-prove-costly-in-the-long-run\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expressing concern</a> for how the new facilities could spew pollution into people’s backyards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the federal level, the Trump administration — which has made AI one of its top priorities — has also sought to characterize the industry as responsible stewards of the communities in which they build. Indeed, Trump officials have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/navarro-trump-data-centers-affordability.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">floated a hypothetical policy</a> to force AI companies to internalize the costs of their additions to local electrical grids, although the details on this policy remain vague.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-debate-over-taxes\">Debate over taxes</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, communities have incentivized data center development through tax breaks. Last summer, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/tax-breaks-for-tech-giants-data-centers-mean-less-income-for-states.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an analysis by CNBC</a> found that 42 states throughout the U.S. either have no sales tax or provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to tech firms. Of that number, some 16 states publicly reported how much they had awarded to companies through tax breaks. The forfeited revenue amounted to some $6 billion over a period of five years, the outlet wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, however, more and more states are thinking about turning off the spigot. In Georgia, for instance, <a href=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/2026/01/20/outrage-over-surge-of-data-centers-in-georgia-inspires-wave-of-bipartisan-bills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a variety of bills were recently introduced</a> that would crack down on the industry’s benefits. State senator Matt Brass, who has introduced a bill that <a href=\"https://www.times-herald.com/news/sen-brass-files-bill-to-end-tax-break-for-future-data-centers/article_191fcf25-113d-42d4-8404-fd68f1f8b925.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">would nix the server sales tax exemption</a>, told TechCrunch that he doesn’t think tech companies need the extra money, nor does he think dispensing with the benefit will dissuade them from doing business in the state. “In Georgia, if you compare us to other states, our property taxes are low, our property values are low, our overall tax burden is low,” Brass said. “So, you know, our overall business climate is good. That should be the attraction.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brass, who chairs the state’s rules committee, told TechCrunch that he expects there to be significant support for his policy. A similar piece of legislation passed the Georgia legislature in 2024, but it was vetoed by the governor. Brass added that, were the exemption to be done away with, he believes it could generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Ohio, a similar policy battle is currently playing out. A group of Democratic lawmakers recently <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/02/09/ohio-democrats-offer-slate-of-bills-reining-in-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced legislation</a> that would — like in Georgia — move to nix the state’s sales tax exemption. A similar policy was introduced last year, but — like in Georgia — it was defeated by the state’s governor, Mike DeWine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The most ridiculous tax break on the books currently is for data centers,” one of the bill’s supporting lawmakers, state Sen. Kent Smith, <a href=\"https://www.wowktv.com/news/ohio-lawmakers-consider-repealing-tax-breaks-for-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently said</a>. “That tax break needs to end, for the benefit of everyone who’s got an electric bill.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, there are still plenty of lawmakers who support the server sales tax exemption. In Colorado, state representative Alex Valdez <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/HB26-1030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently introduced a bill</a> that would enshrine data centers’ loophole for the next 20 years. Valdez told TechCrunch that the exemption is merely a carrot to get tech companies in the door. Once they set up a base of operations in the state, they become a source of passive revenue that inevitably boomerangs back to benefit the communities in which they operate, he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Operating there successfully would strengthen Waymo’s case that its system is nationally scalable. It also gives Waymo another shot at a northern city after New York <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/new-york-driverless-rideshare-nyc-waymo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped a proposal</a> that would have allowed commercial robotaxi pilots in parts of the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes the same week Waymo began offering commercial driverless operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-operating-in-10-us-cities/\">bringing its total city count to 10.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from Chicago and Charlotte, Waymo is also testing and planning to launch in Denver, London, and Washington, D.C., among other cities.

For starters, the automations can’t be kicked off without an explicit command from the device’s owner. As they run, you can watch their progress in real time and stop the task if it’s making a mistake or getting stuck. Google notes also that the automations take place in a secure, virtual window on your phone where they can only access limited apps, not the rest of the data on your device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature ties into the growing trend of using AI to automate more tasks in users’ personal lives.

The company rolled out ads <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-rolls-out-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to U.S.-based users earlier this month</a> amid criticism from rivals like Anthropic, which published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/sam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads/#:~:text=own%20chatbot%2C%20Claude.-,Another%20commercial,-features%20a%20slight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a string of Super Bowl ads</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the sidelines of the India AI summit, TechCrunch asked <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/openai-coo-says-we-have-not-yet-really-seen-ai-penetrate-enterprise-business-processes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap</a> about how the company is approaching ads. Lightcap said that the process is iterative and the company has to get user privacy and trust right.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Well, this is going to be an iterative process for sure. This is something we are committed to getting right. What does that look like? It means obviously maintaining user trust at a very high level. It means getting privacy right,” Lightcap said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also noted that ads can add to the product experience of users if they are done right. He urged to give OpenAI a few months to see how the company fares in rolling out the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It means really creating a delightful product experience. We think ads done right can be additive to a product experience. And so it’ll take iteration, it’ll take time, but we’re just starting out. So maybe give us a few months and see how it goes,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightcap didn’t specify if the company is thinking about rolling out ads beyond the U.S. market at the moment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Sam Altman hit back at Anthropic with <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019139174339928189%7Ctwgr%5Ea4b3a014b37f8325129952141c9fb783ac0afcb0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fsam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads%2F\">a long post on X</a> about the Super Bowl ads, calling the OpenAI rival “dishonest” and accusing them of making an expensive product that serves “rich people.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency.

From his own experience, the best way to build today is to explore, be playful, and not expect to be an expert at what you do right away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I wish I could say that I had the unified plan in the beginning, but a lot of it was just exploration,” Steinberger said. “I wanted things, and those things didn’t exist, and … let’s say I prompted them into existence.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The developer was chatting with OpenAI’s Head of Developer Experience, Romain Huet, on the first episode of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jgcT0Fqt7U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the company’s new Builders Unscripted podcast</a>. Here, he spoke about what OpenClaw was like in its early days and how he didn’t have a plan when he got started.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger explained he began by building a tool that would integrate with WhatsApp, but then set it aside for a bit and focused on other things, as he assumed the AI labs would build something like what he was working on in the near future.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I just experimented a lot. My mission was, kind of like, to have fun and inspire people,” Steinberger noted. By last November, however, the developer was surprised that no AI labs had started to build what he wanted to use. That led him to create the initial prototype of what’s now OpenClaw. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where it really clicked was where I was at this weekend trip in Marrakesh, and I found myself using it way more because it was so convenient … There was no really good internet. [But] WhatsApp just works everywhere,” he said. The tool made it easy for him to find restaurants, look up things on his computer, send texts to friends, and more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Builders Unscripted: Ep. 1 - Peter Steinberger, Creator of OpenClaw\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jgcT0Fqt7U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more he played with the technology, Steinberger realized how good modern AI models have become at problem-solving, much like coders are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now they can just, like, actually come up with the solutions themselves, even though you never programmed them at all,” he noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Throughout the process of building, Steinberger said that his workflow improved — and he stresses to other developers that’s something that can take time, so don’t give up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s these people that … write software in the old way, and the old way is going to go away,” he pointed out. They then decide to try vibe coding but are disappointed with the results.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think vibe coding is a slur,” said Steinberger, basically suggesting that it’s not as simple a process at first as the term makes it sound. “They try AI, but they don’t understand that it’s a skill,” he said, then compared the process of coding with AI to learning guitar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re not going to be good at guitar on the first day,” he said. Instead, he recommends that people approach learning with a more playful attitude. If he writes a prompt now, he has a gut feeling as to how long it will take, and if it takes longer, he reflects on what may have gone wrong and adapts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My … advice always is, approach it in a playful way. Build something that you always wanted to build. If you’re at least a little bit of a builder, there has to be something on the back of your mind that you want to build. Like, just play.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to experiment and have fun is what’s most important, especially at a time when people are worried their jobs will be overtaken by AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If your identity is: I want to create things. I want to solve problems. If you’re high agency, if you’re smart, you will be in more demand than ever,” Steinberger said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
