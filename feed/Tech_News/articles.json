That gap has created an opportunity for technology companies and banks to embed lending into widely used payments apps, helping explain Google’s move into the space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flex by Google Pay is issued digitally through the Google Pay app and can be used both online and at physical merchants, the company said. Built on the Indian government-backed RuPay network, the card includes a rewards programme that credits virtual “Stars” on transactions, with each Star worth ₹1. Users can monitor spending and bills within the app, choose to repay balances in full or convert them into installments, and manage security settings such as blocking the card or resetting a PIN.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch builds on Google Pay’s broader effort to expand access to credit in India, where it has already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/google-pay-deepens-consumer-and-merchant-lending-offerings-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnered with banks and non-bank lenders</a> to <a href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/outreach-initiatives/google-for-india-2024-bringing-ai-to-every-indian-across-our-products/#:~:text=3.%20Expanding%20Financial%20Inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">offer personal</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/google-taps-india-love-for-gold-to-boost-its-credit-play/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gold-backed loans</a> through the app. As one of the country’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/29/indias-mobile-payments-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most widely used UPI platforms</a>, Google Pay offers Axis Bank access to a large, digitally active user base at a time when lenders are increasingly looking to scale credit distribution through technology platforms rather than physical branches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Google has started with Axis Bank, it aims to add more issuer partners soon to expand its co-branded credit card offering in India.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076601\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg 1740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1200,788 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1280,840 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=430,282 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=720,473 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=900,591 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=800,525 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=1536,1008 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=668,438 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=571,375 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=940,617 940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=708,465 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/google-pay-flex.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1740px) 100vw, 1740px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pricing on the card, including interest and applicable charges, will vary by user and credit profile, with no application fee, Google said, adding that charges linked to repayment choices are shown upfront in the app. Processing fees apply to EMI conversions, and late payment charges will be levied in line with the issuing bank’s policy.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s credit card market has been expanding rapidly in recent years. The number of outstanding cards has grown at an annual rate of about 14% over the past three years to around 110 million, while transaction volumes and values have risen at close to 30%, per a recent <a href=\"https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/indian-payments-handbook-2025-2030.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PwC report</a> (PDF). Average annual spending per card has increased from about ₹132,000 (around $1,450) to roughly ₹192,000 (about $2,100), suggesting cards are being used more frequently for routine payments rather than occasional big-ticket purchases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite growth in the number of outstanding cards and credit card spending in India, the expansion has largely been driven by existing users rather than a meaningful increase in the number of cardholders. Google aims to help address that gap by bringing new users into the credit system, particularly those wary of traditional card repayment structures. “It’s the same users getting more and more credit,” said Sharath Bulusu, senior director of product management for Google Pay, adding that flexible repayment options are designed to ease concerns around unpredictable billing for first-time credit users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We think we now understand the problem, the space and the user well enough to solve something uniquely for them,” Bulusu told TechCrunch, explaining Google’s timing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s move comes amid growing competition in India’s co-branded credit card market, where companies including Amazon, as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart and PhonePe, already offer similar products. Consumer internet platforms such as food delivery firms Swiggy and Zomato, along with online travel companies including MakeMyTrip and Yatra, have also entered the space in partnership with banks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-branded credit cards accounted for about 12–15% of India’s total credit cards in the financial year ended 2024 and are projected to capture more than a quarter of the market by volume by 2028, growing at an annual rate of 35–40%, according to a <a href=\"https://redseer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hyperface-Redseer-Report-The-Rise-of-Co-branded-Credit-Cards-3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report</a> (PDF) by consultancy firm Redseer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the co-branded card launch, Google is also rolling out “Pocket Money,” a feature in the Google Pay app that lets parents give children limited access to digital payments. Built on the recently introduced UPI Circle functionality, the feature lets parents set a monthly spending cap of up to ₹15,000 or approve individual transactions initiated by the child.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parents receive notifications for each transaction and can view spending history or pause access to the feature through their own Google Pay app, the company said. The move could also help Google broaden Google Pay’s usage and addressable market in India, where it <a href=\"https://entrackr.com/news/phonepe-records-94-bn-upi-transactions-in-october-10785555\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">competes closely with Walmart-backed PhonePe</a> among the country’s leading UPI platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s Pocket Money feature follows earlier efforts by Indian fintechs such as FamPay and Junio, which sought to enable children’s digital spending through prepaid cards. However, unlike prepaid instruments, Google uses the UPI Circle framework to let parents retain control of funds until the moment a transaction is made, rather than loading money in advance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With UPI Circle, the money stays in the parent’s account until it is spent,” Bulusu said, adding that the approach makes it easier for families already comfortable using Google Pay to introduce children to digital payments. He said the feature reflects a broader bet on familiar payments apps as a way to build financial confidence among younger users as digital payments become more pervasive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also upgrading the experience for small businesses on Google Pay, allowing customers to rate merchants directly after a transaction, with those reviews syncing to the merchant’s Google Maps listing. The company is also rolling out an AI-powered advertising feature within the Google Pay for Business app that assists merchants in creating and launching ads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 530 million unique users have made at least one payment through Google Pay, while over 23 million small merchants have been onboarded to the platform over the years, Bulusu said. That reach, he added, gives the company confidence it can introduce new financial products to users already comfortable transacting digitally.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round was led by ChrysCapital and Dragon Funds, with participation from Schroders Capital and existing investors TR Capital and B Capital. Early backers, including Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Venture Partners, Z47, and Ventureast, sold shares in the secondary transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal valued MoEngage at “well over” $900 million post-money, per a person close to the deal, who added that the startup was tracking toward $100 million in annualised recurring revenue this year. MoEngage did not disclose these figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage plans to use the fresh capital to invest further in its Merlin AI suite and expand its use of AI agents to improve decision-making and efficiency for marketing teams, said Raviteja Dodda (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive, in an interview. The startup is also pushing deeper into product and engineering teams by bundling its analytics and transactional messaging tools into a broader offering, a move it expects to lift average contract values and expand its addressable market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you look at customer engagement, it is not necessarily focused on marketing teams. There are product and engineering teams, which also focus on how to make sense of customer behavior and data,” Dodda said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage also plans to use part of its fresh capital raise to pursue strategic acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, targeting software companies that complement its customer engagement platform or help accelerate its expansion in those markets. It also targets small AI teams to bolster its intelligence-led offerings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 11-year-old startup, which has its headquarters in Bengaluru and San Francisco, already gets more than 30% of its revenue from North America, about 25% from Europe and the Middle East, and the remaining 45% from India and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage’s secondary-heavy structure of the raise reflects its late-stage position, allowing early investors and employees to take liquidity without forcing the company into a near-term public listing. This approach gives MoEngage flexibility to choose its next steps based on business priorities rather than investor exit timelines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It gives us the opportunity not to have an urgency with regard to going IPO,” Dodda said, adding that the startup still aims to go public in a couple of years, depending on market conditions and other factors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MoEngage expects to turn earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) positive this quarter and is targeting compound annual growth of about 35% over the next three years, Dodda said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bhavin Turakhia, co-founder and chief executive of fintech firm Zeta, a MoEngage customer, said the startup’s analytics and messaging tools have helped it improve onboarding, activation, and cross-sell across key customer journeys.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The secondary component of the round also enabled some early investors to exit fully. Ventureast, which backed MoEngage in 2018, is one of them. The VC firm recorded a roughly 10-times return on its investment on a blended basis, its partner Vinay Rao told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rao said that while many global customer engagement companies operate with cost structures geared toward the U.S. market, MoEngage has retained an India-based cost structure, which he said has helped it compete more effectively in the U.S. while scaling the business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the latest round, MoEngage has raised about $307 million in primary funding to date. Avendus advised MoEngage for the transaction.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A key issue, apparently, was IPO timing. Anil pushed for an earlier listing than some directors wanted and signaled he might leave soon after, while board members sought more time to expand internationally and grow the company’s valuation. (Monzo was reportedly valued at $5.9 billion in an October 2024 secondary share sale backed by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and StepStone Group.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch sat down with Anil in person this summer, and we discussed the possibility of Monzo going public in 2026, a timeline that now appears to have been at the center of boardroom disagreements.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Future of Digital Finance l StrictlyVC London\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pqo3qyUg3jA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br><br>Under Anil’s leadership since 2020, Monzo reportedly tripled its customer base to 13 million and posted record £60.5 million pre-tax profits.

The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/tesla-s-sales-in-california-set-to-be-suspended-dmv-says?srnd=homepage-americas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg News</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/tesla_na/status/2001103872891486627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has faced multiple investigations from the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/tesla-under-investigation-by-california-attorney-general.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">California Attorney General</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Department of Justice</a>, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/tesla-starts-testing-robotaxis-in-austin-with-no-safety-driver/\">the company removed the safety monitors</a> from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release</em> <em>and Tesla’s response.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After going public during the pandemic and scoring a key deal with Volvo, the company had added Mercedes-Benz and Polestar as customers of its “<a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/48/luminar-ceo-says-volvo-ex90-defines-a-new-era-of-safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lifesaving</a>” lidar sensors. Founder and CEO Austin Russell <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/59/luminar-achieves-new-wins-expands-roadmap-at-ces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called it</a> an “inflection point,” as Luminar prepped to have those sensors integrated into the first production vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Volvo in particular was all in on the technology. The Swedish automaker, which spent decades building a brand around the idea of making the safest cars, was the first to jump at integrating the laser-based sensors in its vehicles. Volvo initially tapped Luminar to provide 39,500 lidar sensors over the life of a deal signed in 2020. In 2021, Volvo upped that to 673,000. And in 2022, Volvo upped it again, this time to 1.1 million sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three years later, Luminar is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">now in bankruptcy</a>. The company has already <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/111/luminar-announces-sale-of-photonics-business-to-quantum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">made a deal</a> to sell off one subsidiary centered around semiconductors and is looking to sell its lidar business during the Chapter 11 process, which began on Monday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first batch of filings in the bankruptcy case shed new light on how Luminar’s cornerstone deal with Volvo came apart — and how its undoing helped push the once-promising startup over the edge.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-big-promises-then-big-revisions\">Big promises, then big revisions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar made “substantial up-front investments in equipment, facilities, and workforce” to meet the demand from Volvo back in 2022, according to a <a href=\"https://casedocs.omniagentsolutions.com/cmsvol2/pub_47582/372fc06a-000d-40d8-9eec-521770a9a89f_20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declaration</a> written by Luminar’s newly hired chief restructuring officer Robin Chiu. It built out <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/66/luminar-announces-new-automated-high-volume-factory-begins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico</a>, and spent nearly $200 million to prepare to make its Iris lidar sensors for Volvo’s EX90 SUV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Volvo was going to be a marquee customer, the stepping stone to introducing the company’s Iris product to the broader automotive industry,” one of Luminar’s lawyers said during the first hearing in the bankruptcy case on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, according to Chiu, problems were already brewing with Volvo. The automaker delayed the EX90 SUV because it needed to do more “software testing and development,” the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/11/23719686/volvo-ex90-delay-software-production-luminar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">automaker said in 2023</a>. And in early 2024, Luminar says Volvo reduced its expected volume for Iris sensors by 75%.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar’s other deals started to sour, too. Polestar (a subsidiary of Volvo) quietly gave up on integrating Luminar’s lidar sensors “because the vehicle’s software ultimately could not use” the features, according to Chiu. Mercedes-Benz terminated its agreement to buy Luminar’s Iris sensors in November 2024 because the lidar-maker “failed to meet ambitious requirements,” according to Chiu. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Mercedes-Benz struck up a new deal with Luminar in March 2025 for its next-generation Halo lidar, but Chiu wrote that Luminar has “no go-forward projects” with the German automaker at the time of bankruptcy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This left Luminar with Volvo as its lone flagship customer. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company never diversified much beyond the automotive industry, shunning other applications like defense or robotics. In fact, Russell had founded Luminar in 2012 with the goal of taking lidar out of those sectors and into automotive to help accelerate the adoption of autonomous vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It wasn’t until March of this year that Russell talked about expanding beyond automotive, as Luminar signed <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-03-27/lidar-maker-luminar-inks-deal-with-caterpillar-video\">a deal with construction equipment company Caterpillar</a>. Just two months later, Russell <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/billionaire-founder-of-luminar-replaced-as-ceo-following-ethics-inquiry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">abruptly resigned</a> following an ethics inquiry from Luminar’s board of directors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-bad-news\">“More bad news”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Chiu’s account, Volvo kept promising that it would meet the lifetime order of 1.1 million units despite the reduced volume in 2024. So Luminar kept pressing forward under that assumption. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But signs of stress were showing. Luminar laid off 20% of its workforce in May 2024 and outsourced more of its lidar sensor manufacturing. It <a href=\"https://www.luminartech.com/updates/a-message-from-founder-ceo-austin-russell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">deepened those cuts</a> and restructured some of its business in September 2024. Another round of layoffs came in May 2025 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/luminar-kicks-off-another-round-of-layoffs-amid-ceos-sudden-resignation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">after Russell resigned</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, “Volvo delivered more bad news,” Chiu wrote. The automaker decided to offer lidar as an option on the EX90 going forward, instead of making it a standard feature as originally planned. Volvo also told Luminar that it was shelving lidar on future vehicles “as a cost-cutting measure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This change reduced Volvo’s estimated lifetime volumes by approximately 90%,” Chiu wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar told Volvo on October 3 that it considered this a breach of the agreement the companies had first signed in 2020. On October 31, the dispute became public, as Luminar told shareholders in a regulatory filing that it was suspending sensor shipments to Volvo. The Swedish automaker sent Luminar a letter two weeks later, terminating the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Volvo told TechCrunch in a statement Tuesday that it “made this decision to limit the company’s supply chain risk exposure and it is a direct result of Luminar’s failure to meet its contractual obligations to Volvo Cars.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The company’s products can deliver a high level of safety and driver support, enabled by the cars’ powerful core computing coupled with their advanced sensor set — with or without a lidar,” a Volvo spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar, meanwhile, started selling lidar sensors meant for Volvo “to adjacent markets in an effort to recover its sunk costs,” according to Chiu’s filing, but it was too little too late.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As its relationship with Volvo deteriorated, [Luminar] worked tirelessly to identify new customers, but was ultimately unable to enter into production with any new customers in a timely fashion,” Chiu wrote. “The public Volvo dispute also resulted in a decline in sales due to broader market concerns over Luminar’s financial future.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the future of what’s left of Luminar is in the hands of its creditors and the court. It’s seeking the judge’s approval to sell the semiconductor subsidiary to Quantum Computing, Inc. <a href=\"https://investors.luminartech.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/111/luminar-announces-sale-of-photonics-business-to-quantum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">for $110 million</a>, and hopes to court a number of bidders for the lidar business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar has already had significant interest in the lidar business, according to the filing. In January, Chiu wrote, the company hired investment bank Jefferies to evaluate a sale after receiving an “unsolicited acquisition proposal.” Luminar received “additional unsolicited inbound expressions of interest to acquire the Company” through the summer and fall — including one submitted by Russell through his new AI lab in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TechCrunch reported Monday, Russell <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">plans to keep bidding</a> on Luminar’s remains as the bankruptcy case moves forward. During Tuesday’s hearing, a lawyer for Luminar said it is “deep into the sale process” and “in negotiations with” several potential bidders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with a statement from Volvo and information from Luminar’s first bankruptcy hearing.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On <a href=\"https://wikiflix.toolforge.org/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WikiFlix</a>, a Netflix-inspired archive of public domain films, you can watch movies like “It’s a Wonderful Life” and “Nosferatu” for free. You don’t even have to make an account! Crazy, right?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A project of Wikipedia’s volunteer community, WikiFlix hosts over 4,000 movies from Wikimedia Commons, the Internet Archive, or YouTube that have fallen into the public domain — that means they are free to share and distribute, usually because the copyright lapsed, or there was never any copyright at all. So, yes, most of the movies on the WikiFlix homepage are your grandma’s age, but isn’t it kind of fun to imagine what Netflix would’ve been like back in the day?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WikiFlix isn’t new, but it’s new to us, courtesy of a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@depthsofwikipedia/video/7582475345710845239?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TikTok</a> by Annie Rauwerda, the creator behind the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depths_of_Wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Depths of Wikipedia</a>” accounts.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While WikiFlix can introduce you to historic films like “Wings,” the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, there’s also a bunch of hidden gems on there. As Rauwerda says in her TikTok, “Sometimes I really like watching things that I know nobody else is watching, because what if I discover something crazy?” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On its homepage, WikiFlix prioritizes movies that have a lot of sitelinks on their Wikipedia pages, since those are more likely to be popular or interesting. But there is some degree of curation. The community around WikiFlix maintains a blacklist, which helps ensure that you’re not going to run into a historical Nazi propaganda film during your next “WikiFlix and chill” night. (“While these [films] are perfectly fine in an educational context, WikiFlix is more focused on entertainment,” a <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:WikiFlix/Movie_blacklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WikiFlix page</a> says.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WikiFlix content may not exactly be as binge-worthy as “Stranger Things,” but give it a try. Why not watch a <a href=\"https://wikiflix.toolforge.org/#/entry/620231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Soviet musical</a> inspired by Cinderella, a <a href=\"https://wikiflix.toolforge.org/#/entry/2377258\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">silent film</a> about swashbuckling pirates, or a <a href=\"https://wikiflix.toolforge.org/#/entry/1459428\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Japanese post-apocalyptic film</a> that features <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Connors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a guy</a> who somehow played for both the Boston Celtics <em>and</em> the Chicago Cubs?

In some cases, consumers were paying as much as 23% more than other shoppers for the exact same product, the report says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software involved in the experiments, Eversight, is a SaaS product that <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/company/retailer-platform/connected-stores/eversight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">offers grocers</a> a retail pricing suite designed to “unlock revenue growth” and capitalize on “pricing solutions that scale your pricing strategy and uncover optimal prices your customers expect.” Instacart discloses on its Eversight page that some shoppers “may see slightly higher prices” than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, as previously noted, some of those price hikes seem slightly higher than “slightly higher.” A 23% price hike isn’t exactly chump change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, Instacart referred TechCrunch to a previously <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/instacart-s-commitment-to-affordability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released statement</a> in which the company noted that “just as retailers have long tested prices in physical stores to understand what resonates with customers, a small subset of our retail partners – 10 U.S. retail partners that already choose to apply markups – use Instacart’s Eversight technology to run limited online pricing tests.” The company also took issue with its activity being referred to as “dynamic pricing,” calling it instead an “AI-enabled pricing experiment.” An Instacart spokesperson said: “These tests are not dynamic pricing – prices never change in real-time, including in response to supply and demand. The tests are never based on personal or behavioral characteristics — they are completely randomized.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dynamic pricing has become increasingly common in recent years, and many big e-commerce sites have been accused of employing it. Another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/us-schools-amazon-algorithmic-pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent report</a> claimed that, due to dynamic pricing used by Amazon, school districts across the U.S. have been paying higher prices for basic school supplies.

Time and again over the last few years, we have seen EV companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/16/fisker-touts-31000-reservations-for-its-ocean-suv-as-production-draws-closer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tout reservation figures</a> only to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/30/the-fall-of-ev-startup-fisker-a-comprehensive-timeline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">go bust</a>, either because they weren’t able to get through the difficult process of standing up production, or because they weren’t ready to have cars on the road.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Slate, it’s promising that the number has continued to climb, meaning that new reservations are coming in faster than any attrition the company might be seeing. That said, Slate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/slate-auto-crosses-100000-refundable-reservations-in-two-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">crossed the 100,000 reservation mark</a> all the way back in May, right after it came out of stealth, so it took a good seven months to grow the list by 50%. And looking forward, Slate plans to make 150,000 of these EVs per year at the factory it’s refurbishing in Warsaw, Indiana, so it will need to attract far more buyers if it plans to succeed in the market.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Any continued enthusiasm for Slate’s EV has to be a reassuring sign for the company, given the state of electric trucks overall these days. Just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/fords-next-f-150-lightning-will-have-a-gas-generator-as-it-pivots-away-from-large-evs/\">yesterday</a>, Ford announced it is ending production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, the first major battery-powered pickup truck to hit the U.S. market a few years ago. (It’s being replaced by a version with a gas generator attached.) The company said the Lightning simply wasn’t making enough money — a fact exacerbated by how Ford was never able to sell more than a few thousand per quarter. Sales of other electric trucks, like Tesla’s Cybertruck and General Motors’ Silverado EV, have also struggled to stay above that mark.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, the Lightning was a sort-of Frankenstein’s monster of a vehicle, with Ford shoehorning EV technology into a design that was originally meant for gas powertrains. Slate’s truck has been designed from the ground up to be an EV, and the company is hyper-focused on selling it for a price tag in the mid-$20,000 range. The decline of offerings from Ford and others may help clear the way for Slate to find early success — that is, until Ford’s real shot at a low-cost EV hits the market in 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The app, called <a href=\"https://www.zesty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Zesty</a>, is initially available in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the app, DoorDash is branching out beyond food delivery and stepping into the social and discovery space. The idea behind the app is to get rid of the need to read a bunch of different reviews, look up different menus, or browse TikTok when looking for a new place to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once people open the app and sign in with their DoorDash accounts, they can ask an AI chatbot for personalized recommendations based on what they’re looking for. In an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zestyapp/reel/DSS6wVSD5eE/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Instagram promo post</a>, the company shared that users can type prompts like, “A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that’s actually good for introverts” to find specific recommendations. Users will also see suggested prompts, such as “Brunch spots good for groups,” and “Romantic dinner with a vintage feel.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang wrote in an <a href=\"https://x.com/andyfang/status/2000728321739645236\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">X post</a> that the app aggregates info across DoorDash, Google Maps, TikTok, and more to “curate the best suggestions from the web.” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076579\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg 3960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1200,869 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1280,927 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=430,311 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=720,521 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=900,652 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=800,579 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=1536,1112 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=2048,1483 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=668,484 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=518,375 518w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=852,617 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=708,513 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/zesty-app_1cdb40.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Zesty</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app also learns your tastes to figure out what you do and don’t like.

We’re excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the app’s launch was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/doordash-launches-zesty-an-ai-powered-app-for-finding-new-restaurants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, some people may not want to download a whole new app to find new restaurants when they could simply use Google.

The feature will initially become available on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the U.S. and Canada, the company says. In addition, the glasses are getting another update that lets you use Spotify to play a song that matches what’s in your current view.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, if you’re looking at an album cover, the glasses could play a song by that artist. Or if you’re looking at your Christmas tree with a pile of gifts, you could play holiday music. This addition is more of a gimmick, of course, but it demonstrates how Meta is thinking about connecting what people see with actions they can take in their apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The conversation-focus feature, meanwhile, seems more practical. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/meta-connect-2025-what-to-expect-and-how-to-watch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">First announced at Meta’s Connect conference</a> earlier this year, the feature uses the AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to. Meta says smart glasses wearers will also be able to adjust the amplification level by swiping the right temple of their glasses, or via the device settings. This will allow them to set the level more precisely to match their current environment, whether that’s a busy restaurant or bar, club, commuter train, or anything else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How well the feature works, of course, will still need to be tested. However, the idea of using smart accessories as tools to help with hearing isn’t limited to Meta. Apple’s AirPods already offer a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/airpods/use-and-customize-transparency-mode-dev966f5f818/web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Conversation Boost feature</a> designed to help you focus on the person you’re talking to, and the Pro models more recently added support for a<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/120992\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the conversation-focus feature is limited to the U.S. and Canada, the Spotify feature is offered in English in a larger number of markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software update (v21) will first become available to those who are enrolled in Meta’s Early Access Program, which requires first joining a <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/early-access-program/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">waitlist</a> and being approved. It will later roll out more broadly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s the latest escalation in the competition with Google’s Gemini after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month declared a “code red” in a leaked internal memo. The memo detailed OpenAI’s plans to regain its position as the AI leader after Google had begun to take market share following the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/google-launches-gemini-3-with-new-coding-app-and-record-benchmark-scores/\">release of Gemini 3</a>, its latest flagship model, and Nano Banana Pro, the newest version of Google’s viral image generator — both of which have topped the <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LMArena leaderboard</a> across multiple benchmarks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google maintains its lead even after OpenAI responded to its success last week with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/openai-fires-back-at-google-with-gpt-5-2-after-code-red-memo/\">launch of GPT-5.2</a>, pitching it as its most advanced model yet for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/openai-boasts-enterprise-win-days-after-internal-code-red-on-google-threat/?_thumbnail_id=3073655\">developers and everyday professional use</a>. OpenAI had reportedly been planning to release a new image generator in early January, accelerating those plans with this week’s announcement. Its last image model release was GPT Image 1 in April. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT Image 1.5 arrives as image and video generators advance beyond prototypes and gain more production-ready capabilities. Like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/google-releases-nano-banana-pro-its-latest-image-generation-model/\">Nano Banana Pro</a>, ChatGPT Image offers post-production features, providing more granular edit controls to maintain visual consistency, like facial likeness, lighting, composition, and color tone across edits. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076523\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-2.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The same image depicted above with different edits to showcase GPT Image 1.5’s improved instruction-following</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most GenAI image tools are bad at iteration, so this would be a huge step up.

ChatGPT images will also now be accessible via a dedicated entry point in the ChatGPT sidebar that works “more like a creative studio,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, <a href=\"https://fidjisimo.substack.com/p/more-dynamic-ai-experiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> in a blog post Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The new image viewing and editing screens make it easier to create images that match your vision or get inspiration from trending prompts and preset filters,” Simo wrote.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of the new image generator, OpenAI is introducing new ways to improve the ChatGPT experience with more visual elements. The plan is to make search queries display more visuals with clear sources, which could be helpful for tasks like converting measurements or checking sports scores, per Simo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When you’re creating, you should be able to see and shape the thing you’re making. When visuals tell a story better than words alone, ChatGPT should include them,” Simo wrote. “When you need a quick answer or the next step lives in another tool, it should be right there. As we do this, we can keep closing the distance between what’s in your mind and your ability to bring it to life.”</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While patients expected doctors to respond as quickly as their delivery apps, most medical professionals on the continent are forced to rely on WhatsApp for all patient communication.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I thought, as a patient, especially as an American, how incredible that I can text my doctor on WhatsApp, and they’ll respond,” she told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Merin also realized just how overwhelming this communication method had become for physicians. “A doctor who sees 20 patients during the day, gets home, has 100 messages and is expected to answer immediately and remember who the patient is without the health record in front of them,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merin, who had long been interested in building her own startup, saw an opportunity to improve doctors’ communication challenges. So, two years ago, she launched <a href=\"https://www.leona.health/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Leona Health</a>, an AI-copilot integrated with doctors’ WhatsApp accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, Leona revealed that it raised $14 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst; Accel; Maven Clinic CEO Kate Ryder; Nubank CEO David Vélez; and Rappi CEO Simón Borrero. The startup also announced that its service is now available to doctors in 14 Latin American countries across 22 medical specialties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Leona, patients continue to send messages on WhatsApp, but doctors receive and manage that communication through the startup’s mobile app. The app sorts all messages in order of priority, suggests responses, and allows other team members (like doctors or nurses) to reply to patients on the doctor’s behalf.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup will also soon launch a fully autonomous agent that will handle conversational scheduling and simple intake.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solving the WhatsApp communication challenge in Latin America is critical because, according to Merin, patients in Latin America often choose their doctors based on their willingness to communicate using this channel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These poor doctors, they’re receiving requests for very serious medical consults to, ‘I need a letter for my kids’ school,’ or, ‘I want a receipt for my appointment last week,’” Merin said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since these messages can arrive in the evenings and on weekends, physicians are often forced to monitor their WhatsApp around the clock. Leona solves this by immediately alerting doctors only to the most serious health requests and allowing them to deprioritize more routine or administrative questions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The idea is to help the doctor regain time,” Merin said. “We’re hearing from our users that they’re saving two to three hours a day by using Leona.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Leona is starting by serving Latin America, the company’s long-term mission is to expand its services to other geographies, where, unlike in the U.S., patients also demand and are permitted to communicate with their doctors via WhatsApp, rather than through electronic medical records systems like Epic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leona’s team of 13 is currently split between Mexico City and Silicon Valley, where, according to Merin, the best AI engineers are located.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said that the assistant is only available to consumer Google accounts at the moment and not Workspace accounts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are several examples of AI-powered email-based briefs and assistants.

This represents Netflix’s second major step into the podcast space, following its recent collaboration with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/spotifys-video-podcasts-are-coming-to-netflix-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new video podcast episodes will premiere on Netflix in the U.S. in early 2026, with plans to expand to additional markets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the agreement, Netflix will get a diverse range of shows spanning comedy, crime, history, sports, and more, which feature notable names such as “Dear Chelsea” with Chelsea Handler, “The Breakfast Club” with Charlamagne, and “My Favorite Murder” with Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal covers all new episodes from the podcast lineup, as well as select library episodes from each show. Meanwhile, iHeartMedia will retain the audio-only rights and distribution, ensuring podcasts remain available on iHeartRadio and other major podcast platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix hopes that the millions of people who prefer the video version of these shows will flock to the streaming platform over competitors like YouTube. However, since these podcasters are no longer getting video versions of their shows on YouTube, they could lose out on ad revenue and reach, potentially alienating fans who are accustomed to watching there. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal follows Netflix’s announcement of a similar deal with Spotify for shows including “The Ringer,” “The Bill Simmons Podcast,” and “The Zach Lowe Show.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix’s push into video podcasts is part of its mission to broaden its offerings beyond TV shows and movies. For instance, Netflix struck a deal with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/style/ms-rachel-netflix-show.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">YouTube personalities Ms. Rachel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20939pp04po\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mark Rober</a> to appeal to a wider audience and tap into the growing creator economy.

She would listen to every podcast and read each book, taking notes on topics that interested her.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She didn’t think much of it until one summer when so many of her friends got married that she found herself spending thousands of dollars on bridesmaid dresses and bachelorette looks. One day, someone approached her and asked to borrow one of her dresses. “I was like ‘yeah, for sure, take it,’” she recalled. “And then I thought, ‘how can this be done on a larger scale?’” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles had all these expensive dresses just sitting in her closet. She didn’t want to sell them, but she knew she probably would never wear those gowns again. “That’s what led me, long story short, to create Rax,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles <a href=\"https://www.raxapp.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Rax earlier</a> this year as a peer-to-peer clothing rental company. It functions right now as a marketplace (it does not own any clothing inventory), where users scroll through listings and connect with people who have clothing items they want to rent.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She’s bootstrapped the company so far, enough to fully code the app and officially launch it. The first few customers were her friends and family, and the rest came by word of mouth. Alles said she leaned into the idea of “building in public,” where she posted online about her adventures creating this product in hopes of amassing an engaged audience of potential customers. She has about 5,000 users on the app right now.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rax is one of the first of its kind to be launched in Toronto. It’s like Rent-the-Runway, or the US’s Pickle, or Europe’s By Rotation. The idea of renting clothes — similar to buying secondhand — has been picking up steam as it is seen as a more environmentally sustainable way to consume fashion rather than buying new items for each new season.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s driving the circularity of fashion,” Alles said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what makes Rax different from many others is that she offers long-term rentals. “On our platform, you can rent up to six months,” she said. “On competitor platforms, it’s daily rentals. So it gets really expensive if you want to rent for a couple-week vacation. Or maybe you want a winter jacket for the season.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Rax announced its first foray into the U.S. market. Alles said she had been a huge fan of TechCrunch and applied for the Battlefield competition, where she later won the top consumer pitch in the competition.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alles said she was surprised to win. “There were so many companies that had like thousands or hundreds of thousands of users; raised [like] $20 million in my category, and one [had] the lead actors from [the show] Silicon Valley,” she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, she found the experience “awesome.” Alles went up to every startup booth to introduce herself to other founders, and also attended some sessions as well as partook in networking. Actually, that was one of the biggest lessons she said she’s learned as a founder — the importance of in-person interaction, because it helps her connect with the community better.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now that Disrupt has passed, Alles said the company hopes to continue its expansion across New York and start building out a rental service platform to offer fashion designers and retailers looking to offer rental clothing to consumers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have the technology, we have the audience,” she said, adding that brands are also looking at ways to become more sustainable, and companies like Rax let them do it. “I think things are getting better and people are becoming more aware of their impact.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to show that Pickle operates nationwide. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is piloting IG for TV, a new experience that lets you watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/youtube-tops-disney-and-netflix-in-tv-viewing-nielsen-finds/\">largely dominates the TV space</a>. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don’t have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reels will also play automatically, so you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch what’s next. You still have the option to skip to the next Reel. You can like, view comments, and re-share reels.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076394\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IG-FOR-TV-SEARCH-1_16_9.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Instagram</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users have the option to pair IG for TV with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home.

The company on Monday said the Apple TV app for Android will now support Google Cast functionality, which lets users stream videos and audio directly to their TV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant’s adoption of Google Cast signals its interest in making Apple TV a more competitive streaming service at a time when the market is seeing increased consolidation. Netflix and Paramount are fighting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\">to acquire Warner Bros.

A Pornhub spokesperson, who did not provide their full name, did not answer questions sent by TechCrunch about the incident, referring us instead to the company’s published statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for the ShinyHunters gang told TechCrunch that the hackers have sent an extortion email only to Pornhub so far, and declined to say how many other companies were part of the Mixpanel incident. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right before the U.S. holiday of Thanksgiving, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/a-data-breach-at-analytics-giant-mixpanel-leaves-a-lot-of-open-questions/\">Mixpanel revealed a breach</a> that it discovered on November 8, which affected its corporate customers, without saying which ones, nor how they were affected. OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/mixpanel-incident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">later confirmed</a> it was one of those affected customers, as well as CoinTracker and SwissBorg.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Mixpanel’s website, the company has around 8,000 customers, with each customer having potentially millions of users whose data was taken in the breach.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about the Mixpanel breach? Such as what companies were affected? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The type of data stolen likely depends on how each customer configured their Mixpanel account to collect data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Generally speaking, companies use Mixpanel to track what their users do on their site or apps, similar to an app developer or website owner watching over a user’s shoulder to learn what they click, view, or swipe. Mixpanel can also log information about the user’s devices, such as the size of the screen, whether they are on Wi-Fi or a cellular network, and the name of the carrier, among other data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a coalition of primarily English-speaking hackers who are believed to be in Western countries. The hackers have a long history of data breaches and are responsible for some of the largest hacks this year, including data thefts targeting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/hacking-group-claims-theft-of-1-billion-records-from-salesforce-customer-databases/\">Salesforce</a> and Gainsight customers, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/google-says-hackers-stole-data-from-200-companies-following-gainsight-breach/\">which affected hundreds of companies</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also on Friday, SoundCloud <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/playbook-articles/protecting-our-users-and-our-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed</a> that about 20% of its users were affected by “unauthorized activity in an ancillary service dashboard,” likely referring to Mixpanel. The audio streaming giant said the stolen data includes email addresses and “information already visible on public SoundCloud profiles.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SoundCloud did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
