The buds cost $199 and will come with a year-long subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also trying to compete with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/the-best-ai-powered-dictation-apps-of-2025/\">AI-powered voice dictation apps</a> such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monolouge, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI’s transcription model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle’s co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was speaking in a whispering tone. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-a-ring-to-take-voice-notes-and-control-music/\">Sandbar</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/\">Pebble</a> launched rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with app, it wants to provide functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can place a pre-order of these buds using <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://subtle.co\">the startup’s site</a>. The Voicebuds are available in black and white colorways. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subtle has raised <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://subtle.co\">$6 million in funding to date</a>, and has been working with consumer companies like Qualcomm and Nothing to deploy their models for noise isolation. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Amazon founder sold 25 million shares for $5.7 billion in June and July, right around the time he was getting hitched to Lauren Sanchez in Venice. Oracle’s former CEO Safra Catz wasn’t far behind at $2.5 billion, followed by Michael Dell at $2.2 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia’s Jensen Huang watched his company become the world’s first $5 trillion business, and sold $1 billion along the way. Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal cashed out nearly $1 billion as demand for the company’s high-speed networking gear soared and her personal net worth crossed $6 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most of these sales happened through pre-arranged trading plans that executives file in advance; they weren’t spur-of-the-moment decisions. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg sold $945 million through his foundation, while Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora and Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt each pocketed over $700 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The common thread was an AI-fueled rally that kept pushing tech stocks higher throughout the year.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The Delete Act, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-09-14/california-bill-delete-online-personal-data\">passed in 2023</a>, was supposed to simplify things, allowing residents to make a single request that more than 500 registered data brokers delete their information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.ca.gov/drop/\">Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform</a> (DROP) actually gives residents the ability to make that request. Once DROP users verify that they are California residents, they can submit a deletion request that will go to all current and future data brokers registered with the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that doesn’t necessarily mean that all your data will be deleted immediately. Brokers are supposed to start processing requests in August 2026, then they have 90 days to actually process requests and report back. If they don’t delete your data, you’ll have the option to submit additional information that may help them locate your records.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies will also be able to keep first-party data that they’ve collected from users. It’s only brokers who seek to buy or sell that data — which can include your social security number, browsing history, email address, phone number, and more — who will be required to delete it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some information, such vehicle registration and voter records, is exempt from deletion because it comes from public documents. Other information, such as sensitive medical information, may be covered under other laws like HIPAA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The California Privacy Protection Agency says that in addition to giving residents more control over their data, the tool could result in fewer “unwanted texts, calls, or emails” and also decrease the “risk of identity theft, fraud, AI impersonations, or that your data is leaked or hacked.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The penalty for data brokers who fail to register or fail to delete requested consumer data is $200 per day, plus enforcement costs, according to the agency.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections — legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals — primarily women — to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a <a href=\"https://x.com/priyankac19/status/2006979351217324527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">formal complaint</a> from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-02/grok-posts-sexual-images-of-minors-after-lapses-in-safeguards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">generated sexualized images involving minors</a>, an issue X <a href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/2007006470689214749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acknowledged</a> earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India’s IT and criminal laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government said noncompliance could lead to action against X under India’s IT law and criminal statutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, one of the world’s biggest digital markets, has emerged as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to go in holding platforms responsible for AI-generated content. Any tightening of enforcement in the country could have ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/x-says-will-fight-indian-court-ruling-on-content-takedown-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">content regulation rules in court</a>, arguing that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even as the platform has complied with a majority of blocking directives.

Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered “other models,” a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China’s BYD, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-01/byd-sells-4-6-million-vehicles-in-2025-meets-revised-sales-goal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delivered 2.26 million EVs</a> in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States — although notably not from Chinese automakers, which are barred from selling vehicles in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/tesla-has-its-best-sales-quarter-of-2025-as-ev-tax-credit-expires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">record-breaking</a> 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter — a 29% increase from the previous quarter — as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and toward AI and robotics. Musk’s pitch is there is money to be made in “sustainable abundance,” a catchphrase used throughout the company’s recent <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/master-plan-part-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Master Plan IV</a> that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage, and robotics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And yet, the bulk of Tesla’s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.)  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-investments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has stated</a> that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-billion-dollar-round-club\">The billion-dollar-round club</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>OpenAI: </strong>Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-6-6b-and-is-now-valued-at-157b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$100 million check</a> as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-invest-100-billion-openai-2025-09-22/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$100 billion</a> in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/19/nvidia-says-no-assurance-of-deal-with-openai-after-100-billion-pact.html\">might not follow through</a>, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthropic:</strong> In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/anthropic-ai-azure-microsoft-nvidia.html\">to $10 billion</a> as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Cursor: </strong>In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/coding-assistant-cursor-raises-2-3b-5-months-after-its-previous-round/\">$2.3 billion Series D</a> round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>xAI: </strong>In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-tells-investor-not-invest-five-ai-startups-including-sutskevers-ssi-2024-10-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">invest in any of its rivals</a>. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/25/elon-musks-xai-lands-billions-in-new-cash-to-fuel-ai-ambitions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">December anyway</a>. Nvidia will also invest up to <a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-07/musk-s-xai-nears-20-billion-capital-raise-tied-to-nvidia-chips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$2 billion</a> in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Mistral AI:</strong> Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-raises-1-7-b-to-accelerate-technological-progress-with-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">September</a>.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Reflection AI</strong>: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/reflection-raises-2b-to-be-americas-open-frontier-ai-lab-challenging-deepseek/\">$8 billion</a>. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Thinking Machines Lab</strong>: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$2 billion seed</a> round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Inflection: </strong>One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/29/inflection-ai-lands-1-3b-investment-to-build-more-personal-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.3 billion</a> round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/microsoft-inflection-ai-investors-reid-hoffman-bill-gates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">paying $620 million</a> for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Crusoe: </strong>In October, the chipmaker participated in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.crusoe.ai/resources/newsroom/crusoe-announces-series-e-funding\">$1.4 billion Series E</a> round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D.

That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/nvidia-backed-uk-ai-firm-nscale-raises-1point1-billion-funding-round.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI’s Stargate project</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Wayve: </strong>In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/06/wayve-raises-1-billion-led-by-softbank-to-take-self-driving-to-cars-and-robots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.05 billion round</a> for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/nvidia-eyes-500m-investment-into-self-driving-tech-startup-wayve/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$500 million</a> in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Figure AI: </strong>In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/figure-rides-the-humanoid-robot-hype-wave-to-2-6b-valuation-and-openai-collab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">over $1 billion</a>, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/figure-rides-the-humanoid-robot-hype-wave-to-2-6b-valuation-and-openai-collab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> a $675 million</a> Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Scale AI: </strong>In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/data-labeling-startup-scale-ai-raises-1b-as-valuation-doubles-to-13-8b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1 billion</a> in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/scale-ai-confirms-significant-investment-from-meta-says-ceo-alexandr-wang-is-leaving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$14.3 billion</a> for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-club\">The many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Commonwealth Fusion</strong>: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$863 million funding round</a> in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Cohere</strong>: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/cohere-hits-a-6-8b-valuation-as-investors-amd-nvidia-and-salesforce-double-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$500 million Series D</a>, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Perplexity</strong>: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/perplexity-has-reportedly-closed-a-500m-funding-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$500 million</a> round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/perplexity-reportedly-raised-200m-at-20b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$200 million fundraise</a> in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Poolside: </strong>In October 2024, the<strong> </strong>AI<strong> </strong>coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/ai-coding-startup-poolside-raises-500m-from-ebay-nvidia-and-others/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$500 million</a> led by Bain Capital Ventures.

The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>CoreWeave: </strong>Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/coreweave-a-gpu-focused-cloud-compute-provider-lands-221m-investment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$221 million</a> in funding.

As the name suggests, this latest device is another version of the Pebble smartwatch, but with a rounded screen, giving it a more upscale look. But like other Pebble devices, the new watch is still an affordable purchase at $199.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble keeps its smartwatches’ cost down by limiting what they can do. In the case of the new Pebble Round 2, the device offers basic health and activity tracking, like steps and sleep, but it doesn’t include a heart rate monitor or other features that would make it a fitness or sports watch alternative. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The trade-off is longer battery life — the Pebble Round 2 should last 10 to 14 days before needing a charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pebbles-smartwatch-is-back-pebble-time-2-specs-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recently launched Pebble Time 2</a>, the Pebble Round 2 is the company’s reboot of an older smartwatch. Back in 2015, Pebble launched its first rounded watch with the Pebble Time Round, which the company called the industry’s thinnest smartwatch at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newer version maintains that slim look, at just 8.1 mm in thickness, compared with the original’s 7.5 mm.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079415\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png 2947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=1200,655 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=1280,699 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=430,235 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=720,393 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=900,491 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=800,437 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=1536,839 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=2048,1118 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=668,365 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=1130,617 1130w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=708,387 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_01_Composed.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[The Pebble Time Round] was, by far, one of my favorite Pebbles, but it wasn’t perfect,” said Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky in an interview with TechCrunch. “It had a few things we could improve, most notably being the gigantic bezel around the edge.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make the original rounded watch face, the team had used an octagonal piece of glass with rounded edges that were hidden by a large bezel. But the result was a device that didn’t have a very large screen. Technology has since improved, of course, so the new device’s larger screen allows you to see more text. The updated design looks better, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The touchscreen is now a 1.3″ color e-paper display (260 x 260 pixels at 283 DPI — or twice as many pixels as the original Pebble Time Round). The screen has a backlight, too, so you can see it at night. Under the hood, the Round 2 runs the open source Pebble OS. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079414\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png 3151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=300,102 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=768,261 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=680,231 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=1200,408 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=1280,435 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=430,146 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=720,245 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=900,306 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=800,272 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=1536,523 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=2048,697 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=668,227 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=1440,490 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=708,241 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PR2_Hero_02_Composed_V3.png?resize=50,17 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The watch’s dual microphones, meanwhile, allow for speech input and replying to messages. (This is currently an Android-only feature, because of Apple’s restrictions.

You always know that the bottom button cancels the call. Or if you’re listening to music and you’ve got AirPods in and you don’t want to fiddle with the AirPods or look at your phone, you always know that the center button pauses music.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079412\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-silver-wrist.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The watch also has a stainless steel frame, accelerometer, and magnetometer, and includes a silicone watch band and a Pebble charge dongle.

The approach was computationally expensive, but made possible with GPUs. The result? A decade of hardcore AI research as scientists worked to invent new architectures for different tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That culminated around 2020 when OpenAI launched GPT-3, which showed how simply making the model 100 times bigger unlocks abilities like coding and reasoning without requiring explicit training. This marked the transition into what Kian Katanforoosh, CEO and founder of AI agent platform Workera, calls the “age of scaling”: a period defined by the belief that more compute, more data, and larger transformer models would inevitably drive the next major breakthroughs in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, many researchers think the AI industry is beginning to exhaust the limits of scaling laws and will once again transition into an age of research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yann LeCun, Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/11/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-reportedly-plans-to-leave-to-build-his-own-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">former chief AI scientist</a>, has long argued against the overreliance on scaling, and stressed the need to develop better architectures. And Sutskever said in a recent <a href=\"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">interview</a> that current models are plateauing and pretraining results have flattened, indicating a need for new ideas.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think most likely in the next five years, we are going to find a better architecture that is a significant improvement on transformers,” Katanforoosh said. “And if we don’t, we can’t expect much improvement on the models.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sometimes-less-is-more\">Sometimes less is more</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large language models are great at generalizing knowledge, but many experts say the next wave of enterprise AI adoption will be driven by smaller, more agile language models that can be fine-tuned for domain-specific solutions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fine-tuned SLMs will be the big trend and become a staple used by mature AI enterprises in 2026, as the cost and performance advantages will drive usage over out-of-the-box LLMs,” Andy Markus, AT&amp;T’s chief data officer, told TechCrunch. “We’ve already seen businesses increasingly rely on SLMs because, if fine-tuned properly, they match the larger, generalized models in accuracy for enterprise business applications, and are superb in terms of cost and speed.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve seen this argument before from French open-weight AI startup Mistral: It argues its small <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/mistral-closes-in-on-big-ai-rivals-with-mistral-3-open-weight-frontier-and-small-models/\">models actually perform better</a> than larger models on several benchmarks after fine-tuning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability of SLMs make them ideal for tailored applications where precision is paramount,” said Jon Knisley, an AI strategist at ABBYY, an Austin-based enterprise AI company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Markus thinks SLMs will be key in the agentic era, Knisley says the nature of small models means they’re better for deployment on local devices, “a trend accelerated by advancements in edge computing.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-learning-through-experience\">Learning through experience</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design.png?w=680\" alt=\"Space ship environment created in Marble with text prompt overlayed.

But LLMs don’t really understand the world; they just predict the next word or idea. That’s why many researchers believe the next big leap will come from world models: AI systems that learn how things move and interact in 3D spaces so they can make predictions and take actions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Signs that 2026 will be a big year for world models are multiplying. LeCun left Meta to start his own world model lab and is reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/yann-lecun-confirms-his-new-world-model-startup-reportedly-seeks-5b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">seeking a $5 billion valuation</a>. Google’s DeepMind has been plugging away at Genie and in August launched its latest model that builds real-time interactive general-purpose world models. Alongside demos by startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/decarts-ai-simulates-a-real-time-playable-version-of-minecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Decart</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/odysseys-new-ai-model-streams-3d-interactive-worlds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Odyssey</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs</a> has launched its first commercial world model, Marble. Newcomers like General Intuition in October scored a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/16/general-intuition-lands-134m-seed-to-teach-agents-spatial-reasoning-using-video-game-clips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$134 million seed round</a> to teach agents spatial reasoning, and video generation startup Runway in December released its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/?_thumbnail_id=3075173\">first world model, GWM-1</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While researchers see long-term potential in robotics and autonomy, the near-term impact is likely to be seen first in video games. PitchBook predicts the market for world models in gaming could grow from $1.2 billion between 2022 and 2025 to $276 billion by 2030, driven by the tech’s ability to generate interactive worlds and more lifelike non-player characters. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pim de Witte, founder of General Intuition, told TechCrunch virtual environments may not only reshape gaming, but also become critical testing grounds for the next generation of foundation models.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-agentic-nation\">Agentic nation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents failed to live up to the hype in 2025, but a big reason for that is because it’s hard to connect them to the systems where work actually happens. Without a way to access tools and context, most agents were trapped in pilot workflows. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), a “USB-C for AI” that lets AI agents talk to the external tools like databases, search engines, and APIs, proved the missing connective tissue and is quickly becoming the standard. OpenAI and Microsoft have publicly embraced MCP, and Anthropic recently donated it to the<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/openai-anthropic-and-block-join-new-linux-foundation-effort-to-standardize-the-ai-agent-era/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Linux Foundation’s new Agentic AI Foundation</a>, which aims to help standardize open source agentic tools.

Katanforoosh says next year, we’ll realize that “AI has not worked as autonomously as we thought,” and the conversation will focus more on how AI is being used to augment human workflows, rather than replace them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And I think a lot of companies are going to start hiring,” he added, noting that he expects there to be new roles in AI governance, transparency, safety, and data management. “I’m pretty bullish on unemployment averaging under 4% next year.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People want to be above the API, not below it, and I think 2026 is an important year for this,” de Witte added. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-getting-physical\">Getting physical</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3053042\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235448056.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advancements in technologies like small models, world models, and edge computing will enable more physical applications of machine learning, experts say. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Physical AI will hit the mainstream in 2026 as new categories of AI-powered devices, including robotics, AVs, drones, and wearables start to enter the market,” Vikram Taneja, head of AT&amp;T Ventures, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While autonomous vehicles and robotics are obvious use cases for physical AI that will no doubt continue to grow in 2026, the training and deployment required is still expensive. Wearables, on the other hand, provide a less expensive wedge with consumer buy-in. Smart glasses like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/metas-ai-glasses-can-now-help-you-hear-conversations-better/\">Ray-Ban Meta</a> are starting to ship assistants that can answer questions about what you’re looking at, and new form factors like <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI-powered health rings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">smartwatches</a> are normalizing always-on, on-body inference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Connectivity providers will work to optimize their network infrastructure to support this new wave of devices, and those with flexibility in how they can offer connectivity will be best positioned,” Taneja said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That is, the company believes its market will be people who do a lot of actual work on their devices — meaning messaging, emailing, working with documents, or other things where using a physical keyboard could be an advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it offers a screen for viewing and responding to messages, the Communicator doesn’t provide access to addictive social media apps or games. Instead, the company partnered with the maker of an Android launcher, Niagara Launcher, to provide access to messaging apps and productivity tools like Gmail, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Slack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The phone’s standout feature is its Signal Light, a light-up button on the side of the device that can be customized with different colors and light patterns to indicate when you’ve received messages from certain people, groups, or apps. For instance, you could make messages from VIPs glow purple while chats from WhatsApp are green.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079419\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4.-Signal-light-brings-attention-to-important-messagesjpg.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Clicks</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can press on this button, known as the Prompt Key, to dictate messages when you’re in a text field, or otherwise take a quick voice note, if not.

Risks from extreme weather, input costs, trade disruptions, and biofuel policy shifts continue to weigh on agricultural markets, the World Bank has <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/developmenttalk/risks-and-challenges-in-global-agricultural-markets0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">warned</a>. This leaves businesses exposed to price swings and inventory losses. Nonetheless, Arya.ag says it is navigating the worst of that strain by steering clear of direct commodity bets and using a model that it says helps absorb shocks from downward pricing shifts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2013 by former ICICI Bank executives Prasanna Rao, Anand Chandra, and Chattanathan Devarajan, Arya.ag is built around a simple idea: giving farmers more control over when and to whom they sell their crops. The Noida-based startup offers storage close to farms while allowing farmers to borrow against warehoused grain to meet immediate cash needs and connecting them with a wider pool of buyers — from agri-corporations to processors and millers — helping them avoid the pressure to sell just after harvest, when prices are often weakest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company operates at scale, which sets Arya.ag apart from traditional lenders, banks, and other agribusiness platforms. The startup says it aggregates and stores about $3 billion worth of grain each year — roughly 3% of national output — and facilitates around $1.5 billion in loans annually, while keeping its rate of bad loans (known as gross non-performing assets, or NPAs) below 0.5% despite the recent drop in prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arya.ag lends only a portion of the value of stored grain and tracks prices closely, triggering margin calls when required rather than taking losses itself, Rao said. Borrowers can respond by repaying part of the loan or adding more grain as collateral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re not immune to risks,” Rao told TechCrunch. “But because your lending is completely secured against commodities, it will never happen that the prices will fall by 90%. You already have a margin of 30%, and with your mark to market, you’ve been able to control your NPAs and defaults.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the year ended March 2025, Arya.ag generated net revenue of ₹4.5 billion (around $50 million), with first-half revenue in the current financial year rising about 30% from a year earlier to ₹3 billion ($33.3 million).

The startup generates revenue from farmers for storage, from banks for originating loans against stored grain, and from buyers for facilitating crop sales through its platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Storage remains the largest contributor, accounting for about 50–55% of total revenue, while finance contributes 25–30% and the rest comes from commerce, Rao said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arya.ag disburses more than ₹110 billion (about $1.2 billion) in loans to farmers each year through its platform. Between ₹25 billion and ₹30 billion (roughly $278 million–$333 million) of that comes from its own balance sheet via its non-banking finance arm, Rao said, with the rest originated for partner banks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arya.ag’s loans carry interest rates of about 12.5% to 12.8%, well below the 24% to 36% typically charged by commission agents, Rao said, though higher than bank lending rates of around 11% to 12%. He added that banks generally do not lend in the small, local markets close to farming areas that Arya serves, where loan sizes are a fraction of typical bank tickets and borrowers are often located far from formal branches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup approves loans in under five minutes with disbursements handled almost entirely digitally, Rao said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Technology plays a central role in how Arya.ag manages risk and scale. The startup uses AI to assess grain quality for lending decisions, satellite data to track crop stress before harvest, and airtight, sensor-enabled storage bags that allow farmers to store grain for extended periods even in villages without formal warehouses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Arya.ag plans to use the fresh capital to scale its tech deployments further, including expanding smart farm centers and deploying more digital tools closer to farms. Part of the investment, Rao said, will also go toward strengthening the startup’s blockchain-based system that digitally tracks stored grain, allowing crops used as collateral or sold through the platform to be monitored across lending and trade transactions, alongside continued investment in storage and credit infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the latest capital infusion and improving profitability, Arya.ag is aiming to be IPO-ready in the next 18 to 20 months, Rao said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond India, Arya.ag plans to expand selectively through a software-led model, with some of its technology already deployed in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa. The startup has a headcount of over 1,200 full-time employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Avendus advised Arya.ag for the new financial round.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Whether you’re looking to get one for yourself, buying a last-minute holiday gift, or exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047856\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png 3280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1280,574 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=2048,919 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1375,617 1375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need. </p>\n\n<p

In the initial aftermath of the acquisition, as users fretted over what <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-pay-verified-twitter-misinformation/\">direction</a> Twitter would take, millions of users hopped over to Mastodon, a fellow microblogging site. As time went on, users would also try out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/\">Bluesky</a>, or Instagram’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/threads-now-has-more-than-400-million-monthly-active-users/\">Threads</a> app — but because Mastodon was founded in 2016, it had years to develop its own identity as more than just an alternate Twitter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-mastodon\">What is Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon was founded in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or any other popular social media site, Mastodon is a nonprofit, meaning that, ideally, its goal is to benefit the public, rather than shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon might look like a Twitter clone at first glance, but the underlying system behind the microblogging platform is far more complex. The service is decentralized (no, not in a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/decentralized-finance/\">blockchain</a> way), describing itself as a “federated network which operates in a similar way to email.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you first create your account, you choose a server — similar to how you choose to open an email account on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or wherever — which generates your profile’s address. So, for example, if you sign up for Mastodon via the climate justice server, then your address will be @[your username]@climatejustice.social. But no matter which server you sign up with, you will be able to communicate with users from any other server, just like how Gmail users email Hotmail users and vice versa. However, some servers might have blocked other servers (perhaps if it’s an unsavory group), which would mean you can’t communicate with anyone from the blocked server.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-mastodon-lingo\">The Mastodon lingo</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon users generally refer to individual communities as “<a href=\"https://mastodon.help/instances/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">instances</a>” or servers<strong>. </strong>These Mastodon servers can be run by individuals, groups or organizations that each have their own set of rules regarding how users can sign up, as well as their own moderation policies. Some servers let anyone join, while others are invite-only or require approval by an admin. For example, a server for professional scientists asks applicants to include a link to their research to demonstrate that they are, indeed, professionals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Choosing which server to register your account with might seem stressful, but it’s possible to move your account later, so don’t worry. Plus, you can follow people regardless of which server they’re on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You may also hear Mastodon described as part of the “<a href=\"https://fediverse.party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fediverse</a>,” or an interconnected web of various social media services. You know how having a Twitter account doesn’t mean you can use that account on Instagram? Through the Fediverse, your single Mastodon account also grants you access to other decentralized social networks, if that interests you.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You may ocassionally see Mastodon’s equivalent of tweets being referred to as “toots,” but this is fading out of favor (since it’s kind of silly!). Many people are just calling them “posts” these days, but “toot” is often found referenced in older third-party clients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon supports a number of Twitter conventions like replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hashtags. For a while, Mastodon made <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/99662106175542726\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">an intentional choice</a> not to make a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/mastodon-rolls-out-quote-posts-with-protections-to-prevent-dunking/\">quote tweet-like feature</a>, since it can encourage dogpiling criticism, but the platform relented and rolled out that feature in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span> In addition, Mastodon lists work slightly differently from Twitter as you can only add people to a list if you’re already following them. And Direct messages on Mastodon are just @username posts, not private messages coming to a DM inbox</span> — just remember to change the visibility settings if you want that message to stay between the two of you.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-2437890 size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2437890\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=768,769 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=616,617 616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=530,531 530w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fediverse_branches.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fediverse </a><span class=\"screen-reader-text\"><a href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">(opens in a new window)</a></span></span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/File:Fediverse_branches.png\" target=\"_blank\">Fediverse <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-it-mean-that-mastodon-is-open-source\">What does it mean that Mastodon is open source?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone can download, modify and install Mastodon on their own server — plus, the developers of the platform don’t own the copyright.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That doesn’t mean that you can grab Mastodon’s code without acknowledging the source, though. Former President Donald Trump’s social media platform, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/21/trumps-truth-social-app-launch-store-errors/\">Truth Social</a>, initially <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/\">launched with Mastodon code</a> and passed it off as if it were original software. Mastodon <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">did not take kindly</a> to that.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-create-a-mastodon-account\">How do you create a Mastodon account?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you arrive on the <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mastodon</a> website, you can click a button called “create account,” which directs you to <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a page listing servers to choose from</a>. You can filter these by various factors, like region, language, topic, sign-up speed and more. There, find a server that piques your interest and join — if it’s a server that requires you to be approved, you might need to wait a bit. From there, you can start finding people to follow, regardless of whether they’re registered via your same server.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In effort to minimize confusion on new users picking a server, Mastodon made changes amid the “Twitter exodus” so that it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/mastodon-now-has-a-simpler-sign-up-process/\">easier to create an account</a>. Now, when you go to sign up, it will give an easy option to create an account on mastodon.social instead of choosing a server.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-decide-which-mastodon-server-to-join\">How do you decide which Mastodon server to join?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon’s website has <a href=\"https://mastodon.help/instances/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">helpful resources</a> — but it’s still a bit overwhelming and challenging to find a home base that aligns with your interests. Ask friends who are already on Mastodon if they have suggestions! Or just join somewhere random, because you can always <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">change your server affiliation later</a> once you get into the swing of things.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-you-talk-to-people-on-other-mastodon-servers-besides-your-own\">Can you talk to people on other Mastodon servers besides your own?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, you can follow people outside of your local server and reply to their posts. However, when you want to follow someone on a different server, you have to enter their username in the search box on your server to find them first, then follow them. You can’t just go to their profile and click the follow button as you would on Twitter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-the-difference-between-the-home-local-and-federated-timelines\">What’s the difference between the Home, Local and Federated timelines?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Your Home timeline shows you posts from people that you follow, similar to Twitter. The Local timeline shows posts from all users in your server, while the Federated timeline shows you all public posts from users that people in your server follow. (Hint: You can turn on “Slow Mode” in Preferences –&gt; Appearance to hide timeline updates behind a click if things are coming at you too fast!)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-mastodon-s-moderation-policy\">What is Mastodon’s moderation policy?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Individual server admins set their own moderation policies, so you should read the policy on the server you choose to ensure it matches up with your values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon’s user base is a fraction of a percentage of the size of Twitter’s user base. It’s also far less intuitive to navigate, since it hasn’t been designed for a massive global audience like Twitter. That could change in time as more developers join the project in the wake of the Twitter takeover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, for one thing, Mastodon is not owned by Elon Musk… however, it’s going to be difficult in the near-term for Mastodon to replicate the same “watercooler of the world” vibe that Twitter was defined by. Some users might prefer Mastodon to X, though, as it’s more customizable by nature. Unlike X, individual communities have different content guidelines, which provide a variety of different user experiences. And while the user base on Mastodon is smaller, this can lead to more personal and direct conversations, at times, compared with tweeting into the void, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon is what you make of it. Due to its decentralized nature, if you are looking for a more controlled online experience, you can join a server with stricter guardrails against harassment. Some Mastodon features are also built with mitigating harassment in mind. For example, you can only search by hashtag, not by words that appear in a toot. So if you want your post to be discoverable, you can tag it — if you’d rather limit the audience, no one can find your tweet about the Red Sox by simply searching “red sox” if you haven’t tagged it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, a text-based search can surface the posts you’ve written, favorited, boosted or have been mentioned in, which can be useful.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-post-images-and-video\">Can I post images and video?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As noted above, Mastodon supports many Twitter conventions, but its support for media is more limited. Where Twitter supports a variety of media and other data appended to tweets, including its audio-only social “Spaces,” plus photos, video, GIFs, polls, precise location and experimental “Status” tags, Mastodon simply supports images, videos, audio and polls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can<a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@feditips/106228763469320167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> add up to four images to a post</a>, up to eight megabytes in size. Video and audio can be any length, but with a file size limit of 40 megabytes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-post-privately-to-friends\">Can I post privately to friends?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon offers the ability to set your post’s privacy at the time of writing. Posts can be set to be public to be visible by all; unlisted to make them public but opted out of discovery features; only visible to your followers; or only visible to those users you’ve mentioned.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-i-get-verified-on-mastodon\">Can I get verified on Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. There’s no universal verification system like on Twitter. Some servers may vet their user sign-ups and you can self-verify, in a way, by adding links to your Mastodon profile that have a specific attribute (rel=”me”) in order to prove you are who you say you are.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some servers are having fun with the idea of verification in a less-than-official fashion. For example, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@stux@mstdn.social/109268107226097074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the mstdn.social server lets you add blue-and-white checkmarks</a> and other emoji to your display name if you’d like, which make you look verified, even though these don’t mean anything. (Sort of like Twitter’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/05/twitter-begins-rolling-out-7-99-twitter-blue-plan-with-verification-fewer-ads/\">new verification system</a>! But for free!)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-image-2438206\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2438206\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg 1156w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=430,294 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=720,492 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=900,615 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=800,547 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=668,457 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=549,375 549w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=903,617 903w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=708,484 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-07-at-4.53.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@stux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">@stux@mstdn.social <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mastodon.social/@stux\" target=\"_blank\">mastodon.social/@stux <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-mastodon-here-to-stay\">Is Mastodon here to stay?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of summer 2025, Mastodon has under one million monthly active users, and around 10 million registered users — this is to say, Mastodon is much smaller than X which had an estimated 132 million daily active users. Still, not all social networks are created equal, and you might find that you prefer tooting about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TTRPGs</a> in a dedicated server, as opposed to tweeting into a realm of madness. Or, you might find that this decentralized system is confusing, and you’ll just ride out the Muskening on X, or switch to Bluesky, Threads, or something else entirely. Choose your own adventure!</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-i-m-not-sure-i-want-to-leave-x-can-i-cross-post-from-x-to-mastodon\">I’m not sure I want to leave X. Can I cross-post from X to Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, this is possible by way of third-party tools. These require you to authorize your account with Twitter and Mastodon and set up parameters. We’ve had success with <a href=\"https://moa.party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Moa Party</a>, which allows you to get specific as to which tweets or retweets are cross-posted. But other tools are available, including <a href=\"https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mastodon Twitter Crossposter</a>, which is also available here on <a href=\"https://github.com/renatolond/mastodon-twitter-poster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, this is also possible with third-party tools. We’ve seen many Mastodon users trying out tools like <a href=\"https://fedifinder.glitch.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fedifinder</a>, <a href=\"https://twitodon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Twitodon</a> and <a href=\"https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Debirdify</a>, for example.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-mastodon-work-with-bluesky-and-threads\">Does Mastodon work with Bluesky and Threads?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a no for Bluesky — not unless <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-app-trying-to-replace-twitter/\">Bluesky</a> chooses to adopt the ActivityPub protocol Mastodon uses. But Bluesky is not planning to integrate with ActivityPub, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1511811083954102273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">having decided to build its own</a> networking protocol. There is some <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33252108\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">skepticism</a> among the developer and open source community about whether or not Bluesky’s decision to go its own way is really about its own protocol’s advantages or if it’s more about producing a spec it could eventually control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Threads, however, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/21/networking-traffic/threads-has-entered-the-fediverse/\">supports</a> ActivityPub.

That’s roughly 10% of the workforce at 35 major banks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bloodletting will hit hardest in back-office operations, risk management, and compliance, the unglamorous guts of banking where algorithms are believed capable of tearing through spreadsheets faster and more effectively than humans.

According to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ramps-audio-ai-efforts-ahead-device?rc=omehqc\">new reporting</a> from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed — toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Smart speakers have already made voice assistants a fixture in more than a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.technavio.com/report/smart-home-speaker-market-industry-in-us-analysis\">third</a> of U.S. homes. Meta just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/metas-ai-glasses-can-now-help-you-hear-conversations-better/\">rolled out a feature</a> for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms — essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/google-tests-audio-overviews-for-search-queries/\">Audio Overviews</a>” that transform search results into conversational summaries, and Tesla is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-is-coming-to-tesla-vehicles-next-week-says-elon-musk/\">integrating</a> xAI’s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to create a conversational voice assistant that handles everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not just the tech giants placing this bet. A motley crew of startups has emerged with the same conviction, albeit with varying degrees of success. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">cautionary tale</a>.

And now at least two companies, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/\">Sandbar</a> and one helmed by Pebble founder <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/?_thumbnail_id=3073860\">Eric Migicovsky</a>, are building AI rings expected to debut in 2026, allowing wearers to literally talk to the hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The form factors may differ, but the thesis is the same: audio is the interface of the future. Every space — your home, your car, even your face — is becoming a control surface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you’re talking, which is something today’s models can’t manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of this is hugely surprising. As The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI’s hardware efforts through the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">$6.5 billion acquisition</a> in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to “right the wrongs” of past consumer gadgets.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although iconic founders like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg famously didn’t finish college, multiple <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w24489#:~:text=of%20Economic%20Research.-,Pierre%20Azoulay%2C%20Benjamin%20Jones%2C%20J.,Daniel%20KimJavier%20Miranda\">studies</a> <span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://endeavor.org/stories/unicorn-founder-pathways/\" target=\"_blank\">show</a> that the vast majority of successful startups had founders with bachelor’s or <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/edtech/unicorn-founder-myth-education-matters-strebulaev-stanford/#:~:text=They%20are%206x%20more%20likely,person%20over%2025%20years%20old.\" target=\"_blank\">graduate</a></span> degrees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite this data, the appeal of a dropout founder persists, though VC enthusiasm for the ‘un-degreed’ is far from constant. It is a phenomenon that cycles in and out of fashion, and right now it is certainly having a moment amid the AI boom.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This trend is particularly evident during Y Combinator <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/the-9-most-sought-after-startups-from-yc-demo-day/\">Demo Days</a>, where founders are increasingly touting their dropout status in their one-minute pitches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t believe YC formally tracks dropout status but, anecdotally, in recent batches, I was struck by how many founders highlight being a dropout from college, grad school, and even high school,” said Katie Jacobs Stanton, founder and general partner <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/moxxie-ventures-led-by-ex-twitter-media-head-raises-95m-third-fund/\">of Moxxie Ventures</a>. “Being a dropout is a kind of credential in itself, reflecting a deep conviction and commitment to building. I think it’s perceived as something quite positive in the venture ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young, most still opted to stay for the diploma. For instance, Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor, graduated from MIT, and Cognition co-founder Scott Wu graduated from Harvard. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet despite these examples, a growing number of aspiring entrepreneurs fear that staying to graduate means missing the most critical window of the AI building cycle. Some, like Brendan Foody, who co-founded Mercor, have famously dropped out of prestigious schools like Georgetown to pursue their startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Kulveer Taggar, founder of the YC-focused venture firm Phosphor Capital, told TechCrunch: “There’s just this sense of urgency and maybe FOMO.” There is a calculation right now: “I can finish my degree, or I can just start building.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This fear is leading to extreme cases. One professor at an elite university recently described a student walking away from his degree in his final semester. That student was convinced that having a diploma would actually hurt his chances of getting funded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some founders fear that a diploma could be a negative signal, Yuri Sagalov, who leads General Catalyst’s seed strategy, suggests that VCs are less fixated on the dropout label, especially for students close to graduating: “I don’t think I’ve ever felt any different about someone who graduated or didn’t graduate when they’re in [their] fourth year and drop out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though self-taught tech prodigies can build startups without a formal education, Sagalov argues that there’s still value in the social network that a university creates and the brand of the university, even if the founder doesn’t receive a diploma.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">‘You get a lot of the social value… because you can put the fact that you participated,’ Sagalov said. “Most people will look you up on LinkedIn and not care as much whether you finished or not.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many investors now believe founders can forego a university degree, not all VCs agree that young founders have an edge in this market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wesley Chan, co-founder of FPV Ventures, isn’t as eager to invest in dropouts because he prioritizes a trait most young founders haven’t developed yet: wisdom. Chan believes that wisdom is typically found in “older founders or people who have a couple of scars under their belt.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
