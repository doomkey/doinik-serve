The company said that it will offer more than 10 different plans to choose from, all priced below the $82.99 per month main YouTube TV plan that has access to more than 100 networks. The new plans will start rolling out this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While that main plan will not go away, the new plans will allow customers to pick what matters most and what they could do without in return for cost savings. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090976\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg 1302w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=1200,868 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=1280,926 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=430,311 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=720,521 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=900,651 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=800,579 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=668,483 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=518,375 518w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=853,617 853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=708,512 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/youtube-tv-custom-plans.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">YouTube</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among the new plans are a $64.99 per month Sports plan, a Sports + News plan for $71.99 per month, a less expensive Entertainment plan for $54.99 per month, and a $69.99 per month News + Entertainment + Family plan, which includes kids’ content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Sports plans include all major broadcasters, plus networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, all of the ESPN networks, and ESPN Unlimited. This plan is $18 cheaper per month than the main plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube TV’s news channels include CNBC, Fox News, CNN, MS NOW, and Bloomberg, along with other national news channels. Combined with Sports, the package is priced $11 lower per month than the main YouTube TV plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entertainment only plan is $28 cheaper per month than the main plan, and includes major broadcasters as well as FX, Hallmark, Comedy Central, Bravo, Paramount, Food Network, and HGTV. Families with small kids can add on other channels like Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, National Geographic, Cartoon Network, and PBS Kids for a bit more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also offering discounts for new subscribers, which could lower the price of certain plans further for either the first few months or the first year. Subscribers will continue to have access to YouTube TV’s unlimited DVR, support for up to six family members on one account, multiview, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other add-ons like NFL Sunday Ticket + RedZone, HBO Max, and 4K Plus can also be purchased to customize plans further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says all the new plans will roll out over the next several weeks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customized packages are now not a new idea in streaming — a la carte options were a key part of the early streaming pioneer Sling TV’s initial offering, for instance. This element of personalization was also one of the factors that was meant to make streaming a better alternative to traditional pay TV, where consumers often ended up paying for channels they didn’t want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as streamers added more content, networks, and, in particular, sports programming, the cost of streaming inched back up to compete with cable and linear television. Live TV streamers like YouTube TV may have offered convenience and some savings over still <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cordcuttersnews.com/average-cost-of-cable-tv-climbs-to-over-over-147-a-month-over-1700-a-year-as-cord-cutting-grows/\">more expensive cable</a>, but it wasn’t exactly affordable anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These new packages hit the market at a time when consumer confidence is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-confidence-slumps-january-level-last-seen-2014-2026-01-27/\">at its lowest in more than 11 years,</a> due to fears about the labor market and higher prices, which have made consumers more cautious about their spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

All users will be put into a “teen-appropriate experience” by default unless they prove they’re adults. Age verification will be required to change certain settings and access age-restricted content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord users will need to be confirmed as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting, and only adults can access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands. Additionally, messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and only verified adults can modify this setting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know, and only adults will be able speak on stage in servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To complete age verification, users need to either complete a facial age estimation or submit an ID to Discord’s vendor partners. The platform plans to add more options in the future. Discord notes that some users may be asked to use multiple methods when additional information is needed to assign an age group.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The facial age estimation requires video selfies, which Discord says never leave your device. Additionally, the company says IDs submitted to its vendor partners are deleted quickly, and in most cases, immediately after age confirmation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that Discord <a href=\"https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service?ref=404media.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a> last October that around 70,000 users may have had sensitive data, such as their government ID photos, exposed after hackers breached a third-party vendor that the platform uses for age-related appeals. The breach reflected <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/eff-fifth-circuit-age-verification-laws-will-hurt-more-they-help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">digital rights activists’ concerns</a> over the use of age checks as a way to make the internet “safer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord’s global launch of age verification follows the company’s decision to <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/33362401287959-What-s-Changing-for-UK-and-Australian-Users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">establish age checks</a> for users in the U.K. and Australia last year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility,” said Savannah Badalich, head of product policy at Discord, in a press release. “We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement mirrors similar moves made by other online platforms, reflecting growing international efforts to strengthen child safety. Most recently, Roblox introduced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/roblox-now-requires-all-users-globally-to-complete-age-checks-to-access-chat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mandatory facial verification</a> for access to chats on its platform. Last July, YouTube <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/youtube-rolls-out-age-estimatation-tech-to-identify-u-s-teens-and-apply-additional-protections/\">launched its age-estimation</a> technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in order to provide a more age-appropriate experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord’s age-verification changes will begin in early March, and both new and existing users will need to verify their age to access age-restricted content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The ride-hailing giant will also pay $100 million for a 15% stake in Getir’s grocery, retail and water delivery business, and said it would complete the acquisition of the division over the next few years.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber is buying the business from Getir’s biggest shareholder, the Emirati sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The investment firm was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/mubadala-explores-selling-all-getir-stakes-turkey-sources-say-2025-09-19/\">reportedly</a> seeking to sell its stake in the company last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal comes after a turbulent few years for Getir, which once enjoyed a valuation of $12 billion, that saw the startup scale down its operations massively. The company launched to great traction in 2015, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/\">invested aggressively</a> to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/getir-weezy-acquisition/\">expand</a> its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/07/getir-freshdirect/\">operations</a> in the U.S. and Europe, both organically and via acquisitions, especially during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But after the pandemic lockdowns eased, broader consumer demand for food and grocery delivery also wavered, and Getir chose to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/getir-getout-instant-delivery/\">cut its losses</a> in 2024, shutting shop and laying off thousands of staff in the U.S., U.K, and Europe in order to focus on business back home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nearly a year ago, the company went through a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/mubadala-proposal-turkeys-getir-prompts-founders-plan-legal-move-2025-01-15/\">struggle for control</a> over a restructuring plan proposed by Mubadala. The plan was opposed by one of Getir’s co-founders, who eventually sued to fight the “illegal coup,” but a Dutch court rejected the founder’s appeals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised a total of $2.40 billion so far, according to PitchBook. Documents <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/details?id=ECLI:NL:GHAMS:2025:280&amp;showbutton=true&amp;keyword=getir&amp;idx=5\">filed</a> by Getir in court last year show the company valued its group assets at $374 million.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This transaction reflects the strength of the business and the progress it has made, particularly over the last year,” Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, deputy group CEO at Mubadala, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber said it would combine the new unit’s services with Trendyol Go, a food and grocery delivery service in Turkey that the ride-hail giant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/uber-eats-comes-to-turkey-via-700m-trendyol-go-acquisition/\">bought</a> for $700 million last May. Uber said Getir’s food delivery business alone recorded gross bookings of more than $1 billion in 2025, up 50% from a year earlier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal follows a strong showing by Uber’s delivery business in the fourth quarter, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/fcda6930-c9b5-4ab5-bb64-9b621c2ca8a5.pdf\">reporting</a> revenue of $4.89 billion, up 30% from a year earlier.

That’s the VC firm founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Gather team first met Smith Point a year ago at a logistics conference, and “it took Keith and his team five minutes to get what we’re doing,” co-founder and CEO Sankalp Arora told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gather.ai/\">Gather AI</a> is doing is unusual. The three founders met as PhD students at Carnegie Mellon University, where they built one of the first autonomous helicopters and tested it on the FBI training grounds in Quantico. (Block is a trustee for CMU.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2017, the founders took what they learned about teaching helicopters to fly and land safely and launched Gather AI. Using off-the-shelf cameras placed on strategic moving equipment like forklifts, as well as off-the-shelf drones flying around the warehouse, the cameras watch on-the-floor operations and log what they find into the warehouse management systems.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the catch is, the AI isn’t being random about what it scans. It is being “curious,” as Arora described it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My PhD work focused on how to make different kinds of flying robots curious,” he said. “So they’re curious about boxes and bar codes and workflows.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to barcodes, they look for lot codes, text, expiration dates, case counts, damages, occupancy, and other items. The idea is that they will discover and predict issues like low inventory, misplaced stock, and workflows that may cause safety issues. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also work in environments unfriendly to people, like freezers and cold storage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because Gather’s underlying tech was built years before the age of large language models, this is not the kind of AI that an LLM uses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re not end-to-end neural networks,” Arora explains. “They are classical Bayesian techniques, combined with neural networks.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI vision Bayesian techniques use probability-base methods to teach computers how to interpret visual data. These systems allow the technology to learn by using data and prior knowledge to make decisions — meaning they don’t suffer the hallucination problems of LLMs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead they “get curious,” as Arora put it, to gather information (hence the startup’s name) and make a decision on the next action based on what they’ve learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As old-school as that sounds, Gather AI is sitting at the edge of the next big thing in AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/ai-researchers-embodied-an-llm-into-a-robot-and-it-started-channeling-robin-williams/\">sometimes called “embodied AI.”</a> These are robots that interact with the real world, as opposed to an LLM interacting via computer chat or web app.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To that end, in December, the startup won the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nebius.com/newsroom/nebius-debuts-the-robotics-and-physical-ai-awards-and-summit-to-support-next-generation-startups-with-1-5-million-in-compute-credits\">2025 Nebius Robotics</a> award for Vision AI and Streaming Video Analytics. (Nebius is a Netherlands company that provides AI infrastructure.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gather currently employs about 60 people, Arora said, and customers include Kwik Trip, Axon, GEODIS, and NFI Industries. With this fresh funding, the startup has now raised $74 million total. Other investors include Bain Capital Ventures, XRC Ventures, and Hillman Investments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Previously, CarInsurance.com held the crown at $49.7 million (2010), followed by VacationRentals.com ($35 million in 2007) and Voice.com ($30 million in 2019). Other eye-popping sales include PrivateJet.com ($30 million), 360.com ($17 million), and Sex.com, which has sold twice for over $13 million each time, though its second owner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90332346/how-the-epic-feud-over-the-rights-to-the-sex-com-domain-ended-with-the-ultimate-deception\">went bankrupt </a>trying to monetize it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes,” Fischer told the FT. “When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether these mega-dollar domains actually deliver returns remains an open question. But for Marszalek, who already owns Crypto.com and dropped $700 million on stadium naming rights, owning two category-defining domains is apparently worth the outlay.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

More than that, I was baffled why anyone would spend time and money on something that seemed guaranteed to outrage cinephiles while offering negligible commercial value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/09/deepfaking-orson-welless-mangled-masterpiece\">an in-depth profile by the New Yorker’s Michael Schulman</a> provides more details about the project. If nothing else, it helps explain why the startup Fable and its founder Edward Saatchi are pursuing it: It seems to come from a genuine love of Welles and his work.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saatchi (whose father was a founder of advertising firm Saatchi &amp; Saatchi) recalled a childhood of watching films in a private screening room with his “movie mad” parents. He said he first saw “Ambersons” when he was twelve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The profile also explains why “Ambersons,” while much less famous than Welles’ first film “Citizen Kane,” remains so tantalizing — Welles himself claimed it was a “much better picture” than “Kane,” but after a disastrous preview screening, the studio cut 43 minutes from the film, added an abrupt and unconvincing happy ending, and eventually destroyed the excised footage to make space in its vaults.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“To me, this is the holy grail of lost cinema,” Saatchi said. “It just seemed intuitively that there would be some way to undo what had happened.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saatchi is only the latest Welles devotee to dream of recreating the lost footage. In fact, Fable is working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who already spent years trying to achieve the same thing with animated scenes based on the movie’s script and photographs, and on Welles’ notes. (Rose said that after he screened the results for friends and family, “a lot of them were scratching their heads.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So while Fable is using more advanced technology — filming scenes in live action, then eventually overlaying them with digital recreations of the original actors and their voices — this project is best understood as a slicker, better-funded version of Rose’s work. It’s a fan’s attempt to glimpse Welles’ vision.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, while the New Yorker article includes a few clips of Rose’s animations, as well as images of Fable’s AI actors, there’s no footage showing the results of Fable’s live action-AI hybrid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the company’s own admission, there are significant challenges, whether that’s fixing obvious blunders like a two-headed version of the actor Joseph Cotten, or the more subjective task of recreating the complex beauty of the film’s cinematography. (Saatchi even described a “happiness” problem, with the AI tending to make the film’s women look inappropriately happy.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for whether this footage will ever be released to the public, Saatchi admitted it was “a total mistake” not to speak to Welles’ estate before his announcement. Since then, he has reportedly been working to win over both the estate and Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the film. Welles’ daughter Beatrice told Schulman that while she remains “skeptical,” she now believes “they are going into this project with enormous respect toward my father and this beautiful movie.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The actor and biographer Simon Callow — who’s currently writing the fourth book in his multi-volume Welles biography — has also agreed to advise the project, which he described as a “great idea.” (Callow is a family friend of the Saatchis.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But not everyone has been convinced. Melissa Galt said her mother, the actress Anne Baxter, would “not have agreed with that at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s not the truth,” Galt said. “It’s a creation of someone else’s truth. But it’s not the original, and she was a purist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while I’ve become more sympathetic to Saatchi’s aims, I still agree with Galt: At its best, this project will only result in a novelty, a dream of what the movie might have been.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, Galt’s description of her mother’s position that “once the movie was done, it was done,” reminded me of a recent essay in which the writer Aaron Bady <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oaklandreviewofbooks.org/sinners-one-battle-after-another-greatness-death/\">compared AI to the vampires in “Sinners.”</a> Bady argued that when it comes to art, both vampires and AI will always come up short, because “what makes art possible” is a knowledge of mortality and limitations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is no work of art without an ending, without the point at which the work ends (even if the world continues),” he wrote, adding, “Without death, without loss, and without the space between my body and yours, separating my memories from yours, we cannot make art or desire or feeling.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In that light, Saatchi’s insistence that there <em>must</em> be “some way to undo what had happened” feels, if not outright vampiric, then at least a little childish in its unwillingness to accept that some losses are permanent. It may not, perhaps, be all that different from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/deadbots-ai-grief-obsolete/685811/\">a startup founder claiming they can make grief obsolete</a> — or a studio executive insisting that “The Magnificent Ambersons” needed a happy ending.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Alphabet-owned self-driving company now operates commercial robotaxi services in six markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, and Miami. It has plans to grow its fleet of driverless taxicabs this year to more than a dozen new cities internationally, including London and Tokyo. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And now it has <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-to-scale-robotaxi-fleet-london-tokyo/\">$16 billion</a> to fuel that expansion. Is it enough? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Talking to a few industry watchers, the answer kept landing in the squishy “sort of” and “it depends” territory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First the bull case. Alphabet is clearly committed to ensuring Waymo’s success; the parent company is, and continues to be, the primary investor. Which means Waymo isn’t exposed like other AV startups that suddenly lost funding after their backers (often legacy automakers) got skittish or pivoted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its ridership and autonomous miles driven stats are also exploding and will likely continue in that trajectory unless it is derailed by regulators. (Waymo provides 400,000 rides every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas, and in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This doesn’t guarantee success, though, especially if the gauge is set to profitability. Waymo still must solve several problems, including cost and increasing attention from regulators (the company’s chief safety officer just testified in a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/?modal=short-chief-safety-officer-dr-mauricio-pena-testimony\">Senate Commerce hearing</a>). If Waymo wants to simply be the licensor of its AV tech, it will have to move away from being the operator, which means giving up some control.

He had connections to Prince Andrew but was otherwise a ghost.<br><br>He was on my mind, though, as the Department of Justice started releasing its files on <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>. My curiosity as to whether he would turn up in the documents was quickly overwhelmed by the fact that he was, in fact, a close business partner of the convicted sex offender. He brought Epstein investment opportunities from around the world, and in particular, pitched him on investing in <strong>Faraday Future</strong>, <strong>Lucid Motors</strong>, and Canoo during the go-go days of mobility funding. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/prince-andrew-advisor-pitched-jeffrey-epstein-on-investing-in-ev-startups-like-lucid-motors/\">Read my story</a> on Stern and Epstein’s relationship and how mobility startups were once in the mix.<br><br><em>— Sean O’Kane</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

Many startup founders are applying the AV systems they’ve developed to other use cases, including off-road defense, trucking, forklifts, mining, and construction. Investors, anxious about missing out on the AV party, are jumping into these sectors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Bedrock Robotics</strong> is the latest example of investor interest. The Silicon Valley autonomous vehicle technology startup, founded by veterans of Waymo and Segment, are developing a self-driving system that can be retrofitted onto construction equipment. And it just raised $270 million in Series B funding co-led by CapitalG and the Valor Atreides AI Fund. Other investors include Xora, 8VC, Eclipse, Emergence Capital, Perry Creek Capital, NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm), Tishman Speyer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Georgian, Incharge Capital, C4 Ventures, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bedrock raised more than $350 million in a short time (the company was formed in 2024). And while that might not seem like a lot compared to the size of some seed rounds in the AI labs sector, it shows money is flowing into physical AI startups. I expect more deal flow; importantly I expect the startups focused on practical applications of automated driving systems to attract talent — if they can afford them. Bedrock, for instance, hired Vincent Gonguet, who previously led AI safety and alignment at Meta for all Llama models, as its head of evaluation. It also hired John Chu away from Waymo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Keep an eye out for my interview with Bedrock Robotics co-founder and CEO <strong>Boris Sofman</strong>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week …</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">German electric motor maker <strong>Additive Drives</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://techfundingnews.com/additive-drives-25m-nordic-alpha-rare-earth-motors/\">raised €25 million</a> ($29.5 million) from Nordic Alpha Partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autonomous underwater vehicles startup <strong>Apeiron Labs</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/apeiron-labs-gets-95m-to-flood-the-oceans-with-autonomous-underwater-robots/\">closed a $9.5 million</a> Series A round led by Dyne Ventures, RA Capital Management Planetary Health, and S2G Investments.

The ruling, published by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, says all new cars sold in the country must have mechanical releases on their door handles by January 1, 2027. There is chatter that Europe could soon follow. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Uber</strong> continues to make moves designed to make it competitive in the autonomous vehicle sector. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/uber-appoints-new-cfo-as-its-av-plans-accelerate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has promoted</a><strong> Balaji Krishnamurthy</strong>, its VP of strategic finance and investor relations, to be its CFO. This may not seem connected to AVs, but it is. Krishnamurthy actively promotes the company’s autonomous ride-hailing partnerships and has a board seat at AV company Waabi. During the company’s Q4 call, he talked about AVs, saying the company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, a high-profile lawsuit against <strong>Uber</strong> has delivered a mixed verdict for the ride-hailing company, which was sued after a woman alleged she was raped by her Uber driver in November 2023. A jury determined Uber was liable as an apparent agent of the driver and awarded $8.5 million to the plaintiff. The jury rejected claims that Uber was liable for negligence or design defects and declined to award punitive damages. An Uber spokesperson, who emailed TechCrunch a statement, said the “verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety. We will continue to put safety at the heart of everything we do.” Uber plans to appeal the decision. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One more thing …</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week in our newsletter, we did a poll asking what the name or ticker of <strong>Elon Musk</strong>’s combined supercompany should be. Thanks to those who emailed their suggestions, many of which had space themes, like Galactic X (great one). As for the poll, the majority picked plain ol’ X. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That makes sense, considering Musk has often talked, and posted, about X, the everything app. About 50% voted for X, while 20.7% picked ELON, 17.2% selected SpaceAI, and 12.1% chose K2, a reference to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\">one of the corporate entities</a> created in January. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My pick?

Because of that India is adjusting its startup rules, and mobilizing public capital, hoping to help more of them make it to commercial products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This week, the Indian government <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2224069\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">updated</a> its startup framework, doubling the period for which deep tech companies are treated as startups to 20 years and raising the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant, and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.12 million), from ₹1 billion (around $11.04 million) previously. The change aims to align policy timelines with the long development cycles typical of science- and engineering-led businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change also forms part of New Delhi’s effort to build a long-horizon deep tech ecosystem by combining regulatory reform with public capital, including the ₹1 trillion (around $11 billion) Research, Development and Innovation Fund (RDI), announced last year. That fund is intended to expand patient financing for science-led and R&amp;D-driven companies. Against that backdrop, U.S. and Indian venture firms later came together to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/u-s-and-indian-vcs-just-formed-a-1b-alliance-to-fund-indias-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launch the India Deep Tech Alliance</a>, $1 billion-plus private investor coalition that includes Accel, Blume Ventures, Celesta Capital, Premji Invest, Ideaspring Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, and Kalaari Capital, with chipmaker <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nvidia acting as an adviser</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For founders, these changes may fix what some see as an artificial pressure point. Under the previous framework,  companies often risked losing startup status while still pre-commercial, creating a “false failure signal” that judged science-led ventures on policy timelines rather than technological progress, said Vishesh Rajaram, founding partner at Speciale Invest, an Indian deep tech venture capital firm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By formally recognizing deep tech as different, the policy reduces friction in fundraising, follow-on capital, and engagement with the state, which absolutely shows up in a founder’s operating reality over time,” Rajaram told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, investors say access to capital remains a more binding constraint, particularly beyond the early stages. “The biggest gap has historically been funding depth at Series A and beyond, especially for capital-intensive deep tech companies,” Rajaram said. That is where the government’s earlier <a href=\"https://rdifund.anrf.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">RDI fund</a> is meant to play a complementary role.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The real benefit of the RDI framework is to increase the funding available to deep tech companies at early and growth stages,” said Arun Kumar, managing partner at Celesta Capital. By routing public capital through venture funds with tenors similar to private capital, he said, the fund is designed to address chronic gaps in follow-on funding without altering the commercial criteria that govern private investment decisions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital and co-chair of regulatory affairs at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association, said India’s deep tech framework avoids a “graduation cliff” that has historically cut companies off from support just as they scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These policy changes come as the RDI fund is beginning to take shape operationally, Pai said, with the first batch of fund managers identified and the process of selecting venture and private equity managers under way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While private capital for deep tech already exists in India — particularly in areas such as biotech — Pai told TechCrunch the RDI Fund is intended to act as a nucleus around which greater capital formation can occur. Unlike a traditional fund-of-funds, he noted, the vehicle is also designed to take direct positions and provide credit and grants to deep tech startups.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-s-deep-tech-funding-grows\">India’s deep tech funding grows</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of scale, India remains an emerging rather than dominant deep tech market. Indian deep tech startups have raised $8.54 billion in total to date, but recent data point to renewed momentum. Indian deep tech startups raised $1.65 billion in 2025, a sharp rebound from $1.1 billion in each of the previous two years after funding peaked at $2 billion in 2022, per Tracxn. The recovery suggests growing investor confidence, particularly in areas aligned with national priorities such as advanced manufacturing, defence, climate technologies, and semiconductors.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Overall, the pickup in funding suggests a gradual move toward longer-horizon investing,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, U.S. deep tech startups raised about $147 billion in 2025, more than 80 times the amount deployed in India that year, while China accounted for roughly $81 billion, data from Tracxn shows. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The disparity highlights the challenge India faces in building capital-intensive technologies, even with its wealth of engineering talent. So the hope is that these moves by the Indian government will lead to more investor participation over the medium term.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090651\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=768,540 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1200,843 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1280,899 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=430,302 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=720,506 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=900,632 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=800,562 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=1536,1079 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=668,469 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=534,375 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=878,617 878w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=708,497 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-deep-tech-startup-funding.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-longer-term-signal\">A longer-term signal</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For global investors, New Delhi’s framework change is being read as a signal of longer-term policy intent rather than a trigger for immediate shifts in allocation. “Deep tech companies operate on seven- to twelve-year horizons, so regulatory recognition that stretches the lifecycle gives investors greater confidence that the policy environment will not change mid-journey,” said Pratik Agarwal, a partner at Accel. While he said the change would not alter allocation models overnight or eliminate policy risk entirely, it increased investor comfort that India is thinking about deep tech on longer time horizons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The change shows that India is learning from the U.S. and Europe on how to create patient frameworks for frontier building,” Agarwal told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether the move will reduce the tendency of Indian startups to shift their headquarters overseas as they scale remains an open question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The extended runway strengthens the case for building and staying in India, Agarwal said, though access to capital and customers still matters. Over the past five years, he added, India’s public markets have shown a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/india-already-an-ipo-bright-spot-prepares-for-bigger-surge-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">growing appetite for venture-backed tech companies</a>, making domestic listings a more credible option than in the past. That, in turn, could ease some of the pressure on deep tech founders to incorporate overseas, even if access to procurement and late-stage capital will continue to shape where companies ultimately scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For investors backing long-horizon technologies, the ultimate test will be whether India can deliver globally competitive outcomes. The real signal, Kumar of Celesta Capital said, would be the emergence of a critical mass of Indian deep tech companies succeeding on the world stage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It would be great to see ten globally competitive deep tech companies from India achieve sustained success over the next decade,” he said, describing that as the benchmark he would look for in assessing whether India’s deep tech ecosystem is maturing.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan is expected to be there. Apple’s Tim Cook, too. (He has become a Super Bowl fixture since Apple Music began sponsoring the halftime show several years ago.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Longtime VC Venky Ganesan from Menlo Ventures gave the New York Times a quote about the whole thing, saying the Super Bowl in the Bay Area is “tech billionaires who got picked last in gym class paying $50,000 to pretend they’re friends with the guys who got picked first.” Added Ganesan, “And for the record, I, too, was picked last in gym class.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ganesan could likely afford a $50,000 ticket if he needed one. Menlo went all-in on Anthropic, setting up a $100 million fund with the AI company in summer 2024 to invest in other AI startups. The firm has also joined numerous funding rounds for Anthropic itself, both through its flagship fund and various special purpose vehicles. (Anthropic is reportedly expected to close a <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-more-20-billion-funding-010451731.html\">$20 billion round</a> of funding next week at a post-money valuation of $350 billion.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tickets are expensive across the board, averaging almost $7,000 according to the Times (with some last-minute seats still available on StubHub for closer to $3,600, according to a quick glance at the ticket reseller site). Only a quarter go to the general public; the rest are distributed to NFL teams. Of all ticket buyers, the largest group (27%) is coming from Washington State for the Seahawks, who’ve won just one Super Bowl in franchise history compared with the Patriots’ six titles, all with Tom Brady as quarterback.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1yGy9fELtE\">Google</a>, OpenAI, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQRu7DdTTVA\">Anthropic</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCyiXmxHqSg\">Amazon</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NerlyGrv7WM\">Meta</a> are splashing out for competing ads about whose AI is best for customers, so maybe their respective CEOs will show up, too.

The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras’ latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup’s $27 million Series A in 2016. <span>Since Benchmark delibe</span>rately keeps its funds under $450 million, the firm raised two separate vehicles, both called ‘Benchmark Infrastructure,’ according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benchmark declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company’s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/\">than $10 billion</a> to provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.) </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia’s chips. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42’s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras’ initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras’ investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-ai-chip-firm-cerebras-181107401.html\">according to Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This week, amid <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/01/27/opinion/tech-elite-will-flee-california-over-wealth-seizure-ballot-measure/\">ongoing rancor</a> from tech elites over the much maligned bill, it became apparent that someone was planning a so-called “March for Billionaires” in San Francisco. A <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://marchforbillionaires.org/\">website </a>advertising the event popped up online, providing little in the way of context other than a pithy tagline: “Vilifying billionaires is popular. Losing them is expensive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. “this is a joke/satire right??” one social media user <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ArthurCaplan/status/2018066423101161706?s=20\">wrote</a> not long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitely<em>not</em> a joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco Examiner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/technology/sf-billionaires-march-founder-revealed-derik-kauffman/article_1842be47-58a5-430c-b322-dff8910aa98f.html\">first reported</a> that the event’s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kauffman, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Kauffman told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies—just him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a conversation with TechCrunch, Kauffman — who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL — confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California’s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be “quite damaging to the tech economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy in question, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/25-0024A1%20%28Billionaire%20Tax%20%29.pdf\">Billionaire Tax Act</a>, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2026-01-19/explaining-californias-billionaire-tax-proposals-backlash-exodus\">backed by the state’s healthcare union SEIU</a> (Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, according <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abc7news.com/post/here-is-potential-impact-proposed-california-billionaire-tax-could-have-silicon-valley/18405002/\">to some experts</a>. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry’s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California or <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/01/19/california-wealth-tax-exodus/\">have already left</a>. It has also led to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/peter-thiel-california-wealth-tax.html\">monsoon of lobbying</a> in the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why he opposed the legislation, Kauffman expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. “This tax in particular is fatally flawed,” he said. “It hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,” Kauffman continued. “Additionally, there’s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Online conversation about Kauffman’s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. “I can’t imagine billionaires marching in the street,” one <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/DianaVGalbraith/status/2018360039069847836?s=20\">social media user said</a>, of the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That person would probably be right. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kauffman told TC that, so far, he isn’t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kauffman said that the event is likely to include “a few dozen attendees,” although he stressed that he really isn’t clear on how many people would show up.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it’s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That’s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/us/newsom-billionaire-tax-california.html\">veto it</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Tender starts as a payment processing platform for adult content. The show references the very real (and still controversial) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer\">Online Safety Bill </a>that the UK introduced, which has led to age verification and other enhanced rules for consuming adult content online.

Whitney is the embodiment of every tech baron cliche. Move fast, break things. Win at all costs. He’s lobbying politicians for a banking license and hunting for merger opportunities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harper, meanwhile, is leading her newly launched firm after feeling undermined at her previous firm and being called a DEI plant by the man who hired her (a nod to the decline of DEI in the past few years). She has teamed up with new friends and old frenemies and is looking for blood — meaning a company on the precipice of crashing. To her, Tender is that company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This puts her at odds with her friend Yasmin, who is married to Henry and is crafting communication and lobbying strategies for Tender. It’s pride and prejudice — the sugar and spice that help make the world go round. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090188\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/marisa-abela_2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>HBO</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The show nails the tech world with such accuracy that reality itself starts to feel like satire. Even TechCrunch gets name-checked as part of Tender’s media playbook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is commentary on fascism via the character Moritz, who lobbies against Western liberalism and is hesitant to sell his family’s bank to Whitney, whose last name is the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/industry-recap-season-4-episode-3-habseligkeiten-hbo.html\">Jewish-sounding Halberstram</a>. The character is perhaps a nod <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jan/29/silicon-valley-rightwing-technofascism\">to the rising “technofacism” criticism</a> of some tech barons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harper, meanwhile, is still a calculating sociopath. “My real passion lies with finding dead men walking,” she says at an investor breakfast. She ends up raising millions for her new firm. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She is the one character whose existence strains credibility. Personality-wise, she has to be shrewdly calculating; unlike Yasmin and Henry, she has nothing to fall back on should she fail. But would the UK establishment, which is notoriously insular, exclusionary, and white, really let a Black American woman rise through their ranks and beat them at their own game?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Who needs realism when she’s such a great character,” one Black British founder told me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said the show aptly captures how detached the UK upper class is from consequence and is actually one of the few shows he’s seen that “accurately portrays the ruthlessness of the British elite, specifically how they maneuver the media and governments to suit their own whims.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nepotism and lack of boundaries at work, people sleeping together for trade secrets, is very realistic and common, unfortunately,” one European investor added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Yasmin is headed down a dark path. Earlier this season, she organized a ménage à trois between her husband, Henry, and Whitney’s assistant, Hayley. As the season continues, her behavior becomes so hedonistic that one reviewer has already likened her to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/industry-recap-season-4-episode-3-habseligkeiten-hbo.html\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> — perhaps a perfect emblem of what lies at the pits of money and power, and the role some women play in digging those holes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090189\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>HBO</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Icarus moment could be on the way, however, at least for Whitney. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By now, the audience is familiar with how founders in the real world sometimes use deception to overinflate success (like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/frank-founder-charlie-javice-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-for-defrauding-jpmorgan-chase/\">Charlie Javice’s Frank</a>) and allegedly steal from investors and the public (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/27/ftx-crypto-exchange-collapse-lookback/\">the FTX crypto crash</a>). There are many such infamous cases, and some are even referenced in the show. But perhaps the most relevant real-world parallel for Tender would be the ultimate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/house-of-wirecard-insolvency/\">implosion</a> of the German fintech Wirecard a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wirecard <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wirecards-missing-2-billion-probably-doesnt-exist-board-says-11592802732?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdFGo0Eu63-uBF0k-Zag3EpnzqH6CUrA4LKVvlq30kE-XjJMJYSZdptk8EhN7c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6984a6fe&amp;gaa_sig=SrQ0eC7J8UdGNNL7DLCf19mXhMLqp8bjFKQ402BEphDywM9sYC8QGa_37ITWv7-Loz6Vxjti7c69jcdjjl4Emg%3D%3D\">admitted that the billions in cash</a> it reported having likely never existed, despite the company’s earlier claims that two banks in the Philippines were holding the funds. It was a tale of complex accounting and legal gray zones — much like the financial fraud depicted in Tender. Short sellers <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/04/covert-cameras-alleged-hacking-how-bust-payments-company-wirecard-hired-spies-lawyers-silence-critics#:~:text=Earl's%20claims%20include:%20*%20Kroll%20employees%20parked,Kroll%20employee%20doorstepped%20Earl%20at%20his%20home\">went after Wirecard</a>, too, and one blog dubbed them “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rutherfordsearch.com/en-US/blog/2021/06/when-short-sellers-become-whistleblowers-the-case-of-wirecard\">alternative whistleblowers</a>” — people who step in when “the market, and the regulator, refuse to see what is right in front of them.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The philosophy is one that one could easily see Harper embracing soon enough, especially after Eric tells her at one point that “short-only work is ugly, hard, investigative,” and that it’s “anti-status quo, anti-establishment, anti-power.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Wirecard, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/two-more-wirecard-executives-charged-over-accounting-scandal-2024-08-06/\">numerous people,</a> including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/tech/wirecard-ceo-markus-braun-arrested\">the CEO, were arrested</a>, while the COO <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/jan-marsalek-wirecard-moscow/\">went on the run</a> (and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wirecard-fugitive-jan-marsalek-financial-fraudster-russian-spymaster-2025-03-07/\">was also accused of being a Russian spy</a>). Tender’s fate remains unrealized until the last few episodes run. One of the best parts about “Industry” is that it moves fast and breaks things. It is so clearly set in our time and so audacious in its demeanor that the audience is forced to pick their favorite anti-hero and go along for the ride.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a rush, a thrill; the visual embodiment of the absence of ethical capitalists. And yet, just like in real life, we can’t get enough. <br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
