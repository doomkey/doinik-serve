            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meeting notetaker Read AI on Thursday launched an AI-powered email-based assistant called Ada, saying it helps users manage their schedules, answer questions based on a company’s knowledge base, and reply to out-of-office emails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is calling Ada a “digital twin” that handles tasks for you around the clock. Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ada can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada , can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Meet Ada: Your Digital Twin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIeqR_VpeH8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Read AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (Model Context Protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097385\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Read AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that while Ada, currently works via email, it will soon be available on Slack and Teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar earlier this month, Shim told TechCrunch that the company now has over 5 million monthly active users and plans to grow that number to 10 million. He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, which has raised over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/read-ai-raises-50m-to-integrate-its-bot-with-slack-email-and-more/\">$81 million in funding</a>, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.read.ai/post/read-ai-launches-search-copilot-an-industry-first-ai-tool-for-cross-platform-search-and-discovery--at-no-cost\">Search Copilot</a> for knowledge discovery for users, and last month, it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send a custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.read.ai/post/search-copilot-actions-building-workflows-that-work-for-you\">on internal and web knowledge</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/ai-note-taking-app-granola-adds-a-repeatable-prompts-feature/\">“recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts</a> to surface knowledge from meeting data. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quillmeetings.com\">Quill</a>, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bumble <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ir.bumble.com/news/news-details/2026/Bumble-Announces-Two-New-Features-For-Confidence-and-Clarity-in-Dating-2026-36eaJ_omGR/default.aspx\">announced</a> on Thursday that it’s adding a series of AI-driven features intended to help turn matches into lasting connections, including those that offer feedback and guidance on users’ bios, photos, and prompts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dating app’s new AI-suggested profile guidance tool will roll out globally and give “personalized, actionable feedback” on users’ bios and prompts. For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend ten years ago, but it’s still new information to many users. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/tinder-looks-to-ai-to-help-fight-swipe-fatigue-and-dating-app-burnout/\">Chemistry</a>, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/facebook-is-asking-to-use-meta-ai-on-photos-in-your-camera-roll-you-havent-yet-shared/\">asks to use its AI on your camera roll</a> that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/well/dating-irl-analog-online.html\">real-world experiences</a> that are not intermediated by an app.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The retailer was accused of misleading drivers about their potential base pay and tip amounts, and then deceived customers by saying that 100% of tips went to the drivers, when they did not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its original <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/WalmartSparkDriverComplaint.pdf\">complaint</a>, the FTC was joined by Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that Walmart, since 2021, had made false representations about Spark driver earnings. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among these, Walmart was accused of frequently splitting a customer’s order between drivers, which would lead to splitting the tip. Meanwhile, customers were told their driver — as in one single driver — would get the full tip. In batch orders, Walmart would remove tips from some of the orders without informing the driver. Walmart also promised tips to drivers in advance of taking orders, but then failed to collect a tip from the customer, leaving the driver without a tip entirely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other issues had to do with reductions Walmart made to drivers’ base pay after they had accepted an offer or other misrepresented incentives that could have provided drivers with extra cash. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Walmart also told customers that drivers would get 100% of their tips, but that wasn’t always true. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit alleged that these practices caused drivers to lose millions of dollars they were promised and generated thousands of consumer complaints. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of the settlement, Walmart will have to implement an earnings verification program to ensure drivers are paid the promised earnings and tips. It’s also prohibited from adjusting the base pay, incentives, or tips after the initial offer, except if the driver fails to provide the service or a customer cancels. Walmart has been banned from misrepresenting earnings in future driver offers, as well.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Labor markets cannot function efficiently without truthful and non-misleading information about earnings and other material terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement about the settlement agreement. “Today’s settlement reflects the Trump-Vance FTC’s focus on ensuring a healthy labor market for American workers, which is critical to the nation’s success.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/\">$100 million previously announced</a> crossover financing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses. Though they say they may seek additional capital before closing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/\">public via a SPAC merger</a> valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/techcrunch-mobility-self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-goes-public-and-a-shake-up-at-hyundais-supernal/\">SPAC road</a> to the public market in 2025.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As such, he has “some experience with university endowments,” which are some of the largest investors in venture capital funds, he told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov says as he scoured the world for open source projects, one complaint kept popping up: “There is no source of sustainable funding for open source maintainers. And that’s a really big problem.” (“Maintainer” refers to the developers who work on open source projects, such as debugging, choosing and verifying features submitted by the community, or programming new features themselves.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The endowment will support projects based on criteria such as its number of users, or how many other projects rely on that specific software to operate. It will also choose projects that are not already well-supported by grants, donations, or umbrella organizations such as Linux’s Alpha-Omega. Vinogradov has already assembled a board for the nonprofit.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cash-strapped-burned-out\">Cash strapped, burned out</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lack of money in open source is hardly new. Open source software is typically given away, and since the community often contributes time and efforts freely, up to 86% of open source developers <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/news/open-source-developers-are-exhausted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">are not paid for their work.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t much of a problem for hobbyists or for professional developers paid by their companies to maintain projects, but such a system stands on shaky ground. Open source software is the bedrock upon which the internet stands, and virtually every large company uses open source tools in some way. In fact, open source software accounts for <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/world-of-open-source-global-2025?hsLang=en&amp;_gl=1*3pooru*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjUzMTQ0MDA1LjE3NzE5NjEyMDM.*_ga_BKD8K5CRV0*czE3NzE5NjEyMDIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NzE5NjEyMDIkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_FBYHX832ZD*czE3NzE5NjEyMDIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NzE5NjEyMDIkajYwJGwwJGgw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">up to 55% of the tech stack in organizations</a>, and is present in everything from databases to operating systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it is certainly possible for open source developers to commercialize their free projects <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/databricks-perplexity-co-founder-pledges-100m-on-new-fund-for-ai-researchers/\">to gain wealth beyond their wildest dreams</a>, the odds, to misquote the Hunger Games, are not in their favor.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is, and has been for decades, a core of developers who volunteer their time and efforts for free to manage popular, important, and critical projects. And many of them are <a href=\"https://opensourcepledge.com/blog/burnout-in-open-source-a-structural-problem-we-can-fix-together/?ref=itsfoss.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">burned out.</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This issue came into the public’s consciousness briefly in 2014, with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/massive-security-bug-in-openssl-could-effect-a-huge-chunk-of-the-internet/\">OpenSSL Heartbleed disaster,</a> where a bug was found in an open source security project, used by most of the internet, that was maintained by a single developer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been many attempts to fix the funding situation over the years. Some projects take donations from corporate sponsors. For instance, The Linux Foundation, which brought in about <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Foundation-2025-Report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$300 million last year</a> largely from corporate sponsors, doles out grants to select projects through its Alpha-Omega Project. In 2025, Alpha-Omega issued $5.8 million to 14 projects, it said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some projects take donations directly from corporate donors. In January, for instance, Anthropic donated <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/anthropic-has-made-a-large-contribution-to-the-python-software-foundation-and-open-source-security/105694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$1.5 million to the Python Software Foundation</a>. While the Foundation said it was thrilled to have that cash, Anthropic <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/with-ai-investor-loyalty-is-almost-dead-at-least-a-dozen-openai-vcs-now-also-back-anthropic/\">itself raised $30 billion this month</a>. Such a donation is couch-change to the AI lab. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, not every developer wants to take corporate donations, as there are worries of granting too much influence to donor companies. For instance, there was a big hubbub last year in the Ruby community surrounding some long-time maintainers leaving and its big sponsor Spotify, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/open_source_to_closed_doors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Register reported.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Open Source Endowment hopes to support projects while displacing such risks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only way to support open source sustainably is private funds,” says Vinogradov. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why hasn’t an endowment been tried before? Endowments require patience, Vinogradov says. They invest many of their assets, spending only a fraction of their income in any given year, and require years or even decades to grow to a meaningful size.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if done right, that patience will result in an independent fund that could support critical open source projects forever.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/xs-ad-business-improved-under-departing-ceo-linda-yaccarino-but-its-still-tough-times-ahead/\">ad sales improved</a> under former CEO Linda Yaccarino, its 2025 revenues <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">were still lower</a> than they were prior to Musk’s acquisition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eMarketer’s</a> forecast last May, X’s ad business was expected to start revitalizing sometime last year, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-12/musk-s-x-posts-higher-sales-amid-costly-turnaround\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> confirmed, but would remain half the size it was before the sale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X says the new aspect ratios now being supported include 4:5 (1440 x 1800 pixels) and 2:3 (1080 × 1620 pixels). The company already supports other formats, including 1:1 (1080 × 1080 pixels), 16:9 (1920 × 1080 pixels), 9:16 (1080 × 1920 pixels), and 1.91:1 (2064 × 1080 pixels).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re committed to empowering advertisers to hit their performance goals with greater ease and impact,” said Monique Pintarelli, head of global advertising at xAI, in a statement. (xAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/\">acquired</a> X last year.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With full aspect ratio support, brands can now repurpose creatives directly on X—eliminating reformatting, duplication, or compromise—while unlocking faster testing, brand consistency, and incremental reach among our highly engaged, real-time audience for superior results,” she added.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Developers invest countless hours, months, or even years creating games just to surrender a significant portion — up to 30% — of their earnings to major players like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/y-combinator-says-apples-app-store-has-hindered-startup-growth/\">Apple</a> and Google. However, a newcomer has entered the scene, aiming to revolutionize this model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meet <a href=\"https://about.jest.com/.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jest</a>, a marketplace for messaging games that recently emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding. Jest believes that the future of mobile gaming distribution won’t come from an app store, but rather from within the messaging app. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments. <br><br>With RCS adoption growing, the landscape is shifting. In 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/apple-finally-adds-support-for-rcs-in-latest-ios-18-beta/\">Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18</a>, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-announces-1b-rcs-messages-sent-in-the-u-s-daily/\">according to Google</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097049\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=430,229 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=720,383 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=900,479 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=800,425 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=668,355 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=1161,617 1161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=708,376 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jest</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This convenience is particularly impactful as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/app-downloads-declined-again-in-2025-but-consumer-spending-soared-to-nearly-156b/\">consumers are downloading fewer games</a>. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform had already achieved two significant milestones: more than 1 million messaging games played and over 300,000 messages exchanged. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing 3-4 times better retention than traditional mobile apps. That’s a fundamental shift in the engagement curve. On the user acquisition front, we’ve completely validated that people will sign up and play games through messaging, with our early partners reporting 30-60% lower acquisition costs compared to mobile apps. It’s remarkably simple. Just tap on a link, and you’re in,” Vitanov shared with us. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097048\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=680,546 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=430,345 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=720,578 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=900,723 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=800,643 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=668,537 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=467,375 467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=661,531 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jest</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, what’s most appealing about Jest’s marketplace is the revenue model for developers: an impressive 90/10 split, with 90% of earnings going directly to them. This stands in contrast to the typical 30% commission taken by traditional app stores, offering a promising new avenue for gaming studios.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s also a clever network effect built in. If one studio acquires a user but another studio monetizes them, we split the economics: 70% to the monetizing studio, 20% to the acquiring studio, and 10% to Jest. This creates powerful incentives where even viral games that don’t monetize well can generate revenue streams for their developers when those users play other games on the platform,” Vitanov added. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Jest has already attracted interest from several development partners, including teams behind popular titles such as “Episode,” “Puppy Mansion,” and “Kingdom Maker.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed funding, led by Innovation Endeavors, will go toward scaling the platform and onboarding the first group of gaming studios. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To further accelerate growth, Jest has also launched a dedicated Games Fund to support studios at every stage of franchise development on the platform.  This fund will deploy capital across three tiers: $1 million for flagship titles, $200,000 for promising mid-stage titles, and $40,000 for exploratory projects and experimental concepts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Jest is live in the U.S. and is set to expand to 14 additional countries by the third quarter of 2026.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move comes a week after the design company <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/figma-anthropic-ai-code-designs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">struck</a> a similar partnership with Anthropic to integrate Claude Code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This integration lets users start working with a design in Figma or code in Codex, and move between the two platforms easily using Figma’s MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, users could bring details from Figma design files, Figma Make, or FigJam into Codex for code-based implementation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With this integration, teams can build on their best ideas — not just their first idea — by combining the best of code with the creativity, collaboration, and craft that comes with Figma’s infinite canvas,” Loredana Crisan, Figma’s chief design officer, said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The integration makes Codex powerful for a much broader range of builders and businesses because it doesn’t assume you’re ‘a designer’ or ‘an engineer’ first. Engineers can iterate visually without leaving their flow, and designers can work closer to real implementation without becoming full-time coders,” Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI first launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/\">Codex as a command-line coding assistant</a> last year to compete with Anthropic’s much lauded Claude Code.

The company maps complex corporate environments and processes so that agents have the context they need to scale quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI and Anthropic are building these brilliant interns that can be leveraged within the company,” says Trace CEO Tim Cherkasov, referring to the AI labs’ tools. “We’re building the manager that knows where to put them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, the London-based company said it had raised $3 million in seed funding from Y Combinator, Zeno Ventures, Transpose Platform Management, Goodwater Capital, Formosa Capital, and WeFunder. Angel investors Benjamin Bryant and Kevin Moore also invested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trace’s system starts by building a knowledge graph from a company’s existing tools — systems like email, Slack, and Airtable that shape the day-to-day working life of the firm. With that context in place, users can prompt the system with a high-level task — like “We need to design a new microsite” or “Lets develop our 2027 sales plan” — and Trace will come back with a step-by-step workflow, delegating some tasks to AI agents and assigning others to human workers. When the system does invoke an AI agent, it will prompt it with the specific data needed to complete its sub-task. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea is to automate away the delicate work of on-boarding AI agents, one of the biggest blockers for actual deployment within companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With so many companies focused on agentic AI, Trace will have plenty of competition. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-launches-new-push-for-enterprise-agents-with-plugins-for-finance-engineering-and-design/\">Earlier this week</a>, Anthropic launched its own take on enterprise agents, focused on pre-built plugins for specific departmental functions. And many of the workplace productivity services Trace will be drawing from, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/jiras-latest-update-allows-ai-agents-and-humans-to-work-side-by-side/\">Atlassian’s Jira</a>, are launching their own agents, which will potentially compete with the startup’s system. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Trace’s founders believe their knowledge-graph approach will be the key to success, as they can build context engineering deep into the structure of agentic deployment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“2024 and 2025 was still about prompt engineering. Now we’ve moved from prompt engineering to context engineering,” says CTO Artur Romanov. “Whoever provides the best context at the right time is going to be the infrastructure on top of which the AI-first companies will be built. And we hope to be that infrastructure.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It looked great on paper but didn’t really work in real life,” Lucena said.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She had learned firsthand that hiring is typically based on markers of success like college degrees, previous work experience, and a gut instinct. But she knew there had to be a better way. So she developed Mappa and spent years creating a proprietary dataset based on hundreds of interviews that allowed her team to analyze behavior based on biomarkers indicated through people’s speech patterns. Through this process, the Mappa team found that to make the right hire the first time, a candidate can’t just be great on paper; they also have to be compatible.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s no trait that’s good or bad inherently; it’s more of what environment do you put that person in, and what roles are better aligned with people’s sort of tendencies and styles. So that’s how we’ve been thinking about defining compatibility,” Lucena said in the podcast interview. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mappa is powered by an all Latinx team that knows how frustrating it is to be overlooked based on superficial biases or a lack of the “correct” experiences. She describes them as underdogs that understand this problem on a personal level.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are all underdogs. We are all folks that have been overlooked in some degree. And I guess that makes it even more important that we are the ones building this,” Lucena said. “Having people like us building this technology, at the level we are doing, with the quality we are able to get to the market and serving our clients the way we do. It also opens up a door for others to come and join and know that there are multiple ways still to build technology.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucena’s best advice for early-stage founders who are hiring is to take your time and be sure the compatibility is there from the beginning to avoid the hassle of hiring, firing, and rehiring for the same role.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Isabelle Johannessen is our host. <a href=\"https://pod.link/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vWUZMNjEyNzkzNjQ5NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Build Mode</a> is produced and edited by Maggie Nye.

The alerts are launching in the coming weeks to parents who are enrolled in parental supervision on Instagram. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Meta-owned social platform says that while it already blocks users from searching for suicide and self-harm content, these new alerts are designed to make sure parents are aware if their teen is repeatedly trying to search for this content so that they can support them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Searches that may trigger an alert include phrases encouraging suicide or self-harm, phrases indicating a teen might be at risk of harming themselves, and terms such as “suicide” or “self-harm.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instagram says parents will receive the alert via email, text, or WhatsApp, depending on the contact information they’ve provided, along with an in-app notification.

The study also found that children who faced stressful life events were more likely to struggle with regulating their social media use appropriately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the ongoing lawsuits accusing the company of failing to protect teens on its platforms, the timing of these new alerts isn’t exactly surprising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that it will aim to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, as overuse could reduce their overall effectiveness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In working to strike this important balance, we analyzed Instagram search behavior and consulted with experts from our Suicide and Self-Harm Advisory Group,” Instagram explained in its blog post. “We chose a threshold that requires a few searches within a short period of time, while still erring on the side of caution. While that means we may sometimes notify parents when there may not be a real cause for concern, we feel — and experts agree — that this is the right starting point, and we’ll continue to monitor and listen to feedback to make sure we’re in the right place.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The alerts are rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada next week, and will become available in other regions later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the future, Instagram plans to launch these notifications when a teen tries to engage the app’s AI in conversations about suicide or self-harm. </p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the </em><a href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</em></a><em>.

For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/salesforce-acquires-informatica-for-8-billion/\">data management company </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/salesforce-acquires-informatica-for-8-billion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Informatica</a> last May.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Net income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, with <a href=\"https://x.com/anshublog/status/2018762793978413111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Salesforce as their poster child</a>, have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seat <a href=\"https://x.com/mcuban/status/2026690613014298881\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">business models obsolete</a>. The situation has been dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also revamped the earnings call itself. It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&amp;A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja; the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts; and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: They all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: agentic work units (“AWU”). The idea here is that instead of simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but really <a href=\"https://www.saastr.com/the-real-data-on-ai-agents-what-1-trillion-tokens-a-day-reveals-with-openrouters-coo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is not</a> in the AI world.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce president and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable piece of work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itself <a href=\"https://x.com/Benioff/status/2026803953342755116/photo/3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">owning most of the tech stack</a>, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\">OpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier</a>. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data) <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2019413714341097945\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on the bottom as the unseen engines</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round values Gushwork at $33 million post-money, up from about $7.5 million following its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/gushwork-ai-funding-lightspeed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lightspeed-led $2.1 million pre-seed</a> in July 2023, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The latest financing brings Gushwork’s total funding to $11 million, the startup said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding comes as AI companies, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-its-google-challenger-chatgpt-search/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/perplexity-received-780-million-queries-last-month-ceo-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Perplexity</a>, begin to chip away at traditional web search, prompting incumbents like Google to roll out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-generated overviews</a> and other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/google-now-lets-users-jump-from-ai-overviews-into-ai-mode-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conversational features</a> across their search products. Gushwork is betting this shift will create a new opportunity to help businesses surface in AI-driven discovery channels using its automated marketing agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2023 by Nayrhit Bhattacharya (pictured above, right) and Adithya Venkatesh (pictured above, left), Gushwork initially focused on helping small and medium businesses outsource workflows using a mix of AI and human expertise. The startup began narrowing its focus toward search-led marketing after seeing strong customer demand for help with improving online visibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started, we were focused on helping businesses outsource faster and outsource better,” Bhattacharya told TechCrunch in an interview, adding that the pull around search from customers became increasingly hard to ignore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s platform uses a network of AI agents to automatically generate and update search-optimized content; build backlinks — typically 10 to 20 per customer — through a network of roughly 200 to 300 partner websites; and track inbound leads through an integrated content management system. The goal, Bhattacharya said, is to help businesses surface in both traditional search results and AI-generated answers without relying on large in-house marketing teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says it has signed up more than 300 paying customers — roughly 95% of them in the U.S. — with subscriptions starting at $800 per month. Gushwork is currently running at about $1.5 million in annualized recurring revenue after rolling out its AI search-focused product around three months ago and is targeting $3 million to $3.5 million ARR in the next three months, Bhattacharya said, adding that the startup is growing about 50% to 80% month over month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across Gushwork’s customer base, about 20% of website traffic now comes from AI-driven search and chat platforms, but those sources account for around 40% of inbound leads, Bhattacharya said, citing the startup’s internal data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The higher-intent leads, Bhattacharya said, are already translating into business outcomes for some customers. In one case, a professional services client has closed between $200,000 and $350,000 worth of contracts after adopting the platform, he said, declining to disclose the customer’s name. He added that many users are seeing meaningful pipeline growth as AI-driven discovery gains traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s customer base today is concentrated among high-ticket B2B service providers, industrial distributors, and contract manufacturers, primarily in the U.S., Bhattacharya said. The startup’s average subscription runs about $800 to $900 per month, or roughly $9,000 to $10,000 in annual contract value, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift toward AI-driven discovery is still in its early stages but is gaining momentum. Tools such as generative AI chatbots and AI web browsers are increasingly being used by buyers to research vendors and products. OpenAI said in July 2025 that ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/chatgpt-users-send-2-5-billion-prompts-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">received about 2.5 billion prompts a day</a> globally, including roughly 330 million from U.S. users. Bhattacharya said the trend is beginning to reshape how some businesses approach online visibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork plans to use the new funding to expand its engineering team, improve model accuracy, and scale its go-to-market efforts, Bhattacharya said. He added that the startup has more than 800 businesses on its waitlist that it plans to begin onboarding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, headquartered in Delaware with an office in Bengaluru, has about 70 employees in India, along with several contractors.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
