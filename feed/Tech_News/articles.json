It gave him an interest for both sides of healthcare: the medicine and business sides, he told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So he went to the annual conference hosted by famed physician-scientist Dr. Daniel Kraft to learn about new tech that could improve results while lowering costs. Dr. Peter Diamandis, founder and chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, was on stage that year with Dr. Bob Hariri, a stem-cell pioneer and co-founder of several health techs like genomics company, Human Longevity, Kapp said. They discussed genomics, microbiomics, and new tech that wasn’t part of mainstream medicine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inspired, Kapp went back to his home town of Naples, Florida, and “started a thing called Longevity Performance Center. The idea was to do early detection and then optimization of people’s health,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2020, Diamandis (pictured above) and his buddy Tony Robbins heard of Kapp’s center and visited. They had a stem cell startup called Fountain Therapeutics. Conversation soon turned toward a merger, and by October that year, the two companies became <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fountainlife.com/\">Fountain Life</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kapp remained CEO with both Diamandis and Robbins as his co-founders and board members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today his board also includes Hariri as an adviser; Todd Wanek, CEO of Ashley Furniture Industries, as an investor; and wealthy Indian business mogul B.K. Modi as an investor as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fountain Life tells TechCrunch exclusively that it just raised an $18 million series B, led by EOS Ventures, with participation from most of the existing members of the board. Fountain previously raised an $80 million Series A and has raised about $108 million total, Kapp said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Longevity as a subject of serious study by the medical community is a new field. When Kapp (pictured below) first launched his center, “We didn’t know exactly what longevity meant,” he said. But over the last four or five years, much more research has been done. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first principle of longevity, he said, is “don’t die of anything stupid.” Therefore, Fountain Life’s centers, of which there are four today, have a heavy focus on prevention screening, looking for illnesses and chronic conditions at their earliest stages when they tend to be asymptomatic. Blood tests and body scans gather data on over 100 biomarkers from liver fat to “microbiome concentrations,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second principal is optimization, meaning improving those markers with scientifically validated treatments, he said. And the third principal is “using the latest regenerative therapies under FDA trials,” to treat illness or achieve optimization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Screening tests may discover, for example, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which, left untreated, may lead to certain cancers, he said. The solution, if caught early, is to restore microbiome balance with specific, prescribed microbiotics.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Fountain Life co-founder CEO Dr. William Kapp\" class=\"wp-image-3036347\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg 938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Dr. William Kapp</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Fountain Life</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Fountain’s members, testing is repeated every quarter or so, and patients can track results and ask questions of an AI-powered app called Zori.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s pricey, Kapp admitted. A full subscription costs $30,000 a year, and $10,000 will cover just the testing process and AI, but not ongoing tests and medical support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Kapp remembers two stories that told him this work was on the right track. The wife of a Robbins fan bought a membership for her husband, and the tests caught early-stage, asymptomatic kidney cancer. The husband is now cancer-free. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When global hotelier Sam Nazarian was exploring a partnership with Fountain to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-hotelier-sam-nazarian--global-business-icon-tony-robbins-partner-to-announce-the-estate-a-revolutionary-luxury-hospitality--residential-ecosystem-anchored-in-the-world-of-preventative-medicine-ai-and-longevity-302252505.html\">put longevity centers in luxury hotels</a>, Nazarian did Fountain’s tests and found a brain aneurysm. They successfully treated it, Nazarian has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/therealdeal_salonseries-activity-7315381878507593729-0a2v/\">publicly said.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kapp says the new funding will allow the company to open more centers. In addition to Naples; Westchester, New York; Orlando; and Dallas, a center in Houston will open in December. Centers in Los Angeles and Miami are planned for Q2 of 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He hopes to solve the affordability issue by working on “clinic development” where Fountain trains medical facilities on its methodologies. Kapp says that as the tech and expertise become more widely available, this will drive down costs for access.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fountain is not the only doctor-driven longevity testing startup. Famed functional health doctor Mark Hyman has a company called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://Function%20Health\">Function Health</a>. It offers a package of about 160 blood tests, with follow-up tests every three to six months, for a $500/year membership (with additional fees for additional blood tests). Its platform similarly analyzes and tracks test results, although it doesn’t do full body scans or offer direct access to physicians.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But much like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/dating-safety-app-tea-breached-exposing-72000-user-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tea, the dating-gossip app for women</a> it was trying to replicate, TeaOnHer had gaping holes in its security that exposed its users’ personal information, including photos of their driver’s licenses and other government-issued identity documents, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/a-rival-tea-app-for-men-is-leaking-its-users-personal-data-and-drivers-licenses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch reported</a> last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These gated community-like apps were created ostensibly to let users share information about their relationships under the guise of personal safety. However, shoddy coding and security flaws highlight the ongoing privacy risks inherent in requiring users to submit sensitive information to use apps and websites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such risks are only going to worsen; popular apps and web services are already having to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/reddit-rolls-out-age-verification-in-the-uk-to-comply-with-new-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comply with age verification laws</a> that require people to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/youtube-rolls-out-age-estimatation-tech-to-identify-u-s-teens-and-apply-additional-protections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">submit their identity documents</a> before they can be granted access to adult-themed content, despite the privacy and security risks associated with storing databases of people’s personal information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch published our story last week, we did not publish specific details of the bugs we discovered in TeaOnHer, erring on the side of caution so as to not help bad actors exploit the bug. Instead, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/a-rival-tea-app-for-men-is-leaking-its-users-personal-data-and-drivers-licenses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">we decided to publish a limited disclosure</a>, because of the app’s rising popularity and the immediate risks that users faced when using the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of the time of disclosure, TeaOnHer was #2 in the free app charts on the Apple App Store, a position still held by the app today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flaws we found appear to be resolved. TechCrunch can now share how we were able to find users’ driver’s licenses within 10 minutes of being sent a link to the app in the App Store, thanks to easy to find flaws in the app’s public-facing backend system, or API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app’s developer, Xavier Lampkin, did not respond to multiple requests for comment after we submitted details of the security flaws, nor would Lampkin commit to notifying affected TeaOnHer users or state regulators of the security lapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We also asked Lampkin if any security reviews were carried out before the TeaOnHer app was launched, but we got no reply. (We have more on disclosure later on.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alright, start the clock.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-teaonher-exposed-admin-panel-credentials\">TeaOnHer exposed ‘admin panel’ credentials</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before we even downloaded the app, we first wanted to find out where TeaOnHer was hosted on the internet by looking at its public-facing infrastructure, such as its website and anything hosted on its domain.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is usually a good place to start as it helps understand what other services the domain is connected to on the internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To find the domain name, we first looked (by chance) at the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250812173917/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teaonher-dating-advice/id6749215648?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">app’s listing on the Apple App Store</a> to find the app’s website. This can usually be found in its privacy policy, which apps must include before Apple will list them. (The app listing also claims the developer “does not collect any data from this app,” which is demonstrably false, so take that as you will.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TeaOnHer’s privacy policy was in the form of a published Google Doc, which included an email address with a <code>teaonher.com</code> domain, but no website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The website wasn’t public at the time, so with no website loading, we looked at the domain’s public-facing DNS records, which can help to identify what else is hosted on the domain, such as the type of email servers or web hosting. We also wanted to look for any public subdomains that the developer might use to host functionality for the app (or host other resources that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/08/sorry-i-gatecrashed-your-zoom-meeting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">should probably not be public</a>), such as admin dashboards, databases, or other web-facing services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But when we looked at the TeaOnHer’s public internet records, it had no meaningful information other than a single subdomain, <code>appserver.teaonher.com</code>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When we opened this page in our browser, what loaded was the landing page for TeaOnHer’s API (for the curious, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26048764-teaonher-api-backend-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">we uploaded a copy here</a>). An API simply allows things on the internet to communicate with each other, such as linking an app to its central database.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was on this landing page that we found the exposed email address and plaintext password (which <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26048764-teaonher-api-backend-page/#document/p1/a2666767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wasn’t that far off “password”</a>) for Lampkin’s account to access the TeaOnHer “admin panel.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The API page showed that the admin panel, used for the document verification system and user management, was located at “localhost,” which simply refers to the physical computer running the server and may not have been directly accessible from the internet. It’s unclear if anyone could have used the credentials to access the admin panel, but this was in itself a sufficiently alarming finding.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this point, we were only about two minutes in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Otherwise, the API landing page didn’t do much other than offer some indication as to what the API can do. The page listed several API endpoints, which the app needs to access in order to function, such as retrieving user records from TeaOnHer’s database, for users to leave reviews, and sending notifications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With knowledge of these endpoints, it can be easier to interact with the API directly, as if we were imitating the app itself. Every API is different, so learning how an API works and how to communicate with one can take time to figure out, such as which endpoints to use and the parameters needed to effectively speak its language. Apps like Postman can be helpful for accessing and interacting directly with APIs, but this requires time and a certain degree of trial and error (and patience) to make APIs spit out data when they shouldn’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in this case, there was an even easier way. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-teaonher-api-allowed-unauthenticated-access-to-user-data\">TeaOnHer API allowed unauthenticated access to user data</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This API landing page included <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26048764-teaonher-api-backend-page/#document/p1/a2666752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an endpoint called <code>/docs</code></a>, which contained the API’s auto-generated documentation (powered by a product called Swagger UI) that contained the full list of commands that can be performed on the API. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This documentation page was effectively a master sheet of all the actions you can perform on the TeaOnHer API as a regular app user, and more importantly, as the app’s administrator, such as creating new users, verifying users’ identity documents, moderating comments, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The API documentation also featured the ability to query the TeaOnHer API and return user data, essentially letting us retrieve data from the app’s backend server and display it in our browser.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s not uncommon for developers to publish their API documentation, the problem here was that some API requests could be made without any authentication — no passwords or credentials were needed to return information from the TeaOnHer database. In other words, you could run commands on the API to access users’ private data that should not have been accessible to a user of the app, let alone anyone on the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this was conveniently and publicly documented for anyone to see.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Requesting a list of users currently in the TeaOnHer identity verification queue, for example — no more than pressing a button on the API page, nothing fancy here — would return dozens of account records on people who had recently signed up to TeaOnHer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The records returned from TeaOnHer’s server contained users’ unique identifiers within the app (essentially a string of random letters and numbers), their public profile screen name, and self-reported age and location, along with their private email address. The records also included web address links containing photos of the users’ driver’s licenses and corresponding selfies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Worse, these photos of driver’s licenses, government-issued IDs, and selfies were stored in an Amazon-hosted S3 cloud server set as publicly accessible to anyone with their web addresses.

With uninhibited access to the API, a malicious user could have scraped huge amounts of user data from the app, much like what happened with <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/women-dating-safety-app-tea-breached-users-ids-posted-to-4chan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Tea app to begin with</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From bean to cup, that was about 10 minutes, and we hadn’t even logged-in to the app yet. The bugs were so easy to find that it would be sheer luck if nobody malicious found them before we did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We asked, but Lampkin would not say if he has the technical ability, such as logs, to determine if anyone had used (or misused) the API at any time to gain access to users’ verification documents, such as by scraping web addresses from the API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the days since our report to Lampkin, the API landing page has been taken down, along with its documentation page, and it now displays only the state of the server that the TeaOnHer API is running on as “healthy.” At least on cursory tests, the API now appears to rely on authentication, and the previous calls made using the API no longer work. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The web addresses containing users’ uploaded identity documents have also been restricted from public view. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TeaOnHer developer dismissed efforts to disclose flaws</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that TeaOnHer had no official website at the time of our findings, TechCrunch contacted the email address listed on the privacy policy in an effort to disclose the security lapses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the email bounced back with an error saying the email address couldn’t be found. We also tried contacting Lampkin through the email address on his website, Newville Media, but our email bounced back with the same error message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch reached Lampkin via LinkedIn message, asking him to provide an email address where we could send details of the security flaws. Lampkin responded with a general “support” email address.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch discloses a security flaw, we reach out to confirm first that a person or company is the correct recipient. Otherwise, blindly sending details of a security bug to the wrong person could create a risk. Before sharing specific details of the flaws, we asked the recipient of the “support” email address if this was the correct address to disclose a security exposure involving TeaOnHer user data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You must have us confused with ‘the Tea app’,” Lampkin replied by email. (We hadn’t.) “We don’t have a security breach or data leak,” he said. (It did.) “We have some bots at most but we haven’t scaled big enough to be in that conversation yet, sorry you were misinformed.” (We weren’t.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Satisfied that we had established contact with the correct person (albeit not with the response we received), TechCrunch shared details of the security flaws, as well as several links to exposed driver’s licenses, and a copy of Lampkin’s own data to underscore the severity of the security issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Thank you for this information. This is very concerning. We are going to jump on this right now,” said Lampkin.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite several follow-up emails, we have not heard from Lampkin since we disclosed the security flaws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It doesn’t matter if you’re a one-person software shop or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/jack-dorsey-says-his-secure-new-bitchat-app-has-not-been-tested-for-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a billionaire vibe coding through a weekend</a>: Developers still have a responsibility to keep their users’ data safe.

Today, however, the company faces regulatory pressure and new laws around the world to rein in its power in the app distribution market.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After our decade-long relationship, I’m breaking up with Spotify. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s nothing personal. It’s just that Spotify and I have grown up, but we haven’t grown together.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, I’ve been tempted to leave Spotify many times. I know that the company faces accusations of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/\">poor streaming payouts</a> for artists, compared to its competitors, and I haven’t forgotten that it was Spotify that platformed Joe Rogan’s podcast, then exclusive to the platform, to spread <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/covid-misinformation-joe-rogan-spotify-petition-1282240/\">misinformation</a> about COVID-19 and other viruses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I know that Spotify is trying to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1534556884384063490\">kill the RSS feed</a>, a move that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techwontsave.us/episode/204_how_spotify_tried_to_take_over_podcasting_w_eric_silver\">siphons independence</a> from podcasters. And yet, I’m embarrassed to say that until recently, these issues didn’t move me enough to take the time and energy to investigate alternatives to Spotify, a platform that I’ve been using daily since high school.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unfortunately easy for us to bury our heads in the sand when the tech companies we pay monthly do things that disappoint us. (Yes, I still remember when Netflix<span> </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/netflix-layoffs-tudum-editorial/\">laid off my industry colleagues</a>, but I also know I’ll end up watching the new season of “Love is Blind”). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We don’t feel like our one subscription makes a difference — after all, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/the-backlash-against-duolingo-going-ai-first-didnt-even-matter/\">Duolingo</a> still beat revenue estimates after sparking backlash when it said it would replace contractors with AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Spotify finally got to me in a way that’s unavoidable: when I open the app, I cannot bear its all-encompassing, suffocating reliance on algorithmic recommendations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s an overwhelming display of visual clutter from the time it takes to navigate from Spotify’s home page to the music you’re looking for. These suggestions are front-and-center when you open the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, I may see an unsolicited, full-screen pop-up promoting a new podcast. Then, I’m greeted with a 2-by-4 grid of music and podcast suggestions, including new episodes of shows I listened to once because they had a guest I liked, plus some other albums that I’ve dabbled in briefly over the last month or so. Below that, there’s a sponsored recommendation for a song I might like by an artist that I have never heard of. When I navigate to the search tab, I’m prompted with an audiobook recommendation, and if I scroll a little bit, I see vertical video clips that look like they belong on TikTok.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s easy to fall into Spotify’s recommendations, as the app constantly pelts you with customized playlists that its AI has curated specifically for you. On Spotify, you never have to make any decisions — and for some listeners, maybe that’s the point. But I noticed that I stopped listening to the music I actually wanted to listen to, and instead, I embraced the music that Spotify told me I wanted to listen to. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Without realizing it, I gave up my agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t to say that my moral qualms with Spotify didn’t influence my choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a January <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/spotify-says-it-paid-10-billion-to-music-industry-last-year/\">report</a> from the music financing platform Duetti, Spotify, a company worth about $140 billion, pays about $3 per 1,000 streams. Amazon Music, Apple Music, and YouTube paid $8.80, $6.20, and $4.80, respectively, per 1,000 streams in 2024. (Spotify <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/spotify-says-it-paid-10-billion-to-music-industry-last-year/\">previously disputed the accuracy</a> of these figures)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify further alienated a portion of its audience in June, when CEO Daniel Ek announced that his investment firm led a nearly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/spotifys-daniel-ek-just-bet-bigger-on-helsing-europes-defense-tech-darling/\">$700 million funding round</a> for a company making AI-enabled military weapons. Some bands like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/deerhoof-to-remove-music-from-spotify/\">Deerhoof</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/xiu-xiu-to-pull-music-from-spotify/\">Xiu Xiu</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2025/08/11/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-spotify-protest-interview\">King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard</a> pulled their catalogs from Spotify in protest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s like deja vu. In 2022, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young pulled their music from Spotify over Joe Rogan’s platforming of medical misinformation. (The two artists returned to the platform in 2024.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps it’s taken me so long to leave Spotify because choosing a streaming platform leaves you between a rock and a hard place. But if you’re attached to your years of playlists, tools like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/14/these-two-friends-built-a-simple-tool-to-transfer-playlists-between-apple-music-and-spotify-and-it-works-great/\">Soundiiz</a> make it easy to port your collection between platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I chose Apple Music, mostly because I got a new iPhone and it came with a three-month free trial, which helped me ease my transition. Also, Apple Music has lossless audio, which Spotify has been <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/audio/spotify/spotify-hi-fi-release-date-rumors-price-predictions-and-more\">promising for nearly five years</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But I cannot tell you with a straight face that I have departed big, bad Spotify to support the little guy, when I’ve opted for another tech giant. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have my ethical concerns around Apple, too — even as I type this on my Magic Keyboard that’s connected to my MacBook Pro while my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch sit on the other side of my desk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently showed up at the White House to gift Donald Trump with a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/07/trump-tim-cook-gift-white-house-apple/\">custom, Apple-branded plaque,</a> which sits atop a 24-karat gold base, while performing his fiduciary duty to shareholders to keep Apple products tariff-free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At least the Apple Music app isn’t as overwhelming as Spotify. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

You can’t innovate in circuit design. It’s too mature.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Israel-based NeoLogic nevertheless set out to prove them wrong, and the fabless semiconductor startup has been building a server CPU that uses more simplified logic — how a chip processes information — with fewer transistors and logic gates to run faster while requiring less power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NeoLogic was founded in 2021 by Messica, CEO, and Leshem, CTO, who together have 50 years of experience in the semiconductor industry. Leshem spent decades working on chip design at companies like Intel and Synopsis, while Messica focused on circuit design and the manufacturing side.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We co-founded this company more than four years ago because Moore’s Law was dead,” Messica said, referring to the 1960s observation that the number of transistors on microchips doubles every two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around a decade ago, Messica said, companies stopped trying to scale transistors down in size, because transistors had gotten so small, there wasn’t much more progress to be made there. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, he says, NeoLogic wasn’t convinced. The startup is working with two hyperscaler partners on the design of the server CPUs, but Messica would not disclose their names. The company plans to have a single-core test chip by the end of the year, and hopes to get its server CPUs into data centers by 2027.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NeoLogic recently raised a $10 million Series A round led by KOMPAS VC with participation from M Ventures, Maniv Mobility and lool Ventures. The company will use the funds to expand its engineering team and continue developing its CPUs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding round comes as data centers are straining existing energy resources with no relief in sight. The ongoing AI boom has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/data-center-power-demand-will-double-over-the-next-five-years/\">data center power usage expected to double</a> in just the next four years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Messica hopes that NeoLogic’s energy-saving potential will help make its server CPUs too attractive for the market to ignore.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It affects everything,” Messica said of the potential energy savings. “If you talk about next-generation data centers, it affects the construction costs; it affects the amount of capital that you’ll invest because you can shave off roughly 30% of the cost. And it affects the water usage. It has an impact on society, and basically that was our vision roughly five years ago.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release/\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1955438916645130740\">post on X </a>Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5’s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside GPT-5’s new modes, Altman said that paid users can once again access several legacy AI models — including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3 — which were deprecated just last week. GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT’s settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036523\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png 2214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1200,508 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1280,542 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=430,182 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=720,305 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=900,381 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=800,339 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1536,651 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=2048,868 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=668,283 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1440,610 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=708,300 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">ChatGPT’s model picker now features several options (Credit: openai/maxwell zeff)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5’s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5’s rollout has been rougher than expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mashable.com/article/gpt-5-panned-on-reddit-sam-altman-ama?test_uuid=003aGE6xTMbhuvdzpnH5X4Q&amp;test_variant=b\">backlash among users</a> who had grown attached to the AI models’ responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5’s model router also appeared to be largely broken on launch day. That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn’t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/\">AMA session on Reddit.</a> However, it seems that GPT-5’s router may still not be satisfying for all users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1955441658050515144\">post on X</a> Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Routing prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user’s preferences, as well as the specific question they’re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast responding AI model, the response can still be fast.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Human attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn’t well understood. For example, hundreds of people in San Francisco recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/claude-3-sonnet-funeral-san-francisco/\">held a funeral</a> for Anthropic’s AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, when it was taken offline. In other cases, AI chatbots seem to be contributing to mentally unstable people going down <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html\">psychotic rabbit holes.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems OpenAI has more work to do around aligning its AI models to individual user preferences. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-launches-neuralink-to-connect-brains-with-computers-1490642652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">known until 2017</a>) and the company has made serious progress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neuralink is <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/updates/gb-prime-study-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">currently in trials</a> with people who suffer from severe paralysis.

Some might even say their tech could take humanity toward “the singularity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long before Silicon Valley became obsessed with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it was enamored with “the singularity.” Musk has used <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893810875875889507?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the term</a> to describe a time when AI surpasses human intelligence. The more classic definition (after a 1960’s novella of the same name by Dino Buzzati) means the merging of tech with humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blogged </a>about “The Merge” in 2017. “Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants,” he postulated at the time, citing research work he saw at OpenAI, where Musk was still a co-founder.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and the relationship between the two tech leaders has since disintegrated.

The fintech accounted for 6.9% of the total 18.4 billion UPI transactions in June and 5.6% of the transaction value, per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In total, Paytm processed 1.27 billion UPI transactions worth ₹1.34 trillion (approximately $15 billion).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Paytm trails PhonePe and Google Pay in the UPI market — with the duo handling over 82% of all UPI transactions in June — the company offers a broad suite of businesses and services to attract both consumers and merchants. These include offline merchant payment solutions with integrated hardware, software, and service layers, as well as a growing credit and lending business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paytm <a href=\"https://paytm.com/document/ir/financial-results/Earnings-Release_FY26-Q1-INR_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> (PDF) net income of ₹1.23 billion (approximately $14 million) for the first quarter of its financial year 2026, ending in June — a turnaround from a loss during the same period last year. The results beat expectations, as analysts had projected a loss of ₹1.27 billion (approximately $14.5 million). Revenue rose 28% year-over-year to $224 million, while the company’s contribution margin improved to 60%, up from 50% a year ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to its recent financial growth, Paytm’s shares have risen 13.25% year-to-date in 2025, signaling that the company is beginning to regain market confidence after more than a year of regulatory setbacks. The stock closed at ₹1,118.50 (approximately $13) on Wednesday, just before the regulatory approval was announced.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us! </em><a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing</em></a> a<em>nd get the chance to win a prize in return!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company was also accused of making it difficult for users to cancel their subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with the $14 million settlement, the proposed order requires Match Group to take several actions to address the issues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, the company needs to clearly spell out the details of the six-month guarantee and ensure it doesn’t take adverse actions against customers who raise billing issues. It also has to provide easy ways for users to cancel their subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The settlement comes as the company continues to face criticism over how it handles trust and safety issues. The hope is that the proposed order will help improve the experience for users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As part of the agreement, Match.com and the other evergreen and emerging brands will continue to comply with ROSCA [Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act] and make a $14 million payment, representing 5% of the FTC’s monetary demand. Match Group admits no liability as part of this resolution and was fully prepared to take the case to trial, but opted to resolve the case to put the matter behind it. The FTC’s outdated claims are entirely moot, as the alleged practices at issue ended years ago or are based on mischaracterizations that do not reflect our business today,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated to include a statement from Match Group.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The latest issue <a href=\"https://x.com/richinseattle/status/1954645281276039339\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was distributed</a> at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also known</a> as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kimsuky is a prolific <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#advanced-persistent-threat-apt\">advanced persistent threat (APT)</a> group widely believed to be working inside North Korea’s government, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/north-korea-hackers-kimsuky-strategic-intelligence/\">targeting journalists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-301a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">government agencies</a> in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea’s intelligence apparatus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apt43-north-korea-cybercrime-espionage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies</a> to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036263\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg 1130w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=768,678 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=680,600 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=430,379 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=720,635 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=900,794 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=800,706 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=668,589 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=425,375 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=699,617 699w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=602,531 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">An illustration of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which was included in the phrack article.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Saber and cyb0rg/Phrack</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obviously, what Saber and cyb0rg did is technically a crime, although they will likely never be prosecuted for it, considering North Korea is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/north-korean-hackers-blamed-for-record-spike-in-crypto-thefts-in-2025/\">sanctioned up to its eyeballs</a>.

You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda. You steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted,” the two wrote in Phrack. “You hack for all the wrong reasons.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saber and cyb0rg claim to have found evidence of Kimsuky compromising several South Korean government networks and companies, email addresses, and hacking tools used by the Kimsuky group, internal manuals, passwords, and more data. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emails sent to the addresses allegedly belonging to the hackers, which were listed in the research, went unanswered. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers wrote that they were able to identify Kim as a North Korean government hacker, thanks to “artifacts and hints” that pointed in that direction, including files configurations and domains previously attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers also noted Kim’s “strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His ultimate idea was to build <a href=\"https://continua.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Continua</a>, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The simple way to think about it is that we’re bringing the power of LLMs to group chats,” Petrou said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Continua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we’re trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Continua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it’s needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune  LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?w=680\" alt=\"Continua\" class=\"wp-image-3036344\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Erik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability.

Perplexity’s offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/08/new-doj-proposal-still-calls-for-google-to-divest-chrome-but-allows-for-ai-investments/\">Google be forced to sell Chrome</a> after a judge <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/google-loses-massive-antitrust-case-over-search/\">ruled the tech giant acted illegally</a> to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/judge-rules-google-illegally-monopolized-ad-tech-opening-door-to-potential-breakup/\">another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally </a>monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/openai-exec-says-the-company-would-buy-googles-chrome-browser-if-offered-the-chance/\">both OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/perplexity-googles-chrome-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Perplexity</a> expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Statcounter,</a> if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, the CEO of rival search engine DuckDuckGo testified in April that Chrome could be worth “upwards of $50 billion,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/google-chrome-worth-upwards-of-50-billion-browser-rival-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reported at the time</a>. Should Perplexity’s offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup’s current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-17/ai-startup-perplexity-valued-at-18-billion-with-new-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reported.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Perplexity last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">launched its own browser, called Comet,</a> in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And, by the way, last month, Perplexity also reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/18/perplexity-ai-submits-bid-to-merge-with-tiktok/\">submitted a bid to merge with TikTok.</a></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On the other hand, X reached 132 million daily active users, reflecting a 15.2% year-over-year decline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Similarweb found that X’s worldwide daily web visits are well ahead of Threads, as the Elon Musk-owned social network saw 145.8 million average daily web visits worldwide in June, while Threads had just 6.9 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Threads’ growth comes as the platform has shipped numerous new features over the past year, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/not-everyone-is-thrilled-with-threads-dms/\">DMs</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/threads-expands-open-social-web-integrations-with-fediverse-feed-user-profile-search/\">fediverse integrations</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/as-bluesky-soars-threads-rolls-out-custom-feeds-globally/\">custom feeds</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/22/taking-a-cue-from-x-threads-tests-ai-powered-summaries-of-trending-topics/\">AI enhancements</a>, and more.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The basic design of the phones will likely remain similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also expected to stay the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some areas where the Pro models may see improvement are camera and video quality, along with battery size, which could allow for faster charging and help in addressing the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pixel-10-pro-fold\">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for Google’s upcoming foldable, there are rumors suggesting it’ll have a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Additionally, Google is reportedly enhancing the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are expected to be thinner for a sleek appearance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another exciting rumor is the possibility of an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/if-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-gets-this-rumored-upgrade-ill-recommend-it-over-any-other-folding-phone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IP68 rating</a>, a first for the device. This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold will likely be powered by the new G5 chip and include the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system might also receive improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone should also likely get a bump in battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel 10 may come in Moonstone and Jade colors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pixel-watch-and-pixel-buds\">The Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Pixel Watch 3\" class=\"wp-image-2836129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg 3798w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1200,663 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1280,707 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=430,238 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=720,398 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=900,497 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=800,442 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=2048,1131 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=668,369 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1117,617 1117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=708,391 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wearables will also get their time to shine at Google’s event, with the Pixel Watch 4 rumored to get a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a strong likelihood that the smartwatch will introduce new health and fitness-tracking capabilities, possibly including an upgraded <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/07/18/pixel-watch-4-tipped-to-include-continuous-blood-oxygen-satellite-comms-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring</a> function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1940848330839654705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Leaks</a> of the Pixel Buds 2a indicate that the earbuds will come in new colors (Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry) along with <a href=\"https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953839487055720951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">features</a> like active noise cancellation.

That’s roughly five times Claude’s previous limit (200,000 tokens), and more than double the 400,000 token context window offered by OpenAI’s GPT-5.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long context will also be available for Claude Sonnet 4 through Anthropic’s cloud partners, including on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has built one of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">largest enterprise businesses</a> among AI model developers, largely by selling Claude to AI coding platforms such as Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Anysphere’s Cursor. While Claude has become the model of choice among developers, GPT-5 may threaten Anthropic’s dominance with its competitive pricing and strong coding performance. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell even helped OpenAI announce the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">launch of GPT-5</a>, which is now the default AI model for new users in Cursor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s product lead for the Claude platform, Brad Abrams, told TechCrunch in an interview that he expects AI coding platforms to get a “lot of benefit” from this update. When asked if GPT-5 put a dent in Claude’s API usage, Abrams downplayed the concern, saying he’s “really happy with the API business and the way it’s been growing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whereas OpenAI generates most of its revenue from consumer subscriptions to ChatGPT, Anthropic’s business centers around selling AI models to enterprises through an API. That’s made AI coding platforms a key customer for Anthropic and could be why the company is throwing in some new perks to attract users in the face of GPT-5.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, Anthropic unveiled an updated version of its largest AI model, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude Opus 4.1,</a> which pushed the company’s AI coding capabilities a bit further.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Generally speaking, AI models tend to perform better on all tasks when they have more context, but especially for software engineering problems. For example, if you ask an AI model to spin up a new feature for your app, it’s likely to do a better job if it can see the entire project, rather than just a small section.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abrams also told TechCrunch that Claude’s large context window helps it perform better at long agentic coding tasks, in which the AI model is autonomously working on a problem for minutes or hours. With a large context window, Claude can remember all its previous steps in long-horizon tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But some companies have taken large context windows to an extreme, claiming their AI models can process massive prompts. Google offers a 2 million token context window for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Meta offers a 10 million token context window for Llama 4 Scout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some studies suggest there’s a limit to how effective large context windows can be; AI models are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/29/geminis-data-analyzing-abilities-arent-as-good-as-google-claims/\">not great</a> at processing those massive prompts. Abrams said that Anthropic’s research team focused on increasing not just the context window for Claude, but also the “effective context window,” suggesting that its AI can understand most of the information it’s given. However, he declined to reveal Anthropic’s exact techniques.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When prompts to Claude Sonnet 4 are over 200,000 tokens, Anthropic will charge more to API users, at $6 per million input tokens and $22.50 per million output tokens (up from $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens).</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us! </em><a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing</em></a> a<em>nd get the chance to win a prize in return!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

id=\"h-how-does-edits-differ-from-capcut\">How does Edits differ from CapCut?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While both Edits and CapCut are great options for editing short-form videos, there are some differences between the two services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CapCut offers more robust editing options, including AI features, than Edits does. Of course, this can be expected since Edits is a lot newer than CapCut. Meta will likely continue to build out Edits over the next months and years, so we can expect to see more advanced functionality in the future. It’s also worth noting that CapCut has a more extensive music library compared to Edits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another difference is the fact that Edits currently doesn’t have a subscription offering (for now), but CapCut does. While CapCut offers a free version, some of its advanced tools are locked behind a paid subscription. Edits is free to use, but this will likely change in the future, as Instagram head <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DH5zeEAxgw5/?e=167cb3b3-3baa-4f70-8c08-b6735eaaa7e6&amp;g=5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Adam Mosseri has stated</a> that later versions of Edits may include paid features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, while CapCut is available on the web, Edits is mobile-only. However, this could change in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: This story originally ran in May and is updated regularly with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
