OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release/\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman said in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1955438916645130740\">post on X </a>Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5’s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside GPT-5’s new modes, Altman said that paid users can once again access several legacy AI models — including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3 — which were deprecated just last week. GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT’s settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036523\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png 2214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1200,508 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1280,542 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=430,182 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=720,305 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=900,381 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=800,339 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1536,651 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=2048,868 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=668,283 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1440,610 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=708,300 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">ChatGPT’s model picker now features several options (Credit: openai/maxwell zeff)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5’s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5’s rollout has been rougher than expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mashable.com/article/gpt-5-panned-on-reddit-sam-altman-ama?test_uuid=003aGE6xTMbhuvdzpnH5X4Q&amp;test_variant=b\">backlash among users</a> who had grown attached to the AI models’ responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5’s model router also appeared to be largely broken on launch day. That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn’t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/\">AMA session on Reddit.</a> However, it seems that GPT-5’s router may still not be satisfying for all users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1955441658050515144\">post on X</a> Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Routing prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user’s preferences, as well as the specific question they’re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast responding AI model, the response can still be fast.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Human attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn’t well understood. For example, hundreds of people in San Francisco recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/claude-3-sonnet-funeral-san-francisco/\">held a funeral</a> for Anthropic’s AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, when it was taken offline. In other cases, AI chatbots seem to be contributing to mentally unstable people going down <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html\">psychotic rabbit holes.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems OpenAI has more work to do around aligning its AI models to individual user preferences. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-launches-neuralink-to-connect-brains-with-computers-1490642652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">known until 2017</a>) and the company has made serious progress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neuralink is <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/updates/gb-prime-study-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">currently in trials</a> with people who suffer from severe paralysis. It aims to allow them to control devices with their thoughts. It <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/updates/neuralink-raises-650m-series-e/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised a $600 million Series E at a $9 billion</a> valuation in June.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neuralink (and perhaps, Merge Labs) could revolutionize how humans interact with technology. Some might even say their tech could take humanity toward “the singularity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long before Silicon Valley became obsessed with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it was enamored with “the singularity.” Musk has used <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893810875875889507?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the term</a> to describe a time when AI surpasses human intelligence. The more classic definition (after a 1960’s novella of the same name by Dino Buzzati) means the merging of tech with humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blogged </a>about “The Merge” in 2017. “Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants,” he postulated at the time, citing research work he saw at OpenAI, where Musk was still a co-founder.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and the relationship between the two tech leaders has since disintegrated. Just this week, Altman and Musk were bickering on X after <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1955094792804720660\">Altman accused Musk</a> of manipulating X and <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1955199220207784043\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Musk called Altman a liar</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ll have to wait and see when and if Merge Labs becomes formally announced.

At the time, the company said the restriction had “no material impact” on its business or revenues.

The fintech accounted for 6.9% of the total 18.4 billion UPI transactions in June and 5.6% of the transaction value, per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In total, Paytm processed 1.27 billion UPI transactions worth ₹1.34 trillion (approximately $15 billion).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Paytm trails PhonePe and Google Pay in the UPI market — with the duo handling over 82% of all UPI transactions in June — the company offers a broad suite of businesses and services to attract both consumers and merchants. These include offline merchant payment solutions with integrated hardware, software, and service layers, as well as a growing credit and lending business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paytm <a href=\"https://paytm.com/document/ir/financial-results/Earnings-Release_FY26-Q1-INR_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> (PDF) net income of ₹1.23 billion (approximately $14 million) for the first quarter of its financial year 2026, ending in June — a turnaround from a loss during the same period last year. The results beat expectations, as analysts had projected a loss of ₹1.27 billion (approximately $14.5 million). Revenue rose 28% year-over-year to $224 million, while the company’s contribution margin improved to 60%, up from 50% a year ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to its recent financial growth, Paytm’s shares have risen 13.25% year-to-date in 2025, signaling that the company is beginning to regain market confidence after more than a year of regulatory setbacks. The stock closed at ₹1,118.50 (approximately $13) on Wednesday, just before the regulatory approval was announced.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us! </em><a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing</em></a> a<em>nd get the chance to win a prize in return!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company was also accused of making it difficult for users to cancel their subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with the $14 million settlement, the proposed order requires Match Group to take several actions to address the issues. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, the company needs to clearly spell out the details of the six-month guarantee and ensure it doesn’t take adverse actions against customers who raise billing issues. It also has to provide easy ways for users to cancel their subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The settlement comes as the company continues to face criticism over how it handles trust and safety issues. The hope is that the proposed order will help improve the experience for users.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The latest issue <a href=\"https://x.com/richinseattle/status/1954645281276039339\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was distributed</a> at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also known</a> as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kimsuky is a prolific <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#advanced-persistent-threat-apt\">advanced persistent threat (APT)</a> group widely believed to be working inside North Korea’s government, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/north-korea-hackers-kimsuky-strategic-intelligence/\">targeting journalists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-301a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">government agencies</a> in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea’s intelligence apparatus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apt43-north-korea-cybercrime-espionage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies</a> to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036263\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg 1130w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=768,678 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=680,600 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=430,379 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=720,635 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=900,794 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=800,706 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=668,589 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=425,375 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=699,617 699w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=602,531 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kim-jong-un-illusration-phrack_793d66.jpg?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">An illustration of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which was included in the phrack article.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Saber and cyb0rg/Phrack</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Obviously, what Saber and cyb0rg did is technically a crime, although they will likely never be prosecuted for it, considering North Korea is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/north-korean-hackers-blamed-for-record-spike-in-crypto-thefts-in-2025/\">sanctioned up to its eyeballs</a>.

You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda. You steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted,” the two wrote in Phrack. “You hack for all the wrong reasons.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saber and cyb0rg claim to have found evidence of Kimsuky compromising several South Korean government networks and companies, email addresses, and hacking tools used by the Kimsuky group, internal manuals, passwords, and more data. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emails sent to the addresses allegedly belonging to the hackers, which were listed in the research, went unanswered. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers wrote that they were able to identify Kim as a North Korean government hacker, thanks to “artifacts and hints” that pointed in that direction, including files configurations and domains previously attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hackers also noted Kim’s “strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His ultimate idea was to build <a href=\"https://continua.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Continua</a>, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The simple way to think about it is that we’re bringing the power of LLMs to group chats,” Petrou said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Continua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we’re trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Continua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it’s needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune  LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?w=680\" alt=\"Continua\" class=\"wp-image-3036344\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Erik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability.

Perplexity’s offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/08/new-doj-proposal-still-calls-for-google-to-divest-chrome-but-allows-for-ai-investments/\">Google be forced to sell Chrome</a> after a judge <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/google-loses-massive-antitrust-case-over-search/\">ruled the tech giant acted illegally</a> to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/judge-rules-google-illegally-monopolized-ad-tech-opening-door-to-potential-breakup/\">another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally </a>monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/openai-exec-says-the-company-would-buy-googles-chrome-browser-if-offered-the-chance/\">both OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/perplexity-googles-chrome-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Perplexity</a> expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Statcounter,</a> if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, the CEO of rival search engine DuckDuckGo testified in April that Chrome could be worth “upwards of $50 billion,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/google-chrome-worth-upwards-of-50-billion-browser-rival-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reported at the time</a>. Should Perplexity’s offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup’s current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-17/ai-startup-perplexity-valued-at-18-billion-with-new-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reported.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, Perplexity last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/\">launched its own browser, called Comet,</a> in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And, by the way, last month, Perplexity also reportedly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/18/perplexity-ai-submits-bid-to-merge-with-tiktok/\">submitted a bid to merge with TikTok.</a></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On the other hand, X reached 132 million daily active users, reflecting a 15.2% year-over-year decline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Similarweb found that X’s worldwide daily web visits are well ahead of Threads, as the Elon Musk-owned social network saw 145.8 million average daily web visits worldwide in June, while Threads had just 6.9 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Threads’ growth comes as the platform has shipped numerous new features over the past year, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/not-everyone-is-thrilled-with-threads-dms/\">DMs</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/threads-expands-open-social-web-integrations-with-fediverse-feed-user-profile-search/\">fediverse integrations</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/as-bluesky-soars-threads-rolls-out-custom-feeds-globally/\">custom feeds</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/22/taking-a-cue-from-x-threads-tests-ai-powered-summaries-of-trending-topics/\">AI enhancements</a>, and more.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The basic design of the phones will likely remain similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also expected to stay the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some areas where the Pro models may see improvement are camera and video quality, along with battery size, which could allow for faster charging and help in addressing the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pixel-10-pro-fold\">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for Google’s upcoming foldable, there are rumors suggesting it’ll have a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Additionally, Google is reportedly enhancing the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are expected to be thinner for a sleek appearance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another exciting rumor is the possibility of an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/if-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-gets-this-rumored-upgrade-ill-recommend-it-over-any-other-folding-phone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IP68 rating</a>, a first for the device. This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold will likely be powered by the new G5 chip and include the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system might also receive improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone should also likely get a bump in battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel 10 may come in Moonstone and Jade colors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pixel-watch-and-pixel-buds\">The Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Pixel Watch 3\" class=\"wp-image-2836129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg 3798w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1200,663 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1280,707 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=430,238 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=720,398 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=900,497 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=800,442 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=2048,1131 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=668,369 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1117,617 1117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=708,391 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wearables will also get their time to shine at Google’s event, with the Pixel Watch 4 rumored to get a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a strong likelihood that the smartwatch will introduce new health and fitness-tracking capabilities, possibly including an upgraded <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/07/18/pixel-watch-4-tipped-to-include-continuous-blood-oxygen-satellite-comms-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring</a> function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1940848330839654705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Leaks</a> of the Pixel Buds 2a indicate that the earbuds will come in new colors (Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry) along with <a href=\"https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953839487055720951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">features</a> like active noise cancellation.

That’s roughly five times Claude’s previous limit (200,000 tokens), and more than double the 400,000 token context window offered by OpenAI’s GPT-5.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long context will also be available for Claude Sonnet 4 through Anthropic’s cloud partners, including on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic has built one of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">largest enterprise businesses</a> among AI model developers, largely by selling Claude to AI coding platforms such as Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Anysphere’s Cursor. While Claude has become the model of choice among developers, GPT-5 may threaten Anthropic’s dominance with its competitive pricing and strong coding performance. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell even helped OpenAI announce the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">launch of GPT-5</a>, which is now the default AI model for new users in Cursor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s product lead for the Claude platform, Brad Abrams, told TechCrunch in an interview that he expects AI coding platforms to get a “lot of benefit” from this update. When asked if GPT-5 put a dent in Claude’s API usage, Abrams downplayed the concern, saying he’s “really happy with the API business and the way it’s been growing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whereas OpenAI generates most of its revenue from consumer subscriptions to ChatGPT, Anthropic’s business centers around selling AI models to enterprises through an API. That’s made AI coding platforms a key customer for Anthropic and could be why the company is throwing in some new perks to attract users in the face of GPT-5.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, Anthropic unveiled an updated version of its largest AI model, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude Opus 4.1,</a> which pushed the company’s AI coding capabilities a bit further.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Generally speaking, AI models tend to perform better on all tasks when they have more context, but especially for software engineering problems. For example, if you ask an AI model to spin up a new feature for your app, it’s likely to do a better job if it can see the entire project, rather than just a small section.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Abrams also told TechCrunch that Claude’s large context window helps it perform better at long agentic coding tasks, in which the AI model is autonomously working on a problem for minutes or hours. With a large context window, Claude can remember all its previous steps in long-horizon tasks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But some companies have taken large context windows to an extreme, claiming their AI models can process massive prompts. Google offers a 2 million token context window for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Meta offers a 10 million token context window for Llama 4 Scout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some studies suggest there’s a limit to how effective large context windows can be; AI models are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/29/geminis-data-analyzing-abilities-arent-as-good-as-google-claims/\">not great</a> at processing those massive prompts. Abrams said that Anthropic’s research team focused on increasing not just the context window for Claude, but also the “effective context window,” suggesting that its AI can understand most of the information it’s given. However, he declined to reveal Anthropic’s exact techniques.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When prompts to Claude Sonnet 4 are over 200,000 tokens, Anthropic will charge more to API users, at $6 per million input tokens and $22.50 per million output tokens (up from $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens).</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us! </em><a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing</em></a> a<em>nd get the chance to win a prize in return!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

id=\"h-how-does-edits-differ-from-capcut\">How does Edits differ from CapCut?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While both Edits and CapCut are great options for editing short-form videos, there are some differences between the two services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CapCut offers more robust editing options, including AI features, than Edits does. Of course, this can be expected since Edits is a lot newer than CapCut. Meta will likely continue to build out Edits over the next months and years, so we can expect to see more advanced functionality in the future. It’s also worth noting that CapCut has a more extensive music library compared to Edits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another difference is the fact that Edits currently doesn’t have a subscription offering (for now), but CapCut does. While CapCut offers a free version, some of its advanced tools are locked behind a paid subscription. Edits is free to use, but this will likely change in the future, as Instagram head <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DH5zeEAxgw5/?e=167cb3b3-3baa-4f70-8c08-b6735eaaa7e6&amp;g=5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Adam Mosseri has stated</a> that later versions of Edits may include paid features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, while CapCut is available on the web, Edits is mobile-only. However, this could change in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update: This story originally ran in May and is updated regularly with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users code an application once and Uno Platform makes it easy to ship other types of applications from the existing codebase.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re coding something once and it works on five different platforms on desktop, web, and mobile, you’re getting 5x the productivity already,” Uno Platform co-founder and CEO Francois Tanguay told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uno Platform is not the only app developer tool platform available, but Tanguay thinks it stands out in a market flooded by vibe coding platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/eight-months-in-swedish-unicorn-lovable-crosses-the-100m-arr-milestone/\">Lovable</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">Cursor</a>. For Tanguay, enterprise developers should have access to productivity tools too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everything we are shipping hasn’t been done before and we like we have a clear road map in terms of how we can add those extra capabilities [to] make everybody 10x faster,” Tanguay said. “Nobody’s capturing that market yet in the enterprise space.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 2-year-old startup’s enterprise focus has attracted customers and investors. Uno Platform just raised a C$3.5 million ($2.54 million) seed funding round co-led by AQC Capital and Desjardins Capital, with participation from Scott Hanselman, the vice president of Microsoft’s developer community, in addition to other angel investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The capital will help Uno roll out its premium tooling tier, Uno Platform Studio, and new feature, “Hot Design” which allows developers to pause a running application and change its user interface in real time.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tanguay said they wanted to build Uno Platform to be as seamless to use and helpful as working with a consulting agency, which is exactly how the company got started in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tanguay founded <a href=\"https://nventive.com/en/about-us/our-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nventive</a> in 2008 as a consulting agency to build apps for companies right as apps were becoming the next hot technology. After a few years, Nventive started developing the suite of tools that eventually became Uno Platform because the agency was looking for ways to make itself more efficient, Tanguay said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nventive launched Uno Platform as an open source toolbox in 2018. The open source community could help the agency keep up with frequently changing operating systems that were constantly releasing new versions that required Uno Platform to tweak its offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have over a hundred million downloads of the platform, something we wouldn’t have been able to do just by ourselves,” Tanguay said. “It was really betting on the open source, as a community, to help grow that initiative and bet that others would see the same value in having access to a toolbox like this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tanguay was right and the company has more than 300 open source contributors. Nventive decided to fully spin out the tool box and created Uno Platform in 2023. Since then, the company has started working with enterprise customers, including Toyota, Microsoft, and TradeZero, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The AI giant said Tuesday it would also offer its Claude models to government agencies for just $1 — but not only to the executive branch. Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/us-adds-openai-google-and-anthropic-to-list-of-approved-ai-vendors-for-federal-agencies/\">OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind</a> were added to the General Services Administration’s list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic will also provide technical support to help agencies integrate AI tools into their workflows, according to the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic, along with OpenAI, xAI, and Google, has been granted up to $200 million by the Department of Defense to leverage AI for national security, but the AI firm clearly hopes to integrate into a broader array of government work, including science research and health services. Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic’s multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us! </em><a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing</em></a> a<em>nd get the chance to win a prize in return!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Sure, you can AirPlay them to the TV, but the experience is not the same. This struggle inspired developer Devin Davies to create <a href=\"https://thecassetteapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cassette</a>, a new iOS app that plays back videos in a format similar to VHS, making your iPhone videos feel more like old home recordings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the app, you virtually “load” one of the tapes laid out across the screen by selecting the year’s videos you want to view.

You tap on one to virtually “load” it into the TV icon at the top of the iPhone’s screen to start playing the video. With AirPlay, you can also mirror your device to a TV to watch the full experience play out on the big screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The videos themselves include a location, date, and timestamp displayed in a retro pixel font that looks like the old screen fonts used on VHS tapes. (Even if you’re too young to remember VHS tapes, seeing old videos in this format pulls on the heartstrings. That could be because old home movies are still regularly referenced in modern movies and TV shows during sentimental moments and scenes.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, there were some challenges that the app still needs to overcome. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you have a habit of downloading online videos, like TikToks or Reels, these will show up among your “home movies.” However, Davies tells TechCrunch that the app is already filtering out screen recordings, and he’s now looking to see if TikTok videos could be filtered out, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To support its development, Cassette offers an optional premium subscription (dubbed “ColorPlus”) that allows users to manually select a VHS tape instead of having the app play a video at random. This costs either $0.99 per month or $5.99 per year. There’s also an affordable Lifetime unlock for $7.99, which can go a long way toward supporting indie projects like this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app is a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cassette-home-video-player/id6475023019\">free download for iPhone and iPad</a>. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

More than 700 motors have already passed static test firing. These motors are used for a range of kinetic weapons, like missile interceptors, and even deep-space probes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A handful of promising startups are pushing behind them as demand soars for weapons in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and mounting tensions in the South China Sea. The Defense Department has been keen to bolster American arsenals, awarding millions in funding to new entrants like Ursa Major and X-Bow Systems to take their products from prototype to commercialization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As more SRM manufacturers come online, the vulnerability of another segment of the supply chain becomes even more apparent. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every one of the motors these companies produce still needs ammonium perchlorate (AP), a powerful oxidizer that is made at scale by just one qualified producer: American Pacific, or AMPAC, in Utah.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Northrop Grumman, a manufacturer of weapons that use SRMs, has invested more than $100 million to establish an AP production line, but that production has been slow to scale due to the military’s high standards for certification, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/northrops-rocket-fuel-factory-is-slow-to-take-off-57aa7a27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> last year. Northrop did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AP supply chain is a chokepoint felt by suppliers, including Anduril. The risks remain the same, like accidents and fires that have the ability to destroy important assets, but the company believes the restoration of a second supplier is vital, and would welcome additional suppliers, according to the company. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is not a new issue, but as the SRM duopoly held by Northrop Grumman and L3Harris’ Aerojet Rocketdyne is increasingly challenged by Anduril and others, it highlights a vulnerability in the supply chain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jerry McGinn, a former senior industrial base official in the Department of Defense, said the need for multiple suppliers of AP dwindled as the demand for SRMs collapsed in the 1990s. The Pentagon backed a “merger-to-monopoly” in the 1990s, preferring to have one healthy provider rather than two struggling companies that couldn’t be competitive without government subsidies, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today’s single-source risk is less about capacity than about the demand signal resurgence, he argued. “Capacity is never the issue,” he said. “It’s just enough orders and lead time to create the fuel.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AMPAC announced in April that its parent company would invest $100 million in a new AP production line, which would increase capacity by 50%. The project is scheduled to be complete next year, a tight deadline even if everything goes to plan. AMPAC did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the status of that new line. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Balancing demand and lead time is delicate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pentagon acquisition chief Bill LaPlante called it “the tyranny of lead time” when speaking to lawmakers in February, warning against the “feast-or-famine” procurement behavior of times past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Industry also reasonably remains reluctant to build additional capacity “at risk” until they have a clear, consistent demand signal from DoD, often with specific procurement quantities for multiple years,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For its part, Ursa Major touted its additive manufacturing process to avoid the pitfalls that slow conventional manufacturing approaches, a spokesperson said. But even the most innovatively made motors will still need AP to burn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Funding for SRM manufacturing is part of a larger push to fund the industrial base. To McGinn, if Washington can prototype the motors, it should be able to prototype AP, too.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If developing a second source is imperative, then the government should focus on that by doing what they did with Ursa Major, X-Bow, and so on — by doing prototype efforts with other companies to develop another source of AP,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Uber’s partnership with Waabi isn’t affected by Ron’s departure, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While working at Uber Freight, Ron says, he met regularly with chief supply chain officers and big carriers that he said “could not wait” for self-driving trucks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the most impactful thing to do in the next decade is autonomy, and if the timing is right, then for me it’s really about joining forces with who I think is most positioned to lead the transformation,” he added. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urtasun claims Waabi’s “AI-first” approach to scaling autonomy has allowed it to do more with fewer resources and in less time than competitors. Given this is a capital-intensive industry that’s seen several promising startups, like TuSimple and Embark, crash and burn, efficiency can be a major advantage.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since it was founded in 2021, Waabi has raised $287.7 million in total, the bulk of which came from a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/waabis-genai-promises-to-do-so-much-more-than-power-self-driving-trucks/\">$200 million Series B in 2024</a>. Urtasun claims the company doesn’t need to raise more to get to its next phase of growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s chief competitor is Aurora, which this year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/01/aurora-launches-commercial-self-driving-truck-service-in-texas/\">launched the first commercial driverless trucking route</a> in the U.S., and has raised nearly $3.46 billion through a combination of venture capital and its public listing. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waabi has managed to launch commercial pilots quickly because it does most training, testing, and validation in Waabi World, its closed-loop simulator that both virtually tests the self-driving software and teaches it in real time. More recently, Waabi took its simulator to the test track, overlaying virtual environments onto real-world driving conditions to simulate scenarios like accidents and construction zones without the actual risk, according to Urtasun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the beginning of the year, we reached feature complete, which basically means we have all the necessary things to remove the driver and [are focused] on the final performance improvement and validation,” Urtasun said. “We are on track for our driverless launch by the end of the year, which is the start of commercialization.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup plans to launch in Texas, which has become the autonomous freight capital of the U.S., but it hasn’t yet disclosed which routes it’ll operate on or with which launch partners. The startup is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/waabi-and-volvo-team-up-to-build-self-driving-trucks-at-scale/\">working with Volvo Autonomous Solutions</a> to develop and deploy custom-built AVs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Waabi will lead the technology and it will scale autonomy faster than ever expected,” Ron said, adding that he’s excited with the prospect of integrating the technology into the customers’ operations. Part of that is a feature that would enable Waabi’s trucks to drive straight to customer depots, avoiding the need to build terminals for a hybrid setup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re going to create a commercial-ready solution that can really meet them,” Ron said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!
