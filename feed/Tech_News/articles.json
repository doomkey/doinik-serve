Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round also included significant investments from Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Capital, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Additional investors included BDT &amp; MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said the funds will be used to fuel its growth, which has accelerated over the past year and doesn’t appear to be slowing. The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-sfo-airport-robotaxis/\">recently secured rides</a> to and from San Francisco International Airport and has expanded its robotaxi service throughout Northern California and several major metropolitan areas in the U.S. including Los Angeles, Austin, and Miami.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, the former Google self-driving project slowly progressed forward, testing its autonomous vehicle tech on public roads in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area and providing the occasional public or media demo. In 2016, it made its first geographic leap forward and began testing in Phoenix, where it eventually pulled its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/18/waymo-is-expanding-its-driverless-program-in-phoenix/\">human safety driver</a> out of the vehicles. Phoenix became Waymo’s first robotaxi market, in which the public could hail driverless Chrysler Pacific minivans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo pushed down the accelerator in August 2023 after receiving the final necessary permit to operate a robotaxi service — and charge for rides — in California. It launched a limited service in San Francisco, later expanding to much of the greater Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and more recently to the freeways that connect the dozens of towns in the area. It also expanded to Los Angeles. The company launched in Austin and Atlanta in 2025 through a partnership with Uber. It kicked off the year by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/waymo-continues-robotaxi-ramp-up-with-miami-service-now-open-to-public/\">expanding to Miami</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The geographic expansion has translated to 400,000 rides provided every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas. The company said in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides, surpassing 20 million lifetime rides to date. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are no longer proving a concept,” the company wrote in its blog post. “We are scaling a commercial reality, laying the groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including Tokyo and London.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The rapid expansion has also led to increased scrutiny and criticism as Waymo’s robotaxis have made missteps and the technology <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/we-talked-to-the-guy-who-was-stuck-in-a-waymo-robotaxi-on-an-dizzying-loop/\">creates problems</a> for some residents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some robotaxis have exhibited dangerous behaviors particularly in school zones. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation as well as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/\">opened investigations</a> into the illegal behavior of Waymo robotaxis around school buses. NHTSA also launched another investigation last week after a Waymo robotaxi <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/waymo-robotaxi-hits-a-child-near-an-elementary-school-in-santa-monica/\">hit a child</a> near a school.

Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” he wrote. (xAI has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/memphis-xai-colossus-elon-musk-chamber-messaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">imposing some of that hardship</a> on the communities near its data centers in Memphis, Tennessee.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up values the combined company at $1.25 trillion, according to Bloomberg News, which was first to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo\">report the complet</a><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">e</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo\">d deal</a>. SpaceX has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/elon-musk-reportedly-wants-a-june-spacex-ipo-to-align-with-his-birthday-the-planets/\">reportedly</a> preparing an IPO for as early as June of this year. It’s unclear whether the merger will affect that timeline. Musk did not address the IPO in his public memo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The merger brings together two of Musk’s companies, each with its own financial challenges. xAI is currently burning <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">around $1 billion per month</a>, according to Bloomberg. SpaceX, meanwhile, generates as much as 80% of its revenue from launching its own Starlink satellites, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/spacex-generated-about-8-billion-profit-last-year-ahead-ipo-sources-say-2026-01-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Reuters</a>.

(That revenue loop likely looks even more attractive when you consider that satellites are required to be de-orbited every five years by the Federal Communications Commission.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While space data centers may be the stated goal, SpaceX and xAI have very different near-term objectives. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX is currently trying to prove that its Starship rocket is capable of bringing astronauts to the moon and Mars, while xAI is competing with leading artificial intelligence companies like Google and OpenAI.

The new rules, which go in effect January 1, 2027, will prohibit the hidden, electronically actuated door handles popularized by Tesla — and now found on numerous other electric vehicles in China.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new rule dictates that each door (excluding the tailgate) should be equipped with a mechanically released external door handle. Vehicles must also have a mechanical release on the interior of the vehicle. Bloomberg <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/china-bans-hidden-car-door-handles-in-world-first-safety-policy\">previously reported</a> on the new safety policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Numerous high-profile fatal incidents, in which occupants have become trapped in their vehicles, have raised concerns among safety regulators and advocates globally. China is the first country to issue a ban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/\">investigation by Bloomberg</a> last September uncovered problems with the concealed door handles on Tesla vehicles, citing several crashes in which first responders or occupants were unable to open the doors because the electronic door locks weren’t getting enough power from the vehicle’s battery system to work properly. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration then opened a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE25010\">defect investigation </a>into certain Tesla Model Y and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-24/tesla-faces-new-nhtsa-probe-over-model-3-emergency-door-handles\">Model 3</a> door handles. While Tesla does have manual releases inside its vehicles, federal investigators noted that the releases can be hard for children to access, and many owners are unaware of their existence. Some U.S. lawmakers have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/us-lawmaker-readies-bill-requiring-manual-door-handles-in-cars\">proposed regulation</a> requiring manual door releases in all new vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fatal incidents in China, including a crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 electric sedan, prompted regulators there to propose changes to EV door handles last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Chinese government began the process in May 2025 with more than 40 domestic vehicle manufacturers, parts suppliers, and testing institutions participating in the initial research. More than 100 industry experts held multiple rounds of discussions to determine the standard framework and form a draft standard of what would become the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://std.samr.gov.cn/gb/search/gbDetailed?id=4984F354F9F8CAD1E06397BE0A0AA46C\">Safety Technical Requirements for Automobile Door Handles</a> rule, according to the Chinese government’s standards agency.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That included dozens of automakers, including Chinese companies such as BYD, Geely Holdings, SAIC, and Xiaomi as well as foreign automakers including General Motors, Ford, Hyundai, Nissan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

On Monday, Adobe issued an <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/release-notes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">update</a> to the company’s support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing Adobe Animate will be discontinued on March 1, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise customers can continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition. Other customers will have support through March of next year, the company said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision has been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1qu41ca/adobe_is_planning_to_discontinue_animate_next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">met</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=adobe%20animate&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with</a> incredulity, disappointment, and anger among Adobe Animate users, who are concerned about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One customer, <a href=\"https://x.com/TylerGlaiel/status/2018394595340771653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posting on X</a>, pleaded with Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things <a href=\"https://x.com/ThisIsWronchi/status/2018404802510630914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like</a> “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” <a href=\"https://x.com/Ari4472/status/2018406974589722819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">and</a> “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/animate/kb/end-of-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FAQ</a>, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reading between the lines, it sounds as if Adobe is saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s surprising is that Adobe can’t even recommend software that will fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it says customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, it suggests that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction after Animate was ignored at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software will continue to work for those who have it downloaded, Adobe noted. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some users are recommending other animation programs to use instead, including <a href=\"https://moho.lostmarble.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Moho Animation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.toonboom.com/products/harmony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Toon Boom Harmony.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Adobe for comment.

Scott said what makes their accelerator different is that it is specifically built “for student founders by student founders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Student programs like this aren’t new.

Even Stanford has some accelerator programs, both run by or affiliated with the school, such as StartX, LaunchPad, and Cardinal Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Students have enjoyed how we’ve brought together so many others from different American colleges,” Nafi said of his program, comparing it to Stanford’s Treehacks hackathon. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Breakthrough’s purpose is to fill in the funding and opportunity gap that exists in many of these ecosystems because students have historically lacked access to capital and the networks required to launch their entrepreneurial pursuits,” Scott added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Breakthrough will have a hybrid model, with in-person meetups at local powerhouse VC firms, culminating in a Demo Day at Stanford. Those participating in the program get access to grant funding (up to $100,000), compute credits (through Microsoft and the Nvidia Inception program), legal support, Waymo ride credits, mentorship (from Waymo CEO Tekedra Mawakana, among others), “along with the opportunity to receive a $50,000 follow-on investment at the conclusion of the program,” Nafi said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve nailed the student-founder experience to a T,” Nafi said. “Hence why we offer the resources we do and have structured the program in this way.

Snowflake employees have access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise as well. The two companies are also partnering to build new AI agents and other AI products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By bringing OpenAI models to enterprise data, Snowflake enables organizations to build and deploy AI on top of their most valuable asset using the secure, governed platform they already trust,” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a press release. “Customers can now harness all their enterprise knowledge in Snowflake together with the world-class intelligence of OpenAI models, enabling them to build AI agents that are powerful, responsible, and trustworthy. Together, we’re setting a new standard for AI innovation, helping businesses transform with confidence, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI declined to share information on the deal beyond the press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If this deal feels familiar, it should. Snowflake announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/anthropic-signs-200m-deal-to-bring-its-llms-to-snowflakes-customers/\">$200 million enterprise deal with AI research lab Anthropic</a> at the beginning of December. At the time, Ramaswamy was quoted making very similar comments about how the partnership with Anthropic would give its customers access to powerful AI models on top of their existing data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our partnership with OpenAI is a multi-year commercial commitment focused on reliability, performance, and real customer usage. At the same time, we remain intentionally model-agnostic. Enterprises need choice, and we do not believe in locking customers into a single provider,” Baris Gultekin, vice president of AI at Snowflake, told TechCrunch over email. “OpenAI is an important partner, and it is one of several frontier model providers available on Snowflake today, alongside Anthropic, Google, Meta, and others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snowflake isn’t the only enterprise signing sizable deals with multiple AI companies either.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, workflow automation platform ServiceNow <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/servicenow-inks-another-ai-partnership-this-time-with-anthropic/\">announced multi-year deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic</a> for very similar reasons as Snowflake. ServiceNow president, COO, and CPO Amit Zavery told TechCrunch at the time that working with both AI labs was deliberate because they wanted to give their customers and employees the ability to choose which model they wanted based on the task at hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to pinpoint which AI companies are seeing the most enterprise adoption success thus far. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Menlo Ventures survey</a> from late 2025 shows its portfolio company Anthropic holds a commanding market lead; an <a href=\"https://a16z.com/leaders-gainers-and-unexpected-winners-in-the-enterprise-ai-arms-race/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Andreessen Horowitz report</a> from last week naturally found its portfolio company OpenAI is leading the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These conflicting surveys make it difficult to accurately track enterprise AI usage trends. However, this latest string of deals does provide a short-term view of what enterprise AI adoption will look like. The upshot: Enterprises will continue to strike partnerships with multiple AI companies because each one offers large language models with varying strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprises are likely going to partner with multiple AI players because different AI companies and their large language models come with their own strengths and weaknesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enterprise AI could easily become a market that contains several winners with an overlapping customer base, similar to how many ride-hail users swap between Lyft and Uber based on what makes the most sense for that moment. Case in point: Employees of these enterprises already use their preferred model regardless of their company contracts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> Or maybe there will be a clear winner after all. But for now, it’s likely we are going to see enterprises ink deals with multiple players as they continue to hunt for where AI can deliver tangible value.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, Mozilla <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-controls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> that Firefox will soon let users block all current and future generative AI features. Users will also have the option to block certain AI features in Firefox, while keeping others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Starting with Firefox 148, which is rolling out on February 24, users will find a new AI controls section within the desktop browser settings. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People who don’t want access to any AI features from Firefox can turn on the “Block AI enhancements” toggle. When this setting is turned on, they won’t see pop-ups or reminders to use existing or upcoming AI features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new AI controls will also let users manage AI features individually. These features include “Translations,” which allows you to browse the web in your preferred language, Alt text in PDFs, AI-enhanced tab grouping, link previews, and Firefox’s AI chatbot in the sidebar, which lets you use your chosen chatbot as you browse, including services like Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI is changing the web, and people want very different things from it,” the company wrote in a blog post. “We’ve heard from many who want nothing to do with AI. We’ve also heard from others who want AI tools that are genuinely useful. Listening to our community, alongside our ongoing commitment to offer choice, led us to build AI controls.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement comes as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/mozillas-new-ceo-says-ai-is-coming-to-firefox-but-will-remain-a-choice/\">Mozilla appointed Anthony Enzor-DeMeo</a> as its CEO back in December. Enzor-DeMeo said at the time that Mozilla would be investing in AI and would add AI features to Firefox, but that the company would make these features optional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it,” he wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enzor-DeMeo’s comments come as Mozilla scrambles to adapt in a rapidly changing browser market. Although browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome dominated the browser space for more than a decade, they are facing renewed competition from companies such as Perplexity, Arc, OpenAI, and Opera.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Mozilla plans to invest in new AI features, it’s also focused on transparency. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/mozilla-building-an-ai-rebel-alliance-to-take-on-openai-anthropic-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC reported</a> last week that Mozilla President Mark Surman said he’s building “a rebel alliance of sorts” made up of tech startups, developers, and public-interest technologists committed to making AI more trustworthy and to checking the power of players like OpenAI and Anthropic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mozilla will deploy around $1.4 billion worth of reserves to support tech businesses and nonprofits, including its own, CNBC reports. The company is pursuing investments that promote AI transparency and push back against companies growing at historic speeds with limited oversight. <br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This initiative could deliver significant cost savings for customers and may increase Grubhub’s appeal in a fiercely competitive market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Super Bowl advertisement stars actor George Clooney at an extravagant dinner party. As the host dramatically asks, “Who will eat the fees?” Clooney responds, “Grubhub will eat the fees.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyvGh2-Gsdg?si=7VG2PpbF_ErYbURE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Grubhub says this is a permanent offering aimed at putting more money back in customers’ pockets amid challenging economic times. The company notes that delivery and service fees on orders over $50 usually average about $13 per transaction across food delivery apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Grubhub’s move to permanently eliminate fees on all orders over $50 stands out as a unique offer in the food delivery space. Neither DoorDash nor Uber Eats offers a permanent waiver of delivery and service fees on large orders. Their promotions are typically limited-time offers or tied to paid subscription services (such as DashPass or Uber One), which often apply only to select restaurants or are subject to other restrictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, this new offering comes as Grubhub faces challenges in user growth and trails behind its competitors.

But as developers experiment with new interfaces and form factors for human-AI collaboration, it’s become hard for even the most advanced AI labs to keep up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The current trend is for agentic software development — systems where AI agents can work independently on coding tasks — epitomized by the Claude Code and Cowork apps. In the meantime, OpenAI has been gradually building out its Codex tool, which launched as <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/codex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a command line tool</a> last April and <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded to a web interface</a> one month later.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now OpenAI is taking a major step toward catching up. On Monday, the company launched a new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">macOS app</a> for Codex, integrating many of the agentic practices that have become popular in the past year. The new app is designed to work with multiple agents in parallel, integrating <a href=\"https://agentskills.io/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">agent skills</a> and other state-of-the-art workflows. The launch also comes less than two months after <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2-codex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the launch of GPT-5.2-Codex</a>, OpenAI’s most powerful coding model, which the company hopes will be enough to tempt over Claude Code users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you really want to do sophisticated work on something complex, 5.2 is the strongest model by far,” CEO Sam Altman told reporters on a press call. “However, it’s been harder to use, so taking that level of model capability and putting it in a more flexible interface, we think is going to matter quite a bit.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Altman’s confidence in GPT-5.2 is understandable, coding benchmarks tell a more complicated story. GPT-5.2 does hold <a href=\"https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the top spot on TerminalBench</a> (a test measuring how well AI handles command-line programming tasks), at least as of press time. But agents from Gemini 3 and Claude Opus have logged roughly equivalent scores — lower, but within the margin of error of the benchmark. Results from <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SWE-bench</a>, another coding benchmark that tests AI’s ability to fix real-world software bugs, are similar, showing no clear advantage for GPT-5.2. However, agentic use cases have been difficult to benchmark effectively, and state-of-the-art models can vary significantly in user experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Codex app also comes with a range of new features that OpenAI says will help it achieve parity or, in some cases, outpace the various Claude apps. The Codex app will allow for automations that can be set to run in the background on an automatic schedule, with results placed in a queue to be reviewed when the user returns. Users can also select different personalities for the agent — from pragmatic to empathetic — depending on their working style.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But for the company, the biggest selling point is the sheer speed of development that’s made possible by AI. “You can use this from a clean sheet of paper, brand new, to make a really quite sophisticated piece of software in a few hours,” Altman said. “As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Ho said this “would explain the highly selective targeting” seen during the campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rapid7, which <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">investigated the incident</a>, attributed the hacking to Lotus Blossom, a long-running espionage group known to work for China, and said the hacks targeted government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notepad++ is one of the longest-running open source projects, spanning more than two decades, and it counts at least tens of millions of downloads to date, including by employees at organizations around the world.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who <a href=\"https://doublepulsar.com/small-numbers-of-notepad-users-reporting-security-woes-371d7a3fd2d9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first discovered the cyberattack and wrote up his findings</a> in December, the hackers compromised a small number of organizations “with interests in East Asia” after someone unwittingly used a tainted version of the popular software. Beaumont said that the hackers were able to gain “hands-on” access to the computers of victims who were running hijacked versions of Notepad++. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ho said that the “exact technical mechanism” of how the hackers broke into his servers remains under investigation, but provided some details as to how the attack went down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the blog, Ho said that Notepad++’s website was hosted on a shared hosting server. The attackers “specifically targeted” Notepad++’s web domain with the goal of exploiting a bug in the software to redirect some users to a malicious server run by the hackers. This allowed the hackers to deliver malicious updates to certain users who had requested a software update, until the <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v889-released/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bug was fixed in November</a> and the hackers’ access was terminated in early December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented,” wrote Ho. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an email, Ho told TechCrunch that his hosting provider confirmed his shared server was compromised but that the provider did not say how the hackers initially broke in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ho apologized for the incident, and urged users to download the <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.9.1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most recent version</a> of his software, which contains a fix for the bug.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cyberattack targeting Notepad++ users is somewhat reminiscent of the 2019-2020 cyberattack affecting customers of SolarWinds, a software company that makes IT and network management tools for large Fortune 500 organizations, including government departments. Russian government spies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/\">hacked into the company’s servers</a> and secretly planted a backdoor in its software, allowing the Russian spies to access data on those customers’ networks once the update had rolled out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The SolarWinds breach affected several government agencies, including Homeland Security and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice, and State.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated with a response from Ho and with additional details from Rapid7.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They’ll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed. The company is now making Search Party accessible to anyone through the Ring app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now, pet owners can mobilize the whole community—and communities are empowered to help—to find lost pets more effectively than ever before,” noted Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, in an <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-search-party-for-dogs-united-states-missing-pets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a>. “That’s why we believe it’s so important to make this feature available to anyone who shares a lost dog post in Neighbors,” he added, referring to the company’s Neighbors app for Ring customers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Search Party | A New Way to Neighbor\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQMuDtsLv0g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside the launch and expansion, Amazon-owned Ring said it’s committing $1 million to equip animal shelters with Ring camera systems, and aims to aid 4,000 U.S. shelters.

This model recognizes plant species instantly and allows farmers to target new weeds without needing to retrain the robots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The LPM is trained on more than 150 million photos and data points collected by the company’s machines across the more than 100 farms in 15 countries where the robots currently operate. The model now powers Carbon AI, the AI system that serves as the brains inside the company’s autonomous weed-killing robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paul Mikesell, the founder and CEO of Carbon Robotics, told TechCrunch that prior to LPM, every time a new type of weed would show up on a farm — or even the same type of weed in different soil or with a slightly different appearance — the company would have to create new data labels to retrain its machines to recognize the plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This process took about 24 hours each time, Mikesell said. Now, LPM can learn a new weed instantly, even if it’s never seen it before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The farmer can live in real time and say, ‘Hey, this is a new weed. I want you to kill this,’ and that was something that had never been done before,” Mikesell said. “There’s no new labeling or retraining because the Large Plant Model understands, at a much deeper level, what it’s looking at and the type of plant.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mikesell said that the company, which was founded in 2018, started developing this model shortly after it began shipping its first machines in 2022. Mikesell has years of experience building these types of neural networks from previous roles at Uber and working on Meta’s Oculus virtual reality headsets.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new model will reach the company’s existing systems through a software update. From there, farmers can tell the machine what to kill and what to protect by selecting photos that the machine has collected in the robot’s user interface.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Carbon Robotics has raised more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/11/carbons-laser-weeding-robots-score-another-30-million/\">$185 million in venture capital</a> from backers including Nvidia NVentures, Bond, and Anthos Capital, among others. Now, the company will look to continue to fine-tune the model as the machines continue to feed the LPM new data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have over 150 million labeled plants now in our training set,” Mikesell said. “We have enough data now that we should be able to look at any picture and decide what kind of plant that is, what species it is, what it’s related to, what its structure is like, without having ever even seen that particular plant before, because we have so much data going into the neural net.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to some reports, Grok generated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">thousands</a> of nonconsensual explicit images every hour, which were then disseminated at scale on X, Musk’s social media platform that’s owned by xAI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is deeply concerning that the federal government would continue to deploy an AI product with system-level failures resulting in generation of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material,” the letter, signed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen, Center for AI and Digital Policy, and Consumer Federation of America, reads. “Given the administration’s executive orders, guidance, and the recently passed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/trump-signs-bill-criminalizing-revenge-porn-and-explicit-deepfakes/\">Take It Down Act</a> supported by the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/icymi-president-trump-signs-take-it-down-act-into-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">White House</a>, it is alarming that [Office of Management and Budget] has not yet directed federal agencies to decommission Grok.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI reached an agreement last September with the General Services Administration (GSA), the government’s purchasing arm, to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/elon-musks-xai-offers-grok-to-federal-government-for-42-cents/\">sell Grok to federal agencies</a> under the executive branch. Two months before, xAI — alongside Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI — secured a contract worth up to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/14/xai-pentagon-grok-contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$200 million</a> with the Department of Defense. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid the scandals on X in mid-January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Grok will join Google’s Gemini in <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pentagon-embraces-musks-grok-ai-chatbot-as-it-draws-global-outcry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">operating inside the Pentagon network</a>, handling both classified and unclassified documents, which experts say is a national security risk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter’s authors argue that Grok has proven itself incompatible with the administration’s requirements for AI systems. According to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-22-Driving-Efficient-Acquisition-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Government.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OMB’s guidance</a>, systems that present severe and foreseeable risks that cannot be adequately mitigated must be discontinued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our primary concern is that Grok has pretty consistently shown to be an unsafe large language model,” JB Branch, a Public Citizen Big Tech accountability advocate and one of the letter’s authors, told TechCrunch. “But there’s also a deep history of Grok having a variety of meltdowns, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/18/grok-says-its-skeptical-about-holocaust-death-toll-then-blames-programming-error/\">antisemitic</a> rants, sexist rants, sexualized images of women and children.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several governments have demonstrated an unwillingness to engage with Grok following its behavior in January, which builds on a series of incidents including the generation of antisemitic posts on X and calling itself “MechaHitler.” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">Indonesia, Malaysia</a>, and the Philippines all blocked access to Grok (they’ve <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/indonesia-conditionally-lifts-ban-on-grok/\">subsequently lifted those bans</a>), and the European Union, the U.K., South Korea, and India are actively investigating xAI and X regarding data privacy and the distribution of illegal content. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter also comes a week after Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews media and tech for families, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/among-the-worst-weve-seen-report-slams-xais-grok-over-child-safety-failures/\">published a damning risk assessment</a> that found Grok is among the most unsafe for kids and teens. One could argue that, based on the findings of the report — including Grok’s propensity to offer unsafe advice, share information about drugs, generate violent and sexual imagery, spew conspiracy theories, and generate biased outputs — Grok isn’t all that safe for adults either.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you know that a large language model is or has been declared unsafe by AI safety experts, why in the world would you want that handling the most sensitive data we have?” Branch said. “From a national security standpoint, that just makes absolutely no sense.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andrew Christianson, a former National Security Agency contractor and current founder of <a href=\"https://gobii.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gobbi AI</a>, a no-code AI agent platform for classified environments, says that using closed-source LLMs in general is a problem, particularly for the Pentagon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Closed weights means you can’t see inside the model, you can’t audit how it makes decisions,” he said. “Closed code means you can’t inspect the software or control where it runs. The Pentagon is going closed on both, which is the worst possible combination for national security.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These AI agents aren’t just chatbots,” Christianson added. “They can take actions, access systems, move information around. You need to be able to see exactly what they’re doing and how they’re making decisions. Open source gives you that. Proprietary cloud AI doesn’t.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The risks of using corrupted or unsafe AI systems spill out beyond national security use cases. Branch pointed out that an LLM that’s been shown to have biased and discriminatory outputs could produce disproportionate negative outcomes for people as well, especially if used in departments involving housing, labor, or justice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the OMB has yet to publish its consolidated 2025 federal AI use case inventory, TechCrunch has reviewed the use cases of several agencies — most of which are either not using Grok or are not disclosing their use of Grok. Aside from the DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services also appears to be actively using Grok, mainly for scheduling and managing social media posts and generating first drafts of documents, briefings, or other communication materials. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Branch pointed to what he sees as a philosophical alignment between Grok and the administration as a reason for overlooking the chatbot’s shortcomings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Grok’s brand is being the ‘anti-woke large language model,’ and that ascribes to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-anti-woke-ai-order-could-reshape-how-us-tech-companies-train-their-models/\">this administration’s philosophy,</a>” Branch said. “If you have an administration that has had multiple <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/stephen-miller-trump-white-house/685516/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">issues with folks</a> who’ve been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/17/thousands-protest-elon-musks-doge-in-nyc-on-presidents-day/\">accused of being Neo Nazis</a> or <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/dhs-white-nationalist-anti-immigrant-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">white supremacists</a>, and then they’re using a large language model that has been tied to that type of behavior, I would imagine they might have a propensity to use it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the coalition’s third letter after writing with similar concerns in <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/news/new-letter-calls-on-omb-to-block-grok-implementation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">August</a> and <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/article/omb-urged-again-to-suspend-federal-use-of-grok-ai-over-accuracy-and-bias-violations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">October</a> last year. In August, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/grok-imagine-xais-new-ai-image-and-video-generator-lets-you-make-nsfw-content/\">xAI launched “spicy mode” </a>in Grok Imagine, triggering mass creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes. TechCrunch also reported in August that private Grok conversations had been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/20/thousands-of-grok-chats-are-now-searchable-on-google/\">indexed by Google Search</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to the October letter, Grok was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/elon-musk-harris-grok-misinformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">providing election misinformation</a>, including false deadlines for ballot changes and political deepfakes. xAI also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/28/elon-musk-grokipedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Grokipedia</a>, which researchers found to be legitimizing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/17/grokipedia-elon-musk-far-right-racist#:~:text='Policies%20preserving%20demographic%20uniformity',commitments%20to%20human%20genetic%20uniformity%E2%80%9D.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">scientific racism</a>, HIV/AIDS skepticism, and vaccine conspiracies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from immediately suspending the federal deployment of Grok, the letter demands that the OMB formally investigate Grok’s safety failures and whether the appropriate oversight processes were conducted for the chatbot. It also asks the agency to publicly clarify whether Grok has been evaluated to comply with President Trump’s executive order requiring LLMs to be truth-seeking and neutral and whether it met OMB’s risk mitigation standards.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The administration needs to take a pause and reassess whether or not Grok meets those thresholds,” Branch said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI and OMB for comment. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But users can always tell when they’re talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq’s customers wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, founded by former Shipt executives <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/RzgMCxo0l0UPwl3oTWuAHyfj3i?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Elliott Potter</a> (CEO), <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/HRluCyp4m4hAk1R5iPC7Hx3Kvf?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Patrick Sullivan</a> (CTO), and <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/9dBxCzq8n8HO91AoCMFpH9dR_D?domain=de7f9591.streaklinks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jared Mattsson</a> (president), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple’s platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images, and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, Potter told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq was not content with its newfound product-market fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called <a href=\"https://poke.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Poke</a>, which can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don’t have a CRM, but we really want to use your API’,” Potter told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poke <a href=\"https://x.com/interaction/status/1965093198482866317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">went viral</a> at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Potter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq’s technology, there’s no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won’t have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don’t need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Linq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers’ AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/dont-trust-averages-how-to-assess-and-strengthen-the-health-of-your-business/\">net revenue retention</a> of 295% with zero churn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple’s platform — at least for now. There’s no telling if Apple will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">pull a Meta</a> and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Potter, however, says Linq’s eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that’s not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That’s just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq’s founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The social network has over 220 million users in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company blamed last week’s snowstorm, which caused an outage at an Oracle-operated data center responsible for TikTok operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have successfully restored TikTok back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather took down a primary U.S. data center site operated by Oracle. The winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues at the site and impacted tens of thousands of servers that help keep TikTok running in the U.S. This affected many of TikTok’s core features—from content posting and discovery to the real-time display of video likes and view counts,” the company said in a post on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, the U.S. finalized the deal to create a separate entity for TikTok. A U.S.-based investor consortium called TikTok USDS took a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/heres-whats-you-should-know-about-the-us-tiktok-deal/\">controlling 80% stake</a>, with the remaining 20% ownership held by ByteDance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Following the deal finalization — which coincided with the snowstorm — users experienced glitches in features <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/\">like posting</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-attributes-recent-glitches-to-a-power-outage-at-a-u-s-data-center/\">searching within the app</a>, slower load times, and time-outs. TikTok noted that creators might see zero views on their posts until the problem was resolved. Later, the company said that it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-says-its-still-working-to-recover-its-u-s-infrastructure/\">was working on solving the issue,</a> but outages persisted, and users faced problems with posting content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok’s transition to a new ownership structure, paired with app snafus and user experience glitches, was beneficial for some other social networks. The Mark Cuban-backed short video app Skylight, which is built on the AT protocol, saw its user base soar to more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-alternative-skylight-soars-to-380k-users-after-tiktok-u-s-deal-finalized/\">380,000 users</a> in the week the deal was finalized. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/upscrolleds-founder-says-the-social-network-has-zoomed-past-2-5m-users/\">UpScrolled</a>, a social network by Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist Issam Hijazi, also climbed in App Store rankings to reach the second spot in the social media category in the U.S. The app was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/social-network-upscrolled-sees-surge-in-downloads-following-tiktoks-us-takeover/\">downloaded 41,000 times</a> within days of the TikTok deal’s finalization, according to analyst firm Appfigures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In addition to splashy features in <a href=\"https://fortune.com/article/tether-ceo-paolo-ardoino-crypto-firm-stabelcoins-howard-lutnick-usdt-cantor-fitzgerald/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fortune</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/tether-is-shaking-up-the-gold-market-with-massive-metal-hoard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino talked with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/tether-ceo-aims-allocate-up-15-its-portfolio-gold-2026-01-28/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters</a>. He also talked with TechCrunch. Why did the man behind the stablecoin that everyone loves to hate launch a full-scale media blitz?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing isn’t arbitrary. This week, Tether launched <a href=\"https://tether.io/news/tether-announces-the-launch-of-usat-the-federally-regulated-dollar-backed-stablecoin-made-in-america/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">USAT</a>, a U.S.-regulated stablecoin issued through Anchorage Digital Bank — its first product designed to comply with new federal rules and compete directly with Circle’s USDC. Fidelity Investments also just launched a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/28/fidelity-enters-crowded-stablecoin-field-with-new-fidd-token/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">competing stablecoin</a> on Wednesday, joining JPMorgan Chase and PayPal in a broadening race.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a big shift from one extreme to the other. For years, Ardoino avoided the United States, watching from offshore as regulators circled and prosecutors investigated. His company was portrayed as opaque, possibly fraudulent, and, according to a piece by The Economist last summer, a “<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2025/07/04/how-tether-became-money-launderers-dream-currency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">money launderer’s dream</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But when Ardoino and I chatted by video call this week, it was clear those days are over. Tether is meeting with White House officials, collaborating with the FBI and Secret Service, and betting USAT can break Circle’s grip on the U.S. market. (USAT is separate from Tether’s flagship USDT, which has $187 billion in circulation globally but doesn’t meet new U.S. regulatory requirements.) Speaking from Lugano, Switzerland, where Tether maintains an office, the 41-year-old — who joined the company just two months after its 2014 launch — spent over an hour describing Tether’s transformation from a crypto play to mainstream acceptance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its momentum is undeniable, certainly. Tether’s USDT — essentially a digital dollar that uses blockchain technology to move across borders without being tied to any single institution — has a market capitalization larger than all of its stablecoin competitors combined. It also has some 536 million users, growing at 30 million per quarter. “It’s growing at a pace more like Facebook rather than any other fintech application,” Ardoino tells me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tether’s first-mover advantage goes beyond market dominance, says Ardoino, describing it as transformative for people in countries with weak currencies. “In Argentina, the peso lost 94.5% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the last five years,” he observes. “In Haiti, the average salary is $1.34 per day. These people were never part of the financial system.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What Tether created is the biggest financial inclusion success story in the history of humanity,” he continues.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ardoino knows he has a lot of work to do to convert more people into believers. It didn’t help when, last summer, The Economist detailed how <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2025/07/04/how-tether-became-money-launderers-dream-currency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Russian money launderer Ekaterina Zhdanova allegedly used Tether</a> to connect British drug gangs, Moscow hackers, sanctioned oligarchs, and Russian intelligence operatives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I bring up that reporting, Ardoino brushes it off, calling the amounts highlighted in the piece “truly a drop in the ocean.” The “infinite, vast majority of the usage of USDT is by good people,” he says, adding that the company now works with almost 300 law enforcement agencies across more than 60 countries. “iPhones are sometimes used by bad people, Toyotas are used by bad people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he goes even further, arguing that his company’s technology makes it superior to cash when it comes to monitoring illicit activity. “If there are cash pallets of hundreds of billions of dollars roaming around the world, U.S. law enforcement can hardly do anything about it,” he says. “But with USDT, we demonstrated that working with the DOJ, FBI, Secret Service, and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies, we could quickly freeze the funds.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fact, according to Ardoino, Tether has frozen $3.5 billion in tokens, the vast majority of which belonged to “people who have been scammed or hacked.” In 2023, he says, for example, Tether proactively identified $225 million in a “pig-butchering scam” in the “blink of an eye” after traditional financial systems failed to catch it. (Pig-butchering scams involve scammers who befriend victims or even romance them over time before luring them into fake investments.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have onboarded the FBI and the Secret Service. We follow OFAC [the office that enforces U.S. sanctions],” he tells me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether critics are satisfied isn’t yet clear, but Tether has survived every attempt to bring it down. It’s an ongoing battle. Just three months ago, the S&amp;P Global Ratings called USDT’s stability <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/tethers-stablecoin-downgraded-weak-sp-assessment-2025-11-26/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">weak</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When raised over our call, Ardoino is dismissive. “If that is the same S&amp;P that completely missed the subprimes, I’m proud they’re considering us weak.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He then points to spring 2022, when another major stablecoin called TerraLuna <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/12/terra-halts-its-blockchain-to-prevent-hacks-ust/\">abruptly collapsed</a>, wiping out $40 billion in value virtually overnight. Panic spread across the stablecoin market, and hedge funds bet Tether would be next to fail. Customers rushed to pull their money out. “We redeemed $7 billion in 48 hours — 10% of our reserves. In 20 days, $20 billion — 25% of our reserves. There is no bank in the world that can survive that level of redemptions. We did it with flying colors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ardoino also references a rival that didn’t fare as well during a separate bank run, though he stops short of naming it. The implication is clear — he means Circle. When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in 2023, Circle’s USDC briefly lost its peg after revealing $3 billion in exposure. When I ask Ardoino directly about Circle — often portrayed as the cleaner alternative — his PR team quickly interjects. He manages only: “Sometimes you are painted in a different light if you don’t bend the knee to Wall Street.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ardoino emphasizes that Tether now has $30 billion in excess reserves beyond what’s needed to redeem all outstanding tokens. What’s more, those reserves are held at Cantor Fitzgerald — the Wall Street firm that Howard Lutnick led for over three decades before becoming U.S. Commerce Secretary a year ago. Lutnick has publicly vouched for Tether’s legitimacy; meanwhile the firm earns fees from managing Tether’s massive Treasury holdings, creating a financial interest that now exists alongside Lutnick’s role shaping America’s commerce policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tether is now safer than traditional banks, is Ardoino’s point. “The banking system is doing fractional reserve at the length of 90%,” Ardoino says. “So if you deposit $1 million in a bank account, $100,000 is there, and $900,000 is lent out.” By contrast, he argued, “even if Bitcoin would go to zero, Tether would have more money than all the USDT tokens issued.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All those reserves generate enormous profits. According to Fortune, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/27/tether-15-billion-profit-lceo-strong-case-finance-leaders-embrace-stablecoins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tether reported more than $15 billion in profit for 2025</a> derived largely from yield on reserves that — unlike with savings or checking accounts — it doesn’t share with USDT holders. When I ask whether Tether would reconsider sharing interest with its customers, Ardoino says that while interest makes sense for Americans who’ve come to expect it, it’s not top of mind for Tether’s core users, who are primarily trying to preserve value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Turkish Lira lost 81% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the last five years. The Argentina peso lost 94.5%,” he says. For someone whose currency loses 3% daily, a 4% annual interest rate is meaningless. “While for the rest of the world, U.S. dollar stablecoins are the savings account, you cannot think about stablecoins for U.S. people as the savings account, but more like a checking account.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There may be another reason Tether isn’t eager to share yields: Pending legislation could make it illegal anyway. <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3633/text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The CLARITY Act</a>, currently moving through Congress, would prohibit stablecoin issuers from paying interest to holders, a move that banking groups support to prevent deposits from fleeing traditional banks. For Tether, its passage would simply codify its existing business model. For competitors like Circle, which have experimented with reward programs, it could eliminate a competitive tool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Beyond stablecoins</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ardoino’s ambitions extend far beyond USDT. Tether Gold, a token backed by physical gold that launched in 2020, now has $2.6 billion in circulation, meaning customers hold tokens representing that much gold. But Tether’s total gold strategy is far more ambitious. According to Ardoino’s Bloomberg interview, the company holds around 140 tons of gold worth roughly $24 billion, making it one of the largest private gold holders in the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why Tether launched products like Tether Gold, he frames it as offering alternatives in an uncertain world. “Gold has been the first big, almost ubiquitous form of currency in humanity,” he says. “For the first time, with blockchain technology, we could actually make gold again a currency used not only as a store of value, but also a way to exchange value.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the gold product launched, “we were almost called crazy,” he recalls. Since then, Tether has been buying a whopping one to two tons per week, positioning itself as what Ardoino calls “one of the biggest gold central banks in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s the company’s push into AI that hints at Ardoino’s even grander plans. Roughly nine months ago, Tether rolled out <a href=\"https://qvac.tether.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Qvac</a>, Tether’s decentralized AI platform. The name comes from Isaac Asimov’s short story “The Last Question,” which Ardoino sees as the “most magnificent sci-fi piece of literature ever written.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His pitch for Qvac echoes his pitch for USDT, which is to serve the underserved. “USDT never meant to go after people that had an account in JPMorgan,” he explains. “We went to all the people left behind by the traditional financial system.” Similarly, centralized AI platforms will miss billions of people who can’t afford subscriptions, he says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If they don’t have enough money for paying $150 per year for a bank account, they don’t have enough money to be onboarded on powerful AI platforms,” Ardoino says. Instead, Qvac will run locally on smartphones, as he believes within three to five years, today’s most powerful smartphones will be commonplace in Africa and South America, enabling up to 80% of AI use cases. “So USDT will empower the biggest decentralized AI platform in the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s quite a vision, yet even Qvac is just another prong of a bigger strategy. According to Fortune, Tether has committed more than $1 billion to German AI robotics firm Neura, $775 million to social media platform Rumble, and hundreds of millions more to satellites, data centers, and agriculture. The magazine described Tether’s transformation into something resembling a sovereign wealth fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I note that from the outside, these investments — including a stake in the Juventus Football Club — seem disconnected, Ardoino insists they are not. “The motto of Tether is to be the stable company,” he says. “The reason why we invest in land, cattle, agriculture, modern tech, in gold — the common denominator is ensuring that Tether can remain a cornerstone of the world that is our user.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He describes it as an interlocking system where agriculture can be digitalized, gold markets revolutionized, telecommunications made peer-to-peer. “Our story is about building a company that can [stand] the test of time,” he says. “It’s becoming a social impact company that is changing the lives of hundreds of millions of people and providing them something they never had before — stability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And when I bring up political risks — what happens if the next U.S. administration views Tether as a threat, as did the last — Ardoino is ready for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I hope that financial inclusion and bringing 536 million people on board onto the dollar is something that both Republicans and Democrats care about,” he says.  “It’s a matter of education.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Ardoino is joining us at TechCrunch Disrupt, happening in San Francisco October 13-15. Don’t miss out on what’s sure to be the year’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2026/\">strongest industry event</a>.</em> </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

So even though the documentary is outperforming pre-release estimates predicting a $3 to $5 million opening weekend, it’s unlikely to make a profit in theaters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s bid came in $26 million ahead of the next highest bidder, Disney, leading critics to suggest the deal had less to do with the film’s box office potential and more with winning over the Trump administration. Veteran film executive Ted Hope, who worked at Amazon from 2015 to 2020, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/media/amazon-melania-trump-film-critics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told The New York Times</a> that the film “has to be the most expensive documentary ever made that didn’t involve music licensing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How can it not be equated with currying favor or an outright bribe?” Hope said. “How can that not be the case?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the first film directed by Brett Ratner since 2017, when <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-brett-ratner-allegations-20171101-htmlstory.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">multiple women accused him of sexual harassment and misconduct.</a> (Ratner has denied those accusations.)

The documentary currently <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/melania/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sits at 7% on review aggregator Metacritic</a>, indicating “overwhelming dislike,” and <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/melania\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">at 10% on Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New York Times film critic <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/movies/melania-trump-movie-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Manohla Dargis described it</a> as “a very circumscribed and carefully stage-managed chronicle of Mrs. Trump’s day-to-day life” during the 20 days before President Trump’s 2025 inauguration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement, Amazon MGM’s head of domestic theatrical distribution Kevin Wilson described this weekend as “an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series,” which he predicted will have a “significant life” on Amazon’s Prime streaming service.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
