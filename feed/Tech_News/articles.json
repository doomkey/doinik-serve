The update represents the first major Fire TV release in years from a user experience perspective, the company says, and is accompanied by a refreshed version of the Fire TV app and the arrival of new premium Fire TV televisions with colorful frames.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company saw the need for a change to the Fire TV’s look and feel as the amount of streaming content has exploded over the years. Fire TV customers today can access TV and movies via purchases, rentals, and streaming services, but also have apps for viewing short-form content on the TV, access to numerous live TV streams, premium content, podcasts, music, games, and more.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fire-tv-s-simpler-design\">Fire TV’s simpler design</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we brought that content forward, the [user interface] got a little cluttered — a lot of stuff and a lot of rows,” explained Fire TV VP Aidan Marcuss in an interview with TechCrunch. “We know the data — there’s a lot of time spent searching,” he added. “We…know that it could just be easier.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new user interface features several design changes, including rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content to make the interface feel less cluttered. While you can still scroll down to see your favorite rows, like what’s up next, you can also see your apps in an expanded horizontal row.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079585\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png 2375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=1200,773 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=1280,825 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=430,277 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=720,464 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=900,580 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=800,515 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=1536,990 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=2048,1319 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=668,430 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=582,375 582w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=958,617 958w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=708,456 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before, you could only <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00008BsKbqSAF/new-interface\">pin six apps</a> to the Fire TV’s home screen — a common user complaint. But the update has reduced the app icons’ size, allowing more to be visible on the home screen, and offers you 20 app slots you can scroll through.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the top of the screen, navigation has been simplified into obvious categories like Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. A search button is available to the left of the Home tab.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079583\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6-New-Fire-TV-UI-Browse-Screen.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across the new tabs, Fire TV centralizes access to the content you’re already watching, and what’s available across services you’re subscribed to. It also offers you the ability to discover new content, including recommended movies or shows (in rows labeled “For You”), free movies you can stream, lists of the top movies or shows, and other subscription content you may want to try. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These pages don’t offer infinite scrolling, but they’re lengthy as they represent the depth of content available on streaming services.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079580\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4-New-Fire-TV-UI-Sports-Screen.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new live TV tab organizes the live content from the services that have live TV streams built into them, plus broadcast or cable TV, if you happen to subscribe. The sports section, more specifically, includes access to the live games that are on now and other scheduled sports content. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other TV features are tucked away under the three-line hamburger menu icon, like Games, Art &amp; Photos, the Appstore, Music Video &amp; Audio, a now-universal watchlist (“My Stuff”), Settings, and other options.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make it easier to access commonly used settings, you can also now long-press on the Home button to adjust settings for the display and audio, set a sleep timer, use accessibility features, access smart home features, and more. From this panel, you can do things like adjust the TV brightness, boost the audio dialogue, or display your Ring camera’s feed on screen while you watch, among other things.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079582\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5-New-Fire-TV-UI-Games-Screen.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The redesign also includes rewritten code that makes the interface move faster on some devices, Amazon claims.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On our most popular devices, this is 20% to 30% faster for the same functions, because it’s all about getting people to what they want to watch, fast,” notes Marcuss.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-comes-built-in\">AI comes built in</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, Alexa+ access is built in, allowing users to ask questions, find content, or even do things like call an Uber. This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show’s square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content.

On Monday, at the start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s own Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Related to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a backseat.) </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?w=335\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079554\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=768,1560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=591,1200 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=630,1280 630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=212,430 212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=354,720 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=443,900 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=394,800 394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=756,1536 756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=1008,2048 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=329,668 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=185,375 185w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=304,617 304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=261,531 261w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot of the new Alexa app</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks, for instance exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, but it also means doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More recently, Amazon has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/amazons-ai-assistant-alexa-now-works-with-angi-expedia-square-and-yelp/\">integrating more services with Alexa+</a>, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079552\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1200,750 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1280,800 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=430,269 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=720,450 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=900,563 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=800,500 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=668,418 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=600,375 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=987,617 987w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=708,443 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079551\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1200,750 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1280,800 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=430,269 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=720,450 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=900,563 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=800,500 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=668,418 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=600,375 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=987,617 987w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=708,443 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/amazon-unveils-a-new-and-improved-alexa-alexa/\">its debut of Alexa+ early last year.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rausch tells us that over 10 million consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy smart home customers also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are over-represented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Designed for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079567\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079571\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments.

They’re asking the court for permission to instead serve Russell by mail or email. A lawyer for Luminar declined to comment further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In emails attached to the filing, Russell claimed he was being cooperative and has been trying to get assurances from Luminar that any personal data from his devices will be protected. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The company declined, so we will follow the court-established process for data handling protections instead,” Leonard Shulman, an attorney for Russell, told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The emergency filing is one of the first major twists in a fast-moving bankruptcy case that involves Luminar trying to sell the two main parts of its business. The company is seeking court approval of an already-reached agreement to sell its semiconductor subsidiary <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to a company called Quantum Computing, Inc.</a>, and has established a January 9 deadline for bids on its lidar division. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy Luminar before the Chapter 11 filing and has expressed plans to make a bid in the bankruptcy process. “As it relates to Luminar, our focus remains on what matters: Russell AI Labs’ bid to rebuild the company and bring value to its stakeholders,” Shulman said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for Luminar said in the filing that it began hunting for information from Russell in May, just after he abruptly resigned following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” performed by the board’s audit committee. The company was evaluating whether it may have potential legal claims against him “relating to the Audit Committee inquiry and personal loans taken by Mr. Russell,” according to the filing. But Luminar said those efforts were unsuccessful and Russell was not cooperative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On November 12, Luminar’s board of directors established a Special Investigation Committee and hired law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges to further investigate “certain acts, omissions, transactions and potential claims and causes of action involving or related to certain current and former directors and officers of Luminar.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One month later, just before the bankruptcy, lawyers for Weil contacted the law firm of McDermott Will &amp; Schulte, which had previously represented Russell. The Weil lawyers asked about collecting Russell’s Luminar-provided laptop and desktop computers, along with his company-issued phone and a digital copy (or “image”) of his personal phone. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawyers from Weil spent a week trying to confirm whether McDermott would represent Russell in the matter of the Special Investigation Committee, only to find out on December 19 that it would not. The Weil lawyers tried contacting Russell directly instead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell responded for the first time on Christmas Eve, according to the filing. He eventually authorized McDermott to turn over the computers (which the firm had kept in its possession since his resignation), but the founder repeatedly asked for guarantees that Luminar’s lawyers would not search through personal data on his phones, emails attached to the emergency filing show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have offered direct cooperation as well as prompt action, even through the holidays – but if this singular basic protection cannot be confirmed, I am advised further deliberations on this matter will not be productive,” Russell wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Representatives for Luminar arranged to have a forensic examiner appear at Russell’s mansion in Florida on New Year’s Day. But the technician was turned away by Russell’s security team, which a lawyer for Luminar called “unacceptable.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Russell claimed the technician was sent to his home “unannounced” on the holiday morning “when I was asleep,” and reiterated his desire to protect the privacy of his personal data. A lawyer for Luminar responded that they had “repeatedly confirmed that we have no intention of looking at any documents beyond those that are Luminar-related.” Russell replied on January 2 that “[a]ny characterization that I have been uncooperative is wholly inaccurate” and accused the lawyers of “word gymnastics.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar’s lawyers tried instead to subpoena this information from Russell but claim their process servers were similarly turned away by his security team. They also claim those security team members lied about Russell’s presence at his Florida residence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Can we try to serve Austin again today? We’re going to need someone dogged. He is going to evade service as long as possible,” one of the Weil lawyers wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve. “In fact, he was home when your person tried last time and the guard simply lied for him.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company is positioning the sensor, called Summit, as the first long-range, high-resolution sensor of its kind “designed for high performance in any type of weather, filling a critical gap left by legacy radar and lidar sensors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sensor will start shipping until 2028 if Teradar can lock down contracts with automakers. If that happens, the company expects the Summit will help enable those companies to add partial, or even full, autonomy features to their vehicles. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teradar’s whole approach is about leveraging the relatively-unused terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared. And it’s a solid-state sensor, meaning there are no moving parts. All this is meant to give Teradar’s sensor the best qualities of lidar and radar sensors, with few of the drawbacks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a potentially attractive proposition for automakers who might wince at the cost of lidars or the limitations of radars. Teradar says it’s already working to prove its tech with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe, and three Tier 1 suppliers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teradar’s impending entry into the market comes at a pivotal moment for automotive sensor suppliers. Leading U.S. lidar company Luminar just filed for bankruptcy protection in December after contracts with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz fell apart, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as the automakers backed away from the tech</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those deals also crumbled partly because of low-cost competition from China, according to Luminar. Lidar adoption has been strong in China’s auto market and shows little sign of slowing up. In October, Chinese lidar company Hesai said it had built more than 1 million lidar sensors in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other U.S. companies in the space, like Ouster (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/14/ouster-velodyne-merger-lidar-smart-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired and merged with rival Velodyne</a> after a wave of consolidation) have diversified into potential markets like robotics and smart infrastructure.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teradar is looking beyond automotive, too, and that vision was reflected in its recent raise. The $150 million Series B included funding from Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, and VXI Capital, a <a href=\"https://www.venturecapitaljournal.com/defense-tech-expert-collects-50m-for-new-venture-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new defense-focused fund</a> led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lidar isn’t completely dead in the auto industry, however. Rivian in December said it would integrate a roof-mounted lidar sensor (from an unnamed supplier) in its upcoming R2 SUV, signaling that there is still an appetite for using advanced sensor technology to bring autonomy to passenger vehicles, especially if it’s affordable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teradar CEO Matt Carey told TechCrunch in November that he believes his terahertz sensor can meet all those marks, and sounded eager to pounce on the opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our main job is to make sure our sensor gets on all automobiles, and whatever the best way to do that is, that’s what we’re going to pursue,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In January 2025, Kodiak’s self-driving trucks began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/kodiak-has-made-its-first-driverless-truck-deliveries-to-customer-atlas-energy/\">making driverless deliveries</a> for Atlas Energy Solutions in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kodiak has since delivered at least eight self-driving trucks to Atlas Energy as part of an initial 100-truck order under an agreement between the two companies. Kodiak has been working with Roush Industries, which was the upfitter for its driverless trucks delivered to Atlas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company, which went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II in September 2025, wants to scale its tech for the truck masses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bosch and Kodiak will work together on redundant platforms designed to turn semi trucks — regardless of manufacturer — into driverless ones. Bosch will supply Kodiak with a variety of hardware components, including sensors and vehicle actuation components such as steering technologies. Notably, these systems can be added within the vehicle production line or by a third-party upfitter at a later date, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe collaborating with Bosch will allow us to scale autonomous driving hardware with the modularity, serviceability, and system-level integration needed for commercial success for both upfit and factory-line integration,” Burnette said in a statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paul Thomas, who is president of Bosch in North America and the company’s Bosch Mobility Americas division, appears to see this as opportunity for growth in the sector. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By supplying production-grade hardware, we are enabling the next generation of autonomous trucking alongside Kodiak,” said Thomas in a statement. “Kodiak has already deployed trucks with no humans on board in commercial operation and this cooperation gives us a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding of real-world autonomous vehicle requirements and to further enhance our offerings for the broader autonomous mobility ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Kodiak’s plan is to scale and Bosch is keen to increase its market share in the sector, it’s unclear exactly when this will happen. Neither company provided a timeline for when these new systems might go into production or become available.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Flutterwave operates one of the continent’s widest payments networks, while Mono, often described as the “Plaid for Africa,” has built APIs that allow businesses to access bank data, initiate payments, and verify customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mono has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/439400-89/company/profile#investors\">raised about $17.5 million</a> from investors, including Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and Target Global. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers seeing paper returns of up to 20x based on the implied valuation of the stock they received from Flutterwave. Mono will continue to operate as an independent product, the companies said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers seeing paper returns of up to 20x based on the implied valuation of the stock they received.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2020, Mono, like Plaid, uses APIs that allow users to consent to sharing their bank information, enabling financial institutions to analyze income, spending patterns, and repayment capacity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/\">addresses the lack of standardized access to bank data across African markets</a>, where credit bureaus remain limited and fintechs, especially lenders, often rely on customers’ bank transaction histories to assess creditworthiness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to CEO <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ijbkid/\">Abdulhamid Hassan</a>, nearly all Nigerian digital lenders now rely on Mono’s infrastructure. The company claims to have powered more than 8 million bank account linkages, covering roughly 12% of Nigeria’s banked population. It also claims to have delivered 100 billion financial data points to lending companies and processed millions in direct bank payments. Customers include Visa-backed Moniepoint and GIC-backed PalmPay.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Flutterwave, which powers local and cross-border payments across more than 30 African countries, the deal deepens its vertical integration. In addition to payments, the company can now offer onboarding and identity checks, bank account verification, data-driven risk assessment, and one-time or recurring bank payments within a single stack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flutterwave CEO <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gbagboola\">Olugbenga ‘GB’ Agboola</a> framed the acquisition as a bet on Africa’s next phase of fintech growth. “Payments, data, and trust cannot exist in silos,” he said. “Open banking provides the connective tissue, and Mono has built critical infrastructure in this space.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hassan echoed that view, arguing that Africa is entering a credit-driven phase as governments across the continent push lending-led financial inclusion initiatives. That transition depends on both substantial data infrastructure and regulatory confidence, particularly in markets like Nigeria, where open banking frameworks are still evolving.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If the economy is going to be credit-driven, you need deep data intelligence to know how people earn and spend,” Hassan said. “But at the same time, for open banking to really work, regulators need to be confident that customer funds are safe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Against that backdrop, joining Flutterwave positions Mono to scale quickly once regulatory barriers fall. Flutterwave already operates across dozens of African markets, with local licenses, enterprise customers, and compliance teams in place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This allows us to expand what’s possible for businesses operating across African markets while staying grounded in security, compliance, and local relevance,” Agboola said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The transaction mirrors earlier consolidation attempts in global fintech infrastructure, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/\">Visa’s failed acquisition of Plaid in 2020</a>, which was blocked by U.S. regulators. Hassan cited that deal as evidence that combining data infrastructure with payment rails can unlock scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both Y Combinator-backed companies count Tiger Global (which was the lead investor in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/16/african-fintech-flutterwave-triples-valuation-to-over-3b-after-250m-series-d/\">Flutterwave’s Series C</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/\">Mono’s Series A</a>) among their backers. Hassan said, however, that the firm did not facilitate the transaction. Instead, the deal grew out of a longstanding working relationship between the two companies, which had partnered on several bank payment products over the years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That collaboration played out against an open banking landscape that has changed significantly over the past five years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Mono launched, it faced competition from companies such as Base10 Partners-backed Okra and Ribbit Capital-backed Stitch. Since then, Mono has emerged as a leading player in the space, following <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techpoint.africa/insight/okra-return-funds-investors/\">Okra’s shutdown</a> and Stitch’s pivot toward a deeper payments ecosystem play that has allowed it to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.stitch.money/blog/stitch-announces-55-million-series-b-funding-round\">raise significantly more capital</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Addressing Mono’s financial position ahead of the acquisition, Hassan said the company, which, according to Pitchbook, raised <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/439400-89/company/profile#deal-history\">$15 million in Series A at a $50 million post-money valuation</a> in 2021, was not forced into a sale to Flutterwave and is on track toward profitability this year. With significant cash reserves, he added, raising another round would have introduced new valuation and growth expectations in a tough funding environment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, beyond the two companies involved, the transaction — similar to the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rmb.co.za/news/rmb-supports-lesaka-in-acquisition-of-adumo-group\">consolidation between South African fintechs Lesaka and Adumo</a> — signals a broader inflection point for African fintech, where startups that once aspired to become standalone giants may increasingly find better outcomes by integrating into scaled platforms.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But he noted, “Someone chimed in downthread to say that the same thing happened to him, also in Austin, with the same driver display name.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for how the driver pulled it off, Hobart speculated they used a hacked account on a jailbroken phone, obtaining an image of his front door through a DoorDash feature that shows photos from prior deliveries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A DoorDash spokesperson told TechCrunch, “After quickly investigating this incident, our team permanently removed the Dasher’s account and ensured the customer was made whole. We have zero tolerance for fraud and use a combination of technology and human review to detect and prevent bad actors from abusing our platform.”</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The new pin brings a physical button that lets you start and stop the recording. Plus, during the recording, you can tap the button to highlight a certain point — just like you can do on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/plaud-launches-a-new-ai-hardware-notetaker-the-179-note-pro/\">the newly launched Plaud Note Pro</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One nice thing about the $179 Plaud NotePin S is that you get a clip, a lanyard, a magnetic pin, and a wristband in the package. That means you can wear the device however you like. The company is also adding Apple Find My support for the pin, so that you can easily look for the device if you can’t find it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The core specifications of the device remain the same from the previous generation. There is 64GB of onboard storage with a battery capacity of 20 hours of continuous recording. The device has two MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mics that can capture clear audio within 9.8 feet of range. Users will get 300 minutes of transcription per month for free and</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As compared to the Note Pro, this device has a shorter recording range and lower battery life. But it is smaller in size to carry using any of the above mentioned accesories. The company said that the pin is suited for people who are constantly on the go.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079510\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Plaud-Desktop-KV.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Plaud</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is Plaud’s fourth device, and the company has sold more than 1.5 million devices until now. With these devices, the focus has been on in-person meetings. However, Plaud also wants to take on meeting notetakers like Granola, Fathom, and Fireflies with a new desktop client that works across meeting apps. The company said that the app can detect when a meeting is active and prompt you to capture the transcript.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Mac app takes notes using system audio to capture the meeting, and then structures the transcription into notes using AI. The company introduced multimodal inputs for notetaking with its app that allows users to add images and typed notes along with audio transcription last year. Plaud is bringing that functionality to its desktop app as well. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The buds cost $199 and will come with a year-long subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a custom chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also trying to compete with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/the-best-ai-powered-dictation-apps-of-2025/\">AI-powered voice dictation apps</a> such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monolouge, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that the buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI’s transcription model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle’s co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was whispering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-a-ring-to-take-voice-notes-and-control-music/\">Sandbar</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/\">Pebble</a> announced forthcoming rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with the app, it wants to provide the functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can pre-order these buds using <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://subtle.co\">the startup’s site</a>.

The Delete Act, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-09-14/california-bill-delete-online-personal-data\">passed in 2023</a>, was supposed to simplify things, allowing residents to make a single request that more than 500 registered data brokers delete their information.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://privacy.ca.gov/drop/\">Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform</a> (DROP) actually gives residents the ability to make that request. Once DROP users verify that they are California residents, they can submit a deletion request that will go to all current and future data brokers registered with the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that doesn’t necessarily mean that all your data will be deleted immediately. Brokers are supposed to start processing requests in August 2026, then they have 90 days to actually process requests and report back. If they don’t delete your data, you’ll have the option to submit additional information that may help them locate your records.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies will also be able to keep first-party data that they’ve collected from users. It’s only brokers who seek to buy or sell that data — which can include your social security number, browsing history, email address, phone number, and more — who will be required to delete it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some information, such as vehicle registration and voter records, is exempt from deletion because it comes from public documents. Other data, such as sensitive medical information, may be covered under other laws like HIPAA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The California Privacy Protection Agency says that in addition to giving residents more control over their data, the tool could result in fewer “unwanted texts, calls, or emails” and also decrease the “risk of identity theft, fraud, AI impersonations, or that your data is leaked or hacked.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The penalty for data brokers who fail to register or fail to delete requested consumer data is $200 per day, plus enforcement costs, according to the agency.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections — legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals — primarily women — to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a <a href=\"https://x.com/priyankac19/status/2006979351217324527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">formal complaint</a> from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-02/grok-posts-sexual-images-of-minors-after-lapses-in-safeguards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">generated sexualized images involving minors</a>, an issue X <a href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/2007006470689214749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acknowledged</a> earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India’s IT and criminal laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government said noncompliance could lead to action against X under India’s IT law and criminal statutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, one of the world’s biggest digital markets, has emerged as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to go in holding platforms responsible for AI-generated content. Any tightening of enforcement in the country could have ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/x-says-will-fight-indian-court-ruling-on-content-takedown-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">content regulation rules in court</a>, arguing that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even as the platform has complied with a majority of blocking directives. At the same time, Grok has been increasingly used by X users for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/x-users-treating-grok-like-a-fact-checker-spark-concerns-over-misinformation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">real-time fact-checking</a> and commentary on news events, making its outputs more visible — and more politically sensitive — than those of stand-alone AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Indian government’s order.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered “other models,” a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China’s BYD, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-01/byd-sells-4-6-million-vehicles-in-2025-meets-revised-sales-goal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">delivered 2.26 million EVs</a> in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States — although notably not from Chinese automakers, which are barred from selling vehicles in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/tesla-has-its-best-sales-quarter-of-2025-as-ev-tax-credit-expires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">record-breaking</a> 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter — a 29% increase from the previous quarter — as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and toward AI and robotics. Musk’s pitch is there is money to be made in “sustainable abundance,” a catchphrase used throughout the company’s recent <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/master-plan-part-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Master Plan IV</a> that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage, and robotics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And yet, the bulk of Tesla’s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
