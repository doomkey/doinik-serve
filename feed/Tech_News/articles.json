However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://Founded%20less%20than%20two%20years%20ago,%20the%20startup%20is%20led%20by%20former%20Splunk%20executive%20Spiros%20Xanthos%20and%20Mayank%20Agarwal,%20Splunk%E2%80%99s%20former%20chief%20architect%20for%20observability.%20The%20duo%E2%80%99s%20partnership%20dates%20back%2020%20years%20to%20their%20graduate%20studies%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Illinois%20Urbana-Champaign.%20This%20isn't%20their%20first%20collaboration;%20they%20previously%20co-founded%20Omnition,%20a%20startup%20that%20was%20acquired%20by%20Splunk%20in%202019.\">become popular</a> for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last October, Resolve AI raised a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/greylock-backed-resolve-ai-raises-35-million-seed-funding-help-engineers-2024-10-01/\">$35 million seed</a> round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/06/18/traversal-emerges-from-stealth-with-48-million-from-sequoia-and-kleiner-perkins-to-reimagine-site-reliability-in-the-ai-era/\">a $48 million Series A</a> led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rivian plans to start selling its more affordable R2 SUV in the first half of 2026. The upcoming R2 is supposed to reach a much wider market than the company’s current R1 SUV and pickup truck and the EV maker has plans to make hundreds of thousands of them per year, including at a new factory in Georgia. Rivian is also looking to expand its automated driving features next year, which it detailed at last week’s inaugural <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/inside-rivians-big-et-on-ai-powered-self-driving/\">Autonomy &amp; AI Day event</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marcario has served on Rivian’s board since January 2021, a role she took after 12 years as an executive (and eventual CEO) of Patagonia. Before her appointment, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe often <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/amazon-invests-rivian-electric-truck-suv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described</a> his aim for the company to become “the Patagonia of EVs.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian said Friday that Marcario will continue her role as chair of the board of trustees overseeing the Rivian Foundation. She serves on that board alongside Scaringe, Rivian’s chief sustainability officer Anisa Kamadoli Costa, and conservationist Ed M. Norton.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Formed just before the company’s blockbuster 2021 IPO, the Rivian Foundation was initially handed 1% of the company’s equity in order to make “the natural world” a “stakeholder in [Rivian’s] success.” The foundation remained quiet for the first few years as Rivian’s stock price fell from its post-IPO highs, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/rivian-foundation-reveals-first-10-million-grantees/\">announced its first $10 million in grants in 2024</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, the Rivian Foundation <a href=\"https://rivianfoundation.org/what-we-fund#our-grantees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has publicized</a> another $2.6 million in awards on its website.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We would like to thank her for her stewardship on the Rivian board over the past 5 years, and look forward to her continued leadership on the Rivian Foundation,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The environment is moving fast, Achadjian told the crowd, and companies are experiencing unprecedented growth.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We spend an enormous, enormous amount of time really assessing the entrepreneur and how resilient they will be able to be in a moment where things are just rapidly changing,” Achadjian said. Now more than ever, founders have to lean into showing their passion and domain expertise, and remain honest about their product market fit, she said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is so much demand from enterprise companies to try the latest and greatest AI, sometimes there’s false positives of product market fit,” she explained, “and you can get a lot of revenue with not having true ROI,” meaning customers who are getting their return on investment.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That leads another consideration VCs are looking for: an ability to pivot as the market twists and turns. “There’s a joke that, like, 1,000 startups die and that’s why being resilient is really important,” Achadjian continued.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deng, who used to work at OpenAI, added to Achadjian’s statements. He said founders need to find their unique data flywheels that are going to separate them from the hordes of everyone pitching the exact same idea, especially since the enterprise companies likely testing their products are also testing out a few other competitors at the same time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re able to go deep and really solve a true need for them,” in a way they cannot do themselves, then managing data is “where the important part is,” he said.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founders should also have an answer for why their product will not just be a feature added into the foundational models, Achadjian said. It may be okay if a founder doesn’t know if the model makers are working on a competor but they should have a hypothesis on how the business is defensible when pitching investors.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, what’s working in AI seems to be three things, Chen noted: Chat apps, coding apps, and AI in customer service. But there is still so much more change to happen throughout every sector and industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deng is excited by AI-enabled marketplaces. Achadjian, meanwhile, thinks that this could be the moment for robotics, while Chen is curious to see how AI impacts SaaS and othermarkets not yet directly impacted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for what’s not AI and exciting? “Pen and paper processes and digitize them,” Achadjian said. There’s a lot of blue-collar industries that, incredibly, still do many processes manually, she continued. But, they acknowledged even that is ripe for the opportunity to be automated by AI. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Musk and Tesla hit all of those goals, but not before a shareholder filed suit over the award in 2018, arguing that it had been improperly negotiated and that shareholders weren’t properly informed of the conflicts of interest at play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk and the many Tesla supporters decried the lawsuit as absurd, particularly the fact that the plaintiff — a former corporate defense lawyer and heavy metal drummer named Richard Tornetta — only <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/elon-musk-bashed-by-heavy-metal-drummer-who-cost-him-56-bln-2024-02-01/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">owned nine shares of company stock</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After years of back-and-forth, including a trial where Musk testified, the Chancery Court judge overseeing the case agreed with the plaintiff and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/30/elon-musks-56b-tesla-pay-deal-is-unfair-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">initially struck down the pay package in January 2024</a>.

But it’s been embroiled in controversy for most of its existence.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anonymous messaging apps are problematic because they can encourage bullying among teens — Snapchat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/17/following-suicides-and-lawsuits-snapchat-restricts-apps-building-on-its-platform-with-new-policies/\">banned</a> third-party apps like NGL, LMK, Sendit, and YOLO from its platform in 2022 after a parent sued the company for its alleged role in her teenage son’s suicide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NGL also came under fire for its shady growth hacking tactics, like sending fake messages to users that seemed like they were from real people but were actually automated by the app. Some users were tricked into paying a $9.99 monthly subscription to get hints about who sent the messages, which were fake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a two-year investigation, the FTC <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/09/ftc-bans-ngl-from-offering-its-anonymous-social-app-to-minors/\">announced</a> in 2024 that it would ban NGL from offering its app to minors — one of its most drastic interventions to protect minors from harmful social media experiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“NGL’s bait-and-switch tactic prompted many consumers to complain, which NGL executives laughed off, dismissing such users as ‘suckers’,” the FTC said in a statement at the time. NGL paid a $5 million fine to the FTC and complied with its demands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NGL’s two founders, Raj Vir and João Figueiredo, are moving on from the app, according to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anonymous-messaging-app-ngl-has-been-acquired-by-mode-mobile-2025-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Business Insider</a>.

Now, security researchers say there are hundreds of Cisco customers who could potentially be hacked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Piotr Kijewski, the chief executive of the nonprofit Shadowserver Foundation that scans and monitors the internet for hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that the scale of exposure “seems more in the hundreds rather than thousands or tens of thousands.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kijewski said the foundation was not seeing widespread activity, presumably because “current attacks are targeted.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"http://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/tree/?date_range=1&amp;source=http_vulnerable&amp;source=http_vulnerable6&amp;tag=cve-2025-20393%2B&amp;data_set=count&amp;scale=log&amp;auto_update=on\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shadowserver has a page</a> where it’s tracking the number of systems that are exposed and vulnerable to the flaw disclosed by Cisco, named officially as CVE-2025-20393. The vulnerability is known as a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day</a>, because the flaw was discovered before the company had time to make patches available. As of press time, India, Thailand, and the United States collectively have dozens of affected systems within their borders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Censys, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacking activities across the internet, is also seeing a limited number of affected Cisco customers. <a href=\"https://censys.com/advisory/cve-2025-20393\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">According to a blog post</a>, Censys has observed 220 internet-exposed Cisco email gateways, one of the products known to be vulnerable.  </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this hacking campaign?

Neither of those two conditions are enabled by default, per Cisco, which would explain why there appears to be, relatively speaking, not that many vulnerable systems on the internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cisco did not respond to a request for comment, asking if the company could corroborate the numbers seen by Shadowserver and Censys. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger problem with this hacking campaign is that there are no patches available.

Nabla disclosed LeBrun’s new job in a <a href=\"https://www.nabla.com/press-release/nabla-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-advanced-machine-intelligence-to-pioneer-the-next-era-of-agentic-healthcare-ai#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a> and LeCun confirmed it in a brief post on LinkedIn.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Yes, AMI Labs is my new startup. I’m the Executive Chairman. And Alex LeBrun is transitioning from CEO of Nabla to CEO of AMI Labs!” LeCun <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7407558824187867136/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AMI Labs is also reportedly seeking to raise €500 million (about $586 million) at a €3 billion valuation (about $3.5 billion) right out of the gate, before even launching, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d88729c0-c44f-4530-b888-bafa29ee0446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Financial Times reported</a>, citing people familiar with the dealmaking. Given the kind of money that VCs are throwing at AI startups founded by world-recognized AI scientists these days, that’s not even an comparatively outrageous ask.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was valued at $12 billion for its seed round</a> last year. And Murati doesn’t have the same kind of street cred as LeCun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeCun, a professor at New York University who was formerly VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta, <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lecun_6017366.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">won the prestigious A.M. Turing Award</a>, for his work on reinforcement learning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The press release also confirms what everyone knew as well: that AMI Labs is working on world model AI. This is an alternative to LLMs where the AI attempts to understand its environment (aka the world) so it can simulate cause-and-effect and what-if scenarios to predict outcomes. World model creators believe it’s the answer to LLMs’ structural hallucination problems. LLMs can’t be trusted to never fabricate info because it is their very nature to be “non-deterministic” — that is, creative.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Top labs and startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/deepmind-thinks-genie-3-world-model-presents-stepping-stone-towards-agi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google DeepMind</a> and Fei-Fei Li’s startup, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">World Labs</a>, are also developing world models. By that comparison, the fundraising aspirations of AMI might appear a bit more audacious. When World Labs debuted, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-comes-out-of-stealth-with-230m-in-funding/\">Li raised $230 million at a $1 billion valuation</a> right out of the gate, which was considered a lot at the time. But that was way back in August 2024, or about 100 AI years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Nabla says the company will be searching for a new CEO and will be, for now, run by its co-founder and COO, Delphine Groll, who has not been handed the reins permanently yet. Nabla also says it has signed a partnership to use AMI’s models as they are developed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nabla has raised $120 million in total from an all-star list of backers, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nabla-raises-70m-series-c-to-deliver-agentic-ai-to-the-heart-of-clinical-workflows-bringing-total-funding-to-120m-302483646.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">including a $70 million Series C in June</a>. LeCun is one of Nabla’s investors, as is Tony Fadell’s Build Collective, HV Capital, Highland Europe, and Cathay Innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nabla’s LeBrun could be a good choice for CEO. He’s been building multimodal AI since before anyone called it that, working at Nuance Communications in the early 2010s, which originally powered Apple’s Siri in those long-ago years when Siri was wow technology. (Microsoft eventually acquired Nuance.) He founded and sold a couple of natural language startups, including one to Facebook. Then he ran Facebook’s AI division before founding Nabla in 2018, according to his LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeBrun said that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-another-24-million-for-its-ai-assistant-for-doctors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nabla, a darling of the Paris-based AI startup community</a>, is still growing well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have more than tripled our live ARR this year. Up next to $1B!” LeBrun wrote as he announced his departure as CEO. The founder says he will remain on at Nabla as chairman and chief AI scientist. Nabla declined further comment and AMI did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And the data provides a convincing argument. According to YouTube, viewers watched over <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcasts-living-room-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">700 million hours</a> of podcasts each month on living room devices (like TVs) in 2025, up from 400 million per month last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As people begin to spend less time watching traditional television, and more time watching short form or low-cost, low-production value content on YouTube, that might present a long-term competitive threat to Netflix,” Matthew Dysart, an entertainment attorney and former head of podcast business affairs at Spotify, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While podcasters might understand the motivation, not everyone is convinced about Netflix’s move. Some podcasters told TechCrunch they’re not sure there is long-term value in video podcasts, while others are worried Netflix is contributing to a podcast bubble.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re basically saying, ‘We want to be the king of content, and the only way we’re going to do that is if we take a swipe at YouTube,’” podcaster Ronald Young Jr. told TechCrunch. Young Jr. thinks people are turning on video podcasts and letting them play in the background, noting that ESPN has been doing some version of this for much longer than we’ve been able to name it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-buzz-of-video-podcasts\">The buzz of video podcasts</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When independent podcasters Mike Schubert and Sequoia Simone launched their new show <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/protalkpod/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“Professional Talkers”</a> this year, they noted the buzz around video podcasts and decided to start the new show as a video-first production on YouTube and Spotify.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Neither of us had done video before, so we were like, ‘Why don’t we just start from the beginning and make this a video show?’” Schubert told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Schubert found that his audience was ambivalent toward the video, perhaps because he has spent nearly a decade releasing audio podcasts, cultivating a fanbase that already enjoys and expects audio content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We posted an audio-only episode, and it did pretty similarly, numbers-wise,” he said. “So why would we put so much time and effort into the video and then run the risk of the episode being late when we can just do audio only?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Young Jr. considered investing more energy into video, but decided against it — like Schubert and Simone, he realized that he built an audience that prefers listening to podcasts over viewing them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m like, ‘Well who am I pivoting for?’” he said. “And I realized that the pivot would be for advertisers, for podcast executives, and for people who think that video is the direction that everyone’s going.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, there are some consumers who want to see video — even as a passive show to turn on in the background — as evidenced by YouTube’s staggering viewership stats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mikah Sargent, a podcast producer and host at <a href=\"https://twit.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">TWiT.tv</a>, works with shows like “This Week in Tech,” which have had a video component for more than 15 years. <em>(Disclosure: I co-host a show at TWiT.tv once per month.)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Something that I regularly hear from our listeners is … ‘you were my background when I was going through a rough time, or I needed to travel across the country, and having you there to listen to helped me pass the time,’” Sargent told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of passed time with podcasts. So Netflix can look at that and go, ‘Ooh, we get to have this thing that in some cases takes up more time and more streaming than you would get with a typical show.’”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-a-podcast-anyway\">What is a podcast anyway?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a disconnect between how creators and tech companies each think about podcasts. For people who make podcasts, a podcast can be a conversational show like the ones on YouTube, but it can also be a format that doesn’t translate seamlessly to video, like scripted fiction with sound design and voice actors, or the kind of reported, refined audio stories you’d find on NPR. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think this has to do with how squishy the word podcast is now,” podcaster Eric Silver told TechCrunch. “It means anything. It just means show now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For these independent creators, the corporate goings-on between Netflix and Spotify don’t immediately impact their day-to-day. But podcasters remember what happened when Spotify bought up and consolidated a significant chunk of the industry, created a bubble, then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/spotify-layoffs-podcast-industry-fallout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">burst that same bubble itself</a>. The impact reverberated across the industry with <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/spotify-layoffs-the-ringer-podcast-studios-1236420307/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">studio closures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/business/spotify-layoffs-gimlet-podcasts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">layoffs</a>, and a conception among onlookers that podcasting was “dead.” So when another Big Tech company comes waltzing into their industry, they’re skeptical. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In any form of entertainment and media, when companies consolidate, the people who currently have power continue to get richer and richer than the industry underneath it,” Silver said. “The future gets more and more murky, and has less and less resources.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix isn’t making as extreme moves as Spotify. The latter company spent billions acquiring several tech startups and studios, allowing Spotify to control the entire process of making a podcast, from the recording software to the ad sales tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that what Netflix is doing is a little bit more calculated than what Spotify did,” Young Jr. said. “Spotify blindly threw money at the top creators, and they kind of cratered the market in doing so, because the minute you value Joe Rogan at $250 million … you value them so highly that the regular podcaster is like, where do I fall on this?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s seen as an industry-changing infusion of money into the podcast industry isn’t actually that staggering for a company like Netflix, which is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-earnings-top-estimates-but-stock-slips-on-elevated-expectations-133606430.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">on track</a> to make about $45 billion this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Netflix and Spotify are similar in that way — aggressive moves to test a new value proposition by targeting top performers and spending money that ultimately is not that substantial from the perspective of a global tech platform, but is meaningful to the creator economy, to quickly learn if there’s a ‘there’ there,” Dysart said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix has only made deals with media companies thus far, rather than individual creators like Spotify did, but Dysart thinks Netflix’s investments are only beginning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I would expect Netflix to at some point go try to strike a nine-figure deal with a top podcast creator,” he added.  “I would also expect Netflix to take really big swings with very high-profile personalities on original podcasts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Netflix gets its way, our culture will shift away from watching programmatic daytime TV and talk shows and toward watching podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Back in the day, my mom would have a soap opera playing in the background while she was doing things, and I was definitely the person who would have ‘The Office’ playing in the background while I’m doing things,” Sargent said. “Now people get to have a podcast playing in the background while they’re doing things, and if Netflix can be the place where they go to do that, then I think it’s a win for the company.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Still, questions remain about how consistently such policies will translate into practice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updates come as the AI industry generally, and OpenAI in particular, faces increased <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/ftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others/\">scrutiny from policymakers</a>, educators, and child-safety advocates after several teenagers allegedly died by suicide after prolonged conversations with AI chatbots. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gen Z, which includes those born between 1997 and 2012, are the <a href=\"https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employee-engagement/gen-zs-connect-more-with-chatgpt-than-colleagues/553325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">most active users of OpenAI’s chatbot</a>. And following <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/disneys-openai-deal-is-exclusive-for-just-one-year-then-its-open-season/\">OpenAI’s recent deal with Disney</a>, more young people may flock to the platform, which lets you do everything from ask for help with homework to generate images and videos on thousands of topics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-and-bipartisan-coalition-urge-big-tech-companies-address\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">42 state attorneys general signed a letter</a> to Big Tech companies, urging them to implement safeguards on AI chatbots to protect children and vulnerable people. And as the Trump administration works out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/trumps-ai-executive-order-promises-one-rulebook-startups-may-get-legal-limbo-instead/\">what the federal standard on AI regulation</a> might look like, policymakers like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) have introduced <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/3062/text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legislation</a> that would ban minors from interacting with AI chatbots altogether. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s updated <a href=\"https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-12-18.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Model Spec</a>, which lays out behavior guidelines for its large language models, builds on existing specifications that prohibit the models from generating sexual content involving minors, or encouraging self-harm, delusions, or mania. This would work together with an upcoming age-prediction model that would identify when an account belongs to a minor and automatically roll out teen safeguards. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compared with adult users, the models are subject to stricter rules when a teenager is using them. Models are instructed to avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and first-person sexual or violent roleplay, even when it’s non-graphic. The specification also calls for extra caution around subjects like body image and disordered eating behaviors, and instructs the models to prioritize communicating about safety over autonomy when harm is involved and avoid advice that would help teens conceal unsafe behavior from caregivers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI specifies that these limits should hold even when prompts are framed as “fictional, hypothetical, historical, or educational” — common tactics that rely on role-play or edge-case scenarios in order to get an AI model to deviate from its guidelines. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-actions-speak-louder-than-words\"><strong>Actions speak louder than words</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077807\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png 1934w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=768,539 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=1200,843 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=1280,899 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=430,302 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=720,506 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=900,632 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=800,562 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=1536,1079 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=668,469 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=534,375 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=879,617 879w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=708,497 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.47-PM.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">OpenAI’s model behavior guidelines prohibit first-person romantic role-playing with teens.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says the key safety practices for teens are underpinned by four principles that guide the models’ approach: </p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Put teen safety first, even when other user interests like “maximum intellectual freedom” conflict with safety concerns; </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Promote real-world support by guiding teens towards family, friends, and local professionals for well-being; </li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Treat teens like teens by speaking with warmth and respect, not condescension or treating them like adults; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-block-list-item\">Be transparent by explaining what the assistant can and cannot do, and remind teens that it is not a human.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document also shares several examples of the chatbot explaining why it can’t “roleplay as your girlfriend” or “help with extreme appearance changes or risky shortcuts.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lily Li, a privacy and AI lawyer and founder of Metaverse Law, said it was encouraging to see OpenAI take steps to have its chatbot decline to engage in such behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Explaining that one of the biggest complaints advocates and parents have about chatbots is that they relentlessly promote ongoing engagement in a way that can be addictive for teens, she said: “I am very happy to see OpenAI say, in some of these responses, we can’t answer your question. The more we see that, I think that would break the cycle that would lead to a lot of inappropriate conduct or self-harm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, examples are just that: cherry-picked instances of how OpenAI’s safety team would like the models to behave. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">Sycophancy</a>, or an AI chatbot’s tendency to be overly agreeable with the user, has been listed as a prohibited behavior in previous versions of the Model Spec, but ChatGPT still engaged in that behavior anyway. That was particularly true with GPT-4o, a model that has been associated with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">several instances of what experts are calling “AI psychosis.”</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting kids in the digital world, raised concerns about potential conflicts within the Model Spec’s under-18 guidelines. He highlighted tensions between safety-focused provisions and the “no topic is off limits” principle, which directs models to address any topic regardless of sensitivity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have to understand how the different parts of the spec fit together,” he said, noting that certain sections may push systems toward engagement over safety. His organization’s testing revealed that ChatGPT often mirrors users’ energy, sometimes resulting in responses that aren’t contextually appropriate or aligned with user safety, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Adam Raine, a teenager who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\">died by suicide after months of dialogue</a> with ChatGPT, the chatbot engaged in such mirroring, their conversations show. That case also brought to light how OpenAI’s moderation API failed to prevent unsafe and harmful interactions despite flagging more than 1,000 instances of ChatGPT mentioning suicide and 377 messages containing self-harm content. But that wasn’t enough to stop Adam from continuing his conversations with ChatGPT. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an interview with TechCrunch in September, former OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler said this was because, historically, OpenAI had run classifiers (the automated systems that label and flag content) in bulk after the fact, not in real time, so they didn’t properly gate the user’s interaction with ChatGPT. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI now uses automated classifiers to assess text, image, and audio content in real time, according to the firm’s <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12315553-parental-controls-on-chatgpt-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">updated parental controls</a> document. The systems are designed to detect and block content related to child sexual abuse material, filter sensitive topics, and identify self-harm. If the system flags a prompt that suggests a serious safety concern, a small team of trained people will review the flagged content to determine if there are signs of “acute distress,” and may notify a parent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Torney applauded OpenAI’s recent steps toward safety, including its transparency in publishing guidelines for users under 18 years old. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not all companies are publishing their policy guidelines in the same way,” Torney said, pointing to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/leaked-meta-ai-rules-show-chatbots-were-allowed-to-have-romantic-chats-with-kids/https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/leaked-meta-ai-rules-show-chatbots-were-allowed-to-have-romantic-chats-with-kids/\">Meta’s leaked guidelines</a>, which showed that the firm let its chatbots engage in sensual and romantic conversations with children. “This is an example of the type of transparency that can support safety researchers and the general public in understanding how these models actually function and how they’re supposed to function.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, though, it is the actual behavior of an AI system that matters, Adler told TechCrunch on Thursday. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I appreciate OpenAI being thoughtful about intended behavior, but unless the company measures the actual behaviors, intentions are ultimately just words,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Put differently: What’s missing from this announcement is evidence that ChatGPT actually follows the guidelines set out in the Model Spec. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-paradigm-shift\"><strong>A paradigm shift</strong></h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077806\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png 1950w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=300,281 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=768,718 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=680,636 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=1200,1122 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=1280,1197 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=430,402 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=720,673 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=900,842 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=800,748 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=1536,1437 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=668,625 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=401,375 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=660,617 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=568,531 568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-12.27.39-PM.png?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">OpenAI’s Model Spec guides ChatGPT to steer conversations away from encouraging poor self-image.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Experts say with these guidelines, OpenAI appears poised to get ahead of certain legislation, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/\">California’s SB 243</a>, a recently signed bill regulating AI companion chatbots that goes into effect in 2027. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Model Spec’s new language language mirrors some of the law’s main requirements around prohibiting chatbots from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill also requires platforms to provide alerts every three hours to minors reminding them they are speaking to a chatbot, not a real person, and they should take a break. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked how often ChatGPT would remind teens that they’re talking to a chatbot and ask them to take a break, an OpenAI spokesperson did not share details, saying only that the company trains its models to represent themselves as AI and remind users of that, and that it implements break reminders during “long sessions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also shared two new <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/a-family-guide-to-help-teens-use-ai-responsibly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI literacy resources</a> for parents and families. The <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/tips-for-talking-to-your-teen-about-ai.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tips</a> include conversation starters and guidance to help parents talk to teens about what AI can and can’t do, build critical thinking, set healthy boundaries, and navigate sensitive topics. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taken together, the documents formalize an approach that shares responsibility with caretakers: OpenAI spells out what the models should do, and offers families a framework for supervising how it’s used. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The focus on parental responsibility is notable because it mirrors Silicon Valley talking points. In its <a href=\"https://a16z.com/a-roadmap-for-federal-ai-legislation-protect-people-empower-builders-win-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recommendations for federal AI regulation</a> posted this week, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz suggested more disclosure requirements for child safety, rather than restrictive requirements, and weighted the onus more toward parental responsibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several of OpenAI’s principles — safety-first when values conflict; nudging users toward real-world support; reinforcing that the chatbot isn’t a person — are being articulated as teen guardrails. But <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">several adults have died by suicide and suffered life-threatening delusions</a>, which invites an obvious follow-up: Should those defaults apply across the board, or does OpenAI see them as trade-offs it’s only willing to enforce when minors are involved?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An OpenAI spokesperson countered that the firm’s safety approach is designed to protect all users, saying the Model Spec is just one component of a multi-layered strategy.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li says it has been a “bit of a wild west” so far regarding the legal requirements and tech companies’ intentions. But she feels laws like SB 243, which requires tech companies to disclose their safeguards publicly, will change the paradigm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The legal risks will show up now for companies if they advertise that they have these safeguards and mechanisms in place on their website, but then don’t follow through with incorporating these safeguards,” Li said. “Because then, from a plaintiff’s point of view, you’re not just looking at the standard litigation or legal complaints; you’re also looking at potential unfair, deceptive advertising complaints.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Buoyed by these signals, the startup has raised $9.7 million from investors, including Forerunner and NFX, along with Pear VC and Coelius Capital. Notably, this is the first dating app investment for Forerunner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Celeste is a really thoughtful founder who understands the mindset of the consumer, which is a young female, to be honest. There are other people who can be focused on the male demographic, but she is focused on the young female who has a lot of unspoken desires and needs that, if you put them in a profile, they would never say, this versus that. And I think in a conversation, you can get a lot of those nuances out, but in the past, the conversation required a $10,000 matchmaker,” Eurie Kim, a partner at Forerunner, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amadon said she has always been very interested in social impact at scale and thinks dating is inherently one of the biggest problems facing her generation. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’ve been a million pieces written about the loneliness epidemic in the U.S. And I do really think that it’s our generation’s largest problem,” said Amadon, who, along with Allen, dropped out of Stanford to build the startup. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077687\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg 2052w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Date-Planned.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Known</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app, which is being testedin San Francisco in beta, uses voice AI-powered onboarding to ask several questions to users without having them fill out any forms. Amadon said because of this modality, the startup is able to know more about users and provide them with great matches, with one user’s onboarding clocking in at an hour and 38 minutes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Known, when people typed their responses out, they would edit them. With voice, the onboarding is more personable. The company’s AI can ask dynamic follow-ups based on the conversation. For instance, if someone has newly moved to the city, the AI can ask them what they like and dislike about their experience thus far.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once the onboarding is complete, the AI suggests potential matches to users. They can ask AI agents about those profiles. If they like a profile, they can tap on “interested.” When two people are matched, they have 24 hours to accept the introduction and 24 hours to agree to a date. The company said that with this mechanism, the app aims to avoid lingering chats and ghosting while encouraging people to meet in real life. After their dates, users can provide their feedback to the AI and get more refined recommendations for matches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Known hasn’t completely ditched the restaurant idea. The app also helps in picking restaurants based on user likes and dislikes. Using the AI chat and calendar integrations, users can also indicate their availability for the first dates. In the beta phase, the company charged $30 per successful date. However, the startup is not set on the price and said it will experiment with different models to find out what payment modality works the best.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077688\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg 2052w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/After-Date.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Known</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today the startup has three full-time engineers and four people working on go-to-market, with several contractors working in all areas.

The streamer said Friday it plans to use the startup’s development tools and infrastructure to build avatars that will allow Netflix subscribers to carry their personas and fandom across different games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Ready Player Me had raised $72 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/ready-player-me-a-platform-to-build-dynamic-cross-game-avatars-for-virtual-worlds-raises-56m-led-by-a16z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in venture backing from investors</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readyplayer.me/blog/series-b-announcement-a16z\">including</a> a16z, Endeavor, Konvoy Ventures, Plural, and various angels, including the co-founders of companies like Roblox, Twitch, and King Games.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix told TechCrunch the startup’s team of around 20 people will be joining the company. Of the four founders Rainer Selvet, Haver Järveoja, Kaspar Tiri, and Timmu Tõke, only CTO Rainer Selvet is moving to Netflix. It doesn’t have an estimate of how long it will be until avatars launch. Nor does it detail which games or types of games will be first to get avatars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Following the acquisition, Ready Player Me will be winding down its services on January 31, 2026, including its online avatar creation tool, <a href=\"https://playerzero.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">PlayerZero</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077751\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp 1425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=1200,868 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=1280,926 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=430,311 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=720,521 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=900,651 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=800,579 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=668,483 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=518,375 518w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=853,617 853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=708,512 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/imgi_9_Posed-GroupShot.webp?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ready Player Me</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds,” Ready Player Me CEO Timmu Tõke said in a statement. “We’ve been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time.

That strategy saw mixed results. While some of its larger, more well-known titles may have attracted some customers, like GTA: San Andreas, others were virtually unknown. (The company recently said the <a href=\"https://mobilegamer.biz/netflix-games-ditches-top-performer-gta-san-andreas-as-reboot-continues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GTA game was on its way out</a>, too, alongside dozens of other titles.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix <a href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-shutters-squid-game-unleashed-developer-boss-fight-entertainment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">also</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/stranger-things-game-developer-bonusxp-shut-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shut</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-shuts-down-game-studio-behind-squid-game-unleashed-2025-10-24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">down</a> <a href=\"https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.animationmagazine.net/2024/10/netflix-shuts-down-aaa-video-game-studio-before-first-release/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">of</a> its studio acquisitions or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-is-getting-rid-of-another-of-its-game-studios-by-selling-it-back-to-its-founders-203645232.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">returned them to their founders</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To some extent, these changes could have been anticipated.

It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Naver’s capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton’s $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Krafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content, and fintech spaces.

The year started with a brazen cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the U.S. Treasury, followed by the breaching of several federal agencies, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/hundreds-of-organizations-breached-by-sharepoint-mass-hacks/\">agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. nuclear weapons</a>, thanks to a SharePoint security flaw. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All the while, the Russian hackers were stealing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/russian-government-hackers-said-to-be-behind-us-federal-court-filing-system-hack-report/\">sealed records from the U.S. Courts’ filing system</a>, sending alarm bells ringing across the federal judiciary.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But nothing quite came as close as DOGE ripping through federal government departments and databases in what became the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/doge-biggest-breach-of-united-states-government-data-under-way/\">biggest raid of U.S. government data in its history</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Tesla CEO Elon Musk, with a visible black eye, listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025\" class=\"wp-image-3077706\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg 1995w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-breaches-doge-2217856070.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Tesla CEO Elon Musk, with a visible black eye, listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025 in Washington, DC.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE as it was widely known, led by Elon Musk and his band of private sector lackeys, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/doge-staffer-violated-treasury-rules-by-emailing-unencrypted-personal-data/\">violated federal protocols</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/doge-staffer-with-access-to-americans-personal-data-leaked-private-xai-api-key/\">defied common security practices</a>. They <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/doge-uploaded-live-copy-of-social-security-database-to-vulnerable-cloud-server-says-whistleblower/\">ransacked federal databases of citizens’ data</a>, despite warnings of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/01/senator-warns-of-national-security-risks-after-elon-musks-doge-granted-full-access-to-sensitive-treasury-systems/\">the national security risks</a> and conflicts of interests over Musk’s overseas business dealings. Legal experts say that DOGE staffers are “personally liable” under U.S. hacking laws, though a court would also have to agree.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s subsequent, very public falling out with President Trump saw the billionaire leave DOGE, and left staffers fearing that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/doge-days-are-over-as-trump-disbands-elon-musks-team-of-federal-cost-cutters/\">they could face federal charges</a> without his protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In late September, senior executives at American corporate giants <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/dozens-of-organizations-had-data-stolen-in-oracle-linked-hacks/\">began receiving threatening emails</a> from a prolific ransomware and extortion group called Clop. The emails included an attached copy of their personal information — and a ransom demand for several million dollars not to publish it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Months earlier, the Clop gang had quietly exploited a never-before-seen vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business software, a suite of applications used for hosting a company’s core business information, such as financial and human resources records, supply chain data, and customer databases. The vulnerability allowed Clop to steal reams of sensitive employee data, including data belonging to executives, from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/dozens-of-organizations-had-data-stolen-in-oracle-linked-hacks/\">dozens of organizations</a> that rely on Oracle’s software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oracle had no idea until it was caught out in October as it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/clop-hackers-caught-exploiting-oracle-zero-day-bug-to-steal-executives-personal-data/\">scrambling to patch the vulnerability</a>. It was too late, though: The hackers had already stolen gobs of data from <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/university-pennsylvania-oracle-e-business-suite-clop-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">universities</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/news/cl0p-cyberattack-update-18178/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hospitals and health systems</a>, <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/washington-post-oracle-clop-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">media organizations</a>, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was Clop’s most recent mass-hacking campaign. The group had previously exploited flaws in enterprise file-transfer services, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/fortra-goanywhere-clop-ransomware/\">GoAnywhere</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/microsoft-clop-moveit-hacks-victims/\">MOVEit</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/24/clop-ransomware-gang-takes-credit-for-latest-mass-hack-that-breached-dozens-of-companies/\">Cleo Software</a>, which tech giants use to share large amounts of information over the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce customers had a rough year after two separate data breaches at downstream tech companies allowed hackers to steal a billion records of customer data stored in Salesforce’s cloud. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers targeted at least two companies, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/salesloft-says-drift-customer-data-thefts-linked-to-march-github-account-hack/\">Salesloft</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/google-says-hackers-stole-data-from-200-companies-following-gainsight-breach/\">Gainsight</a>, both of which allow their customers to handle and analyze the data that they store in Salesforce. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By breaching these companies directly, the hackers gained access to all of the data through their customer connections to Salesforce. Some of the largest tech giants had data stolen in the breaches, including Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Docusign, GitLab, LinkedIn, SonicWall, and Verizon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, made up of members from different hacking groups, including ShinyHunters, published a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/hacking-group-claims-theft-of-1-billion-records-from-salesforce-customer-databases/\">data leak site advertising the stolen records</a> in exchange for a ransom paid by the victims. New victims are still rolling in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hackers tore through the U.K. retail sector earlier this year, stealing data from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/marks-spencer-confirms-customers-personal-data-was-stolen-in-hack/\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> and at least <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/uk-retail-giant-co-op-confirms-hackers-stole-all-6-5-million-customer-records/\">6.5 million customer records from the Co-op</a>. The back-to-back hacks sparked outages and disruption across the retailers’ networks, and some grocery shelves went empty as the systems used to support the retailers were knocked out. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq5w324pd3o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Luxury store Harrods</a> was also later hacked.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"BIRMINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM - SEPTEMBER 30: An aerial view of JLR signage at the Jaguar Land Rover vehicle manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich on September 30, 2025 in Birmingham, United Kingdom.\" class=\"wp-image-3077707\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg 1995w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=680,489 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=1200,863 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=1280,920 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=430,309 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=720,518 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=900,647 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=800,575 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=1536,1104 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=668,480 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=522,375 522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=858,617 858w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=708,509 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jag-land-rover-2238334107.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">An aerial view of JLR signage at the Jaguar Land Rover vehicle manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich on September 30, 2025 in Birmingham, United Kingdom, following its hack and data breach.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Christopher Furlong / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a major cyberattack targeting Jaguar Land Rover, one of the country’s biggest employers, left a dent in the U.K. economy. A September <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-data-stolen-in-disruptive-cyberattack/\">hack and data breach</a> saw JLR’s car plant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/jaguar-land-rover-to-pause-production-for-third-week-due-to-cyberattack/\">stall production for months</a> as the company worked to get its systems back up and running. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fallout affected JLR’s suppliers across the U.K., some of whom went out of business altogether. The U.K. government ended up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/uk-government-bails-out-jaguar-land-rover-with-1-5b-loan-after-hack-disrupts-vehicle-production-for-weeks/\">guaranteeing a bailout to the tune of £1.5 billion</a> to ensure Jaguar Land Rover employees and suppliers got paid during the shutdown. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.K. security experts said the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9pdld4y81o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">breach was the most economically damaging cyberattack</a> to hit the United Kingdom in history, showing that disruption may be more valuable for financially motivated hackers than stolen data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea experienced a major data breach every month this year, and the personal data of millions of its citizens was compromised thanks to security lapses and shoddy data practices at the country’s biggest tech and phone providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The country’s largest phone company, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/a-timeline-of-south-korean-telco-giant-skts-data-breach/\">SK Telecom, was hacked and 23 million customer records</a> were exposed; several cyberattacks were attributed to its hostile North Korean neighbor; and a <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/question-of-the-day/how-much-government-data-was-lost-in-a-data-center-fire-in-south-korea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">massive data center fire</a> wiped out years of Korean government data that wasn’t backed up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the cherry on the data breach cake was the months-long theft of some 33 million customers’ personal information from Coupang, the country’s retail giant that some call Asia’s Amazon. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/koreas-coupang-says-data-breach-exposed-nearly-34m-customers-personal-information/\">data theft began in June</a>, but wasn’t detected until November, and ultimately led to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/ceo-of-south-korean-retail-giant-coupang-resigns-after-massive-data-breach/\">company’s chief executive</a> resigning.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok has reached a deal to cede a substantial portion of its U.S. operation to a group of American investors, thus ending a years-long tussle in which the federal government has sought to force the platform to do just that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new partnership is described as a “new TikTok U.S. joint venture” in an internal memo from ByteDance CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That arrangement will see major American investors take over significant control of the U.S.-based business. The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/tiktok-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">originally reported by Axios</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/trump-signs-executive-order-approving-tiktok-deal/\">an executive order</a> signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/oracle-silver-lake-mgx-tiktok.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously reported</a> that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/september-19?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">except to say that</a> it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok’s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">national security concerns</a> as the rationale.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
