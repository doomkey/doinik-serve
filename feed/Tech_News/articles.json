The company on Thursday announced the official launch of a trio of options, including Split View, PDF annotations, and a “Save to Google Drive” feature, designed to more deeply integrate Chrome with one of Google’s other online services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While these particular additions aren’t focused on AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/google-brings-gemini-in-chrome-to-us-users-unveils-agentic-browsing-capabilities-and-more/\">Google already integrated its Gemini AI assistant into Chrome</a>. The move was made in response to the increased competition from AI providers like OpenAI and Perplexity, which are dabbling in agentic browsers. These so-called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/as-the-browser-wars-heat-up-here-are-the-hottest-alternatives-to-chrome-and-safari-in-2025/\">browser wars</a> have pushed Google to be less stagnant in terms of developing and releasing more consumer-facing features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Split View, multitasking in Chrome has become easier as the feature puts two pages side-by-side in the same tab. This lets you work across two webpages or watch a video while taking notes, among other things. To use the feature, you’ll drag a tab to the left or right edge of the browser window or right-click a link and select “Open Link in Split View.” The tabs will automatically snap into place. When no longer needed, you can exit the Split View layout via an option found via a right-click.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094518\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=430,278 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=720,466 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=900,582 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=800,518 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=668,432 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=580,375 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=954,617 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=708,458 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chrome_Productivity_Blog_Split_V.width-1000.format-webp.webp?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another practical addition is the PDF annotations feature, which lets you add notes to a PDF or highlight its text from the browser. This means you don’t have to download the PDF and then open it in another application to work with its content. The option, a long time coming, could make it much simpler to do basic PDF tasks, like digitally signing a document, filling out a form, making notes within a file or personal document, and more. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094513\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg 1380w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=1200,774 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=1280,826 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=430,277 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=720,464 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=900,580 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=800,516 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=668,431 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=581,375 581w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=957,617 957w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=708,457 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chrome-update-at-1.12.43-PM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, the new Save to Google Drive feature will allow you to save any PDF directly to your Google Drive account, instead of your computer, where it may get lost.

The move comes as Reddit launched its <a href=\"https://www.business.reddit.com/blog/dynamic-product-ads-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first shoppable ad product</a> last year, called Dynamic Product Ads (DPA), which display personalized product recommendations to users based on their interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, when users who are part of the test search for something like “best noise-canceling headphones” or “electronic gift ideas for a college student,” they will see a carousel of related products at the bottom of the results. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This carousel will feature products directly mentioned by users from conversations on related posts and comments. If users tap on the product, they can view more details and then be directed to the retailer to purchase the item. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This feature surfaces top-recommended products directly from discussions, giving redditors instant information about any product,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/news/in-case-you-saw-it-we-are-testing-a-new-shopping-product-experience-in-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “This test is designed to make Reddit easier to navigate while keeping community perspectives at the center of the experience. We’ll continue learning from how people use this new feature and refine the experience over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While platforms like TikTok and Instagram have long integrated shopping features, Reddit is now looking to follow suit. Of course, Reddit isn’t the only tech platform that recently started exploring AI-driven shopping, as OpenAI’s ChatGPT rolled out an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\">“Instant Checkout”</a> feature last September that lets users make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thursday’s announcement comes after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/\">Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said</a> during the company’s earnings release last week that the platforms’s AI search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business, not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Huffman also noted that weekly active users for search grew 30% over the past year, increasing from 60 million to 80 million, while weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers feature rose from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Starting April 2026, the website will no longer be available. If users still want to send and receive messages on the web, they can do so while logged into Facebook. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After messenger.com goes away, you will be automatically redirected to use <a href=\"https://facebook.com/messages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">facebook.com/messages</a> for messaging on a computer,” the help page reads. “You can continue your conversations there or on the Messenger mobile app.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you use Messenger without a Facebook account, then you’ll only be able to continue your conversations on the Messenger mobile app. Users can restore their chat history on any platform using the PIN they entered when they first created a backup on Messenger. If you can’t remember your PIN, you can reset it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes a few months after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/facebook-messengers-desktop-app-is-no-more/\">Meta shut down Messenger’s stand-alone desktop apps</a> for Windows and Mac. The writing may have been on the wall at the time, as Meta had been redirecting existing desktop app users to the Facebook website to continue using the messaging service, rather than the Messenger website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change was first spotted by reverse engineer <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/2023763715674566705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>. Meta is notifying users of the update via a pop-up message on the Messenger website and app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users have taken to social media to <a href=\"https://x.com/_snow118/status/2023722050783945129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">express their frustration</a> with the update, with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1r6pxzp/why_does_meta_keep_removing_every_service_that/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many saying</a> they don’t want to rely on the Facebook website to send and receive Messenger chats on the web, especially those who have deactivated their Facebook accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Meta’s decision to shut down various Messenger platforms is frustrating for users, it allows the tech giant to reduce costs by leaving it with fewer platforms to maintain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Messenger first launched as “Facebook Chat” back in 2008, and Facebook (now Meta) launched Facebook Messenger as a standalone app in 2011. Over the years, the tech giant positioned Messenger as its own service outside of Facebook, and in 2014, the social network removed messaging capabilities from its main mobile app to push people to the Messenger app. However, the company reversed this in 2023 when it began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/07/facebooks-latest-test-brings-back-in-app-messaging/\">merging Messenger</a> back into the Facebook app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While we are disappointed by the Governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety. We will continue to engage constructively with the Governor, the Legislature, and officials around the state to deliver this proven mobility option that New Yorkers are waiting for,” added Waymo’s statement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hochul had introduced, as part of her <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/new-york-governor-clears-path-for-robotaxis-everywhere-with-one-notable-exception/\">broader budget proposal</a>, a plan to change a state law that mandates drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That law essentially prevents robotaxi companies like Waymo from operating in the state since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Hochul’s proposal had survived, it would not have opened the floodgates to AV companies. The proposal contained a number of limitations, including that AV companies could not deploy for-hire robotaxi services in any city with more than a million people. AV companies would also need approval from the state’s transportation commissioner, pay a $1 million fee, and show proof of financial security of at least $5 million. The state would have only backed robotaxi pilots in cities or townships where there was a clear demonstration of local support, Butler said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that proposal dead, the state’s existing AV pilot program, which is far more restrictive, is expected to remain. Under the pilot program, companies can seek an exemption to the one-hand on the wheel rule, allowing them to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state, but not launch commercial robotaxi services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is currently testing in New York City, and is allowed to do so through March 31. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New York City regulators granted a permit last August to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city. Under that permit, Waymo is allowed to test up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, as long as there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is active in numerous other states and operates commercial robotaxi services in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it provides more than 400,000 paid rides every week and is targeting one million weekly rides by the end of the year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The trial, taking place in L.A. Superior Court, already revealed that Meta’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/metas-own-research-found-parental-supervision-doesnt-really-help-curb-teens-compulsive-social-media-use/\">own research indicated</a> that parental supervision couldn’t prevent teens from compulsive use of social media, and teens who faced traumatic life experiences were even more inclined to overuse social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for the plaintiff, a 20-year-old who goes by her initials KGM, questioned Zuckerberg this week about whether Instagram employees were given goals to increase daily app usage. The Meta CEO had said during an earlier Congressional hearing that this was not the case, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-trial-testimony-instagram-c8cbaa32ccbf4933ec3a7beebd6cf34b\">the AP noted</a>, but a 2015 email chain presented as evidence in the trial showed Zuckerberg pushing to increase <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-trial-0e9a7fa0\">users’ time spent in app by 12%</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg was also asked about Instagram’s use of beauty filters, which Meta’s own experts said should be banned when it comes to teens, as well as internal documents with Meta’s estimates of how many children under the age of 13 were on the platform. One <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-grilled-during-landmark-social-media-addiction-trial/\">Meta document from 2018 <span>stated that</span></a><span>, a</span>s of 2015, 4 million children under 13 had Instagram accounts, including roughly 30% of children aged 10-12 in the U.S., for instance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying age verification was difficult and smartphone makers like Apple could be more helpful on this front. (Apple recently rolled out its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\">own age assurance tools</a> for developers, as a result of the increasing push to regulate apps like Facebook and Instagram in the U.S., where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/apple-prepares-to-comply-with-texas-age-assurance-law-but-warns-of-privacy-risks/\">many</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/new-utah-law-makes-app-stores-responsible-for-age-verification/\">states</a> have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/social-media-and-children-2025-legislation\">now created or are developing</a> their own social media laws.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-trial-testimony-instagram-c8cbaa32ccbf4933ec3a7beebd6cf34b\">Reports from the courtroom</a> noted Zuckerberg largely stuck to the company’s talking points during his testimony, sometimes claiming the plaintiff’s lawyers were <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-trial-0e9a7fa0\">taking things out of context</a> or <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/meta-mark-zuckerberg-social-media-safety-trial.html\">mischaracterizing</a> what documents said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaintiff KGM (who also goes by her first name Kaley) sued four social media companies over what she alleges is the harmful and addictive nature of their platforms. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-joins-snap-to-settle-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">TikTok</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/snap-reaches-settlement-in-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">Snap</a> settled before the trial began, with YouTube and Meta defending their apps’ success. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the trial, lawyers for Meta have pointed to Kaley’s unhappy childhood as leading to her mental health concerns, not the social apps themselves. The results of this trial by jury could lead to big tech reforms, prompt new laws and regulations, and lead to a settlement with victims, if the tech companies are found to be at fault. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, new headlines and articles from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/feed/\">your favorite news site</a> would appear as new, unread entries in the RSS reader (aka news reader or feed reader) of your choice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The format was hugely popular in the early 2000s until the 2006 arrival of Twitter shifted people to another platform for real-time news and information sharing. Within a few years, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/rest-in-peace-rss/\">people were ditching Google’s popular RSS reader,</a> Google Reader, in favor of Twitter’s 140-character posts. Another few years later, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/rip-google-reader/\">Google Reader shut down for good</a>. (We still miss it.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But RSS itself never died. In addition to being the underlying tool for podcast distribution, you can still use the format to syndicate from websites through RSS apps like Feedly, NetNewsWire, Inoreader, <a href=\"https://reederapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reeder</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Current, however, proposes a different RSS experience.

Breaking news, for instance, remains bright for three hours, while daily news articles may stick around for around 18 hours.

This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After this story was published, a Tenga spokesperson told TechCrunch that the breach affected “approximately 600 people” in the United States, based on a forensic review. “We have already proactively contacted those who may have been impacted to ensure their safety and provide guidance,” said the spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#multi-factor-authentication\">multi-factor authentication</a>, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company spokesperson would not say if there was any multi-factor on the email account prior to the breach. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo.

Email addresses and phone numbers of parents, as well as information about children’s siblings, were also exposed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Florida-based VenturEd Solutions, which develops and maintains Ravenna Hub, <a href=\"https://www.ravennasolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">says</a> on Ravenna Hub’s website that it serves over a million students, and processes hundreds of thousands of applications a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch first learned of the vulnerability on Wednesday and soon after alerted the company. VenturEd fixed the bug the same day, but TechCrunch held this report until we could verify that the bug was fixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nick Laird, the chief executive of VenturEd Solutions, told TechCrunch in an email that the company was able to replicate the issue and has addressed the vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laird said the company was investigating the incident, but he would not commit to notifying users about the security lapse, or say — when asked by TechCrunch — if the company has the ability to check if there was any improper access to other users’ data. We also asked if Ravenna Hub had its security checked by a third-party, and if so, by whom. Laird would not say, and declined to comment further.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear who, if anyone, oversees cybersecurity at VenturEd and Ravenna Hub.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/cisa-nsa-australia-idor-flaws/\">common security flaw</a> that allows users to access stored information because of weak or non-existent security controls on the concerned servers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, the bug allowed any logged-in user to access another student’s data, including their personal information, by modifying the unique number associated with a student’s profile using their web browser’s address bar. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Ravenna Hub, student numbers are sequential, meaning it was possible for any user to access another student’s data by changing the profile number by one or more digits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch created a new account with test data, we found that the web address contained a seven-digit number. As such, there were slightly more than 1.63 million records prior to ours that were accessible to any other user.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the latest security lapse involving simple security flaws affecting the personal information of children. In January, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/ustrive-security-lapse-exposed-personal-data-of-its-users-including-children/\">online mentoring site UStrive exposed the personal information of its users</a>, many of whom are still in school. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Asare said he came to believe that the future lay in people managing AI employees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “And if that’s true, we’ll need a real system to manage them, with structure around onboarding, coordination, and oversight for digital workers,” he added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, the duo launched <a href=\"https://withreload.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reload</a>, an AI workforce management platform. On Thursday, the company announced its <a href=\"https://epic.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first AI product, Epic</a>, alongside a $2.275 million round led by Anthemis, with participation from Zeal Capital Partners, Plug and Play, Cohen Circle, Blueprint, and Axiom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reload is a platform that lets organizations manage their AI agents across teams and departments. Companies can connect agents, regardless of who built them (whether by a third party or internally), assign them roles and permissions, and track the work they perform. “Reload acts like the system of record for AI employees, providing visibility, coordination, and oversight as agents operate across functions,” said Asare, the company’s CEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, he observed, teams are using multiple agents simultaneously for tasks such as coding, debugging, and refactoring. The problem is that these agents are often focused solely on whatever they were prompted to do and don’t necessarily retain long-term memory of what a product is or why they were told to perform a specific function. They operate, in other words, with only short-term memory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, an agent can lose context, or the system can evolve away from its original intent. That’s why Reload is launching Epic. Built on top of the Reload platform, it serves as an architect alongside other coding agents, continuously defining a product’s requirements and constraints, and reminding agents what they are building and why, to keep a system consistent as it develops. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In software development specifically, coding agents can generate large amounts of code, but they don’t preserve shared system understanding over time,” Asare said. “Epic complements those agents by defining the system upfront and maintaining shared context as it evolves. It doesn’t replace coding agents; it makes them more effective.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epic is designed to live inside the coding environments where developers already work. It can be installed as an extension in AI-assisted code editors like Cursor and Windsurf, running alongside other agents inside these tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When a team starts a project, Epic helps create the core system artifacts such as product requirements, data models, API specifications, tech stack decisions, diagrams, and structured task breakdowns,” Asare said, adding that these are the foundations that coding agents build against. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As development progresses, Epic maintains a structured memory of decisions, code changes, and patterns,” he continued. “If you switch coding agents, your structure and memory follow. If multiple engineers use different agents on the same project, everyone builds against the same shared source of truth.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asare and Das previously had a company together that was acquired and this is their second company together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI infrastructure space is crowded. Competitors include LongChain, which helps with AI agent deployment and memory management, and CrewAI, which helps enterprises manage their AI agents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Das said Epic is different because it “defines the system upfront and maintains shared project-level context across agents and sessions,” with a focus specifically on building infrastructure to maintain AI employees. “Traditional workforce systems weren’t designed for AI agents operating as teammates,” said Das, who serves as the company’s CTO. “That’s the layer we’re focused on.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh capital will go toward hiring and product advancement, specifically expanding the infrastructure needed to support a growing number of AI agents. “We’re building for the next era of work,” Asare said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to add the other investors in the round. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, users can adjust the digital crown on the watch to set a target state of charge or adjust the temperature inside the vehicle. The app also allows users to pick four quick controls, depending on which they use the most.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some limitations, however, for Rivian’s first-generation R1T trucks and R1S SUVs. Owners of these cars will only be able to lock or unlock their vehicle by opening the app and tapping the lock icon on the Watch. Second-generation R1 vehicles, meanwhile, will unlock automatically as the driver approaches the car, provided a digital key has been set up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Apple Watch integration follows a broader update to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/techcrunch-mobility-rivians-savior/\">vehicle software system</a> that was rolled out on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most of the updates focus on improving performance and accessibility, including a “kneel mode” that lowers the vehicle another inch below its previous low setting. The update will also allow drivers to toggle between different drive modes without causing the advanced driver assistance system to disengage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a new cold weather indicator that will add a blue tint to the battery graphic displayed on the vehicle’s digital screen so drivers can see how much energy the battery pack is used for warming.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian makes and sells EVs, but software has become one of its central products, and a selling point, for consumers as well as companies like Volkswagen that have tapped the carmaker for its technology.

Companies like Apple and Qualcomm are in the early stages of making on-device AI more useful. Amid all that, the 14-person technical team of London-based <a href=\"https://trymirai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mirai</a> is working to improve how models run on phones and laptops.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai, which is backed by a $10 million seed round led by Uncork Capital, was founded by Dima Shvets and Alexey Moiseenkov last year. Both founders have experience in building scalable consumer apps. Shvets co-founded face-swapping app Reface, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/reface-grabs-5-5m-seed-led-by-a16z-to-stoke-its-viral-face-swap-video-app/\">which was backed by a16z</a>. Shvets later also became a scout for the venture firm. Moiseenkov was CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/prisma-uses-ai-to-turn-your-photos-into-graphic-novel-fodder-double-quick/\">the last decade’s viral AI filters app, Prisma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As consumer developers, both had been thinking about AI and machine learning on devices even before generative AI became popular, Shvets said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we met together in London, we started to chat about technology, and we realized that within the hype of GenAI and more AI adoption, everybody speaks about cloud, about servers, about AGI coming. But the missing piece is on-device [AI] for consumer hardware,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shvets and Moiseenkov wanted to use AI to create a pipeline that would allow them to enable complex tasks on the phone, which led them to start Mirai. When they asked others who developed consumer apps, they heard that many wanted better cost optimization and margin per token usage, too.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3094301\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=430,254 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=720,426 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=900,533 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=800,473 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=668,395 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=634,375 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=1043,617 1043w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=708,419 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mirai-cofounders1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Co-founders Alexey Moiseenkov and Dima Shvets</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Mirai</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Mirai is developing a framework for models so they can perform better on devices. The company has built an inference engine for Apple Silicon that optimizes on-device throughput. With its upcoming SDK, developers can integrate the runtime in their apps with only a few lines, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One of the visions why we started the company was that we wanted to give developers, like this Stripe-like, eight lines of code [integration] experience…you basically go to our platform, integrate the key, and start working with summarization, classification, or whatever your use case is,” Shvets said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup built this engine in Rust, which can bump up a model’s generation speed by up to 37%, they claim. The company said that, while tuning the model for a platform, it doesn’t tinker with model weights to ensure there is no loss in quality of the output.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai’s stack currently focuses on improving text and voice modalities on the platform, with plans to support vision in the future. The team has started to work with frontier model providers to tune their models for edge use and is in talks with different chipmakers. Later, it plans to bring its engine to Android, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Mirai aims to release on-device benchmarks so model makers can test on-device performance. Shvets recognizes that not all AI work can be done on-device, though. To enable a mixed mode of operation, the team is building an orchestration layer to send requests that can’t be fulfilled on the device up to the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the startup is not directly working with apps just yet, its engine could power on-device assistants, transcribers, translators, and chat apps, we’re told.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andy McLoughlin, managing partner at Uncork Capital, noted that he invested in an edge machine learning company in the last decade. He said that the company was early and eventually sold its business to Spotify. In today’s world, the situation is different, he thinks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Given the cost of cloud inference, something has to change… For now, VCs are happy to continue funding the rocket ship companies, spending inordinate sums on cloud inference. But that won’t last  —  at some point, people will focus on the underlying economics of these businesses and realize that something has to change,” he said. “It feels like every model maker will want to run part of their inference workloads at the edge, and Mirai feels very well-positioned to capture this demand.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirai’s seed round also saw participation from individuals, including Dreamer CEO David Singleton, YC Partner Francois Chaubard, Snowflake co-founder Marcin Żukowski, ElevenLabs co-founder Mati Staniszewski, former Google AdSense product manager and Coinbase board member Gokul Rajaram, Groq investor Scooter Braun, Turing.com CTO Vijay Krishnan, Theory Forge Ventures’ Ben Parr and Matt Schlicht, and ex-Netflix technical leader Aditya Jami.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He took a few stabs at starting new AI businesses, but nothing really stuck until he got a call from a friend who wanted help filling out customs paperwork.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu got “very curious” and started cold-calling customs brokers in the Los Angeles area. He learned that many are mom-and-pop affairs still deeply reliant on fax machines and paper. When his first customer showed him stacks of manila folders during a FaceTime tour of her office, everything clicked, Basu told TechCrunch. He flew to that customer’s office the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That was the eye-opening moment. There’s just papers and papers,” Basu said in a recent interview. “I was both shocked and impressed. Shocked that this is how the industry runs, and impressed that everything around us, from the watch that you’re wearing to the glasses, literally everything that’s imported, and this is what’s happening behind the scenes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This seed of an idea is now called Amari AI, a startup co-founded by Basu and Arushi Vashist, a former senior software engineer at LinkedIn. The pair, and their small team, have already collected more than 30 customers, and helped those firms move more than $15 billion of goods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amari has also raised $4.5 million of funding co-led by preeminent early-stage firms First Round Capital and Pear VC, all before coming out of stealth mode on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu has two goals with Amari. One is to help customs brokers modernize. To date, he said, many of them have done little work to integrate new technologies. Some leverage optical character recognition software to help speed up data entry, but that tech is limited and brittle, he said. Amari is meant to help automate data entry and paperwork, and let employees — who <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Oct/CBP%20Publication%201847-0622%20-%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Key%20Changes%2019%20CFR%20111%20Final%20Rule.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legally must be in the United States</a>, meaning companies can’t use off-shore workers — focus on helping customers move their goods across the border.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s where the second goal comes in. President Donald Trump’s chaotic trade policy has made customs brokers all the more important, according to Chris Bachinski, CEO of 125-year-old firm GHY International. Bachinski — who is one of Amari’s early adopters — told TechCrunch that many of his own customers don’t even have their own compliance staff. Instead, they look to the brokers like GHY to help figure out how sudden changes in trade policy apply to their goods, especially if they are already in transit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This chaos has led to burnout across the industry, according to Basu. With the employee base tightly regulated, and a <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/customs-brokers/license-examination-notice-examination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">licensing exam pass rate</a> that hovers around 10% to 20%, “it’s a perfect fit for AI,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Experienced people are leaving the industry or taking early retirement,” Basu said. “So we’re pitching ourselves as these extra set of hands that logistics companies can hire or keep alongside the human expertise.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Basu said Amari’s AI agents constantly monitor trade rules and update their reasoning any time there’s a change, making it easier for brokers to help their customers quickly understand any impact. Previously, these kinds of sudden changes required manual research that would slow down brokers’ ability to clear cargo into the country.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amari does this by building its own AI models trained on more than one million documents related to the shipments it’s already helped clear through customs, though Basu said the company has been leveraging off-the-shelf models to date. He noted some customers do opt out of this training, and that Amari anonymizes the data before feeding it to the models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do not sell their data, and we make sure that their data is theirs,” he said. “They’re very serious about these documents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Todd Jackson, a partner at First Round Capital, attributed Amari’s early success to Basu’s willingness to pound the pavement in order to learn what these brokers need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“He’s going to conferences, he’s going to trade shows, [and] the word of mouth starts to get very strong,” Jackson said in an interview. “It’s an old-school industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was at one of these trade shows — the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, to be precise — that one of Basu’s presentations caught Bachinski’s eye. GHY International is not a mom-and-pop, but it’s also not a Fortune 500 like FedEx; Bachinski has been looking for ways to both stay competitive and grow his company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bachinski said the biggest concern amongst GHY employees so far has been job loss. But he’s told them not to worry. He said he expects tech like Amari’s to help GHY grow, and to focus more on the customer relationships and compliance work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s an old industry, and technology is going to shift our industry faster than I think most customs brokers understand,” he said. And with trade now constantly in the spotlight, he said brokers need to be agile. “I make this joke that last year, the first time in history, our families know what we do for a living. Because all of a sudden, custom brokers became very, very important.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But that equation just doesn’t quite stick. In practice, the impact of AI coding tools on open source software has been far more mixed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools have caused as many problems as they have solved, according to industry experts. The easy-to-use and accessible nature of AI coding tools has enabled a flood of bad code that threatens to overwhelm projects. Building new features is easier than ever, but maintaining them is just as hard and threatens to further fragment software ecosystems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is a more complicated story than simple software abundance. Perhaps the predicted, imminent death of the software engineer in this new AI era is premature.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-quality-versus-quantity\">Quality versus quantity</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across the board, projects with open codebases are noticing a decline in the average quality of submissions, likely a result of AI tools lowering barriers to entry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For people who are junior to the VLC codebase, the quality of the merge requests we see is abysmal,” Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.videolan.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the VideoLAN Organization</a> that oversees VLC, said in a recent interview.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kempf is still optimistic about AI coding tools overall but says they’re best “for experienced developers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been similar problems for <a href=\"https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Blender</a>, a 3D modeling tool that has been maintained as open source since 2002. Blender Foundation CEO Francesco Siddi said LLM-assisted contributions typically “wasted reviewers’ time and affected their motivation.” Blender is still developing an official policy for AI coding tools, but Siddi said they are “neither mandated nor recommended for contributors or core developers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flood of merge requests has gotten so bad that open source developers are building new tools to manage it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, developer Mitchell Hashimoto launched a system that would limit GitHub contributions to “vouched” users, effectively closing the open-door policy for open source software. As Hashimoto put it in the announcement, “AI eliminated the natural barrier to entry that let OSS projects trust by default.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same effect has emerged in bug bounty programs, which give outside researchers an open door to report security vulnerabilities. The open source data transfer program cURL recently <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/curls-daniel-stenberg-ai-is-ddosing-open-source-and-fixing-its-bugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">halted its bug bounty program</a> after being overwhelmed by what creator Daniel Stenberg described as “AI slop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the old days, someone actually invested a lot of time [in] the security report,” Stenberg said at a recent conference. “There was a built-in friction, but now there’s no effort at all in doing this. The floodgates are open.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s particularly frustrating because many open source projects are also seeing the benefits of AI coding tools. Kempf says it’s made building new modules for VLC far easier, provided there’s an experienced developer at the helm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can give the model the whole codebase of VLC and say, ‘I’m porting this to a new operating system,’” Kempf said. “It is useful for senior people to write new code, but it’s difficult to manage for people who don’t know what they’re doing.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-competing-priorities\">Competing priorities</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger problem for open source projects is a difference in priorities. Companies like Meta value new code and products, while open source software work focuses more on stability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The problem is different from large companies to open source projects,” Kempf commented. “They get promoted for writing code, not maintaining it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools are also arriving at a moment when software, in general, is particularly fragmented. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Open source investor Konstantin Vinogradov says AI tools are running into a long-standing trend in open source engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On the one hand, we have exponentially growing code base with exponentially growing number of interdependences, And on the other hand, we have number of active maintainers, which is maybe slowly growing, but definitely not keeping up,” Vinogradov said. “With AI, both parts of this equation accelerated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a new way of thinking about AI’s impact on software engineering — one with alarming implications for the industry at large. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you see engineering as the process of producing working software, AI coding makes it easier than ever. But if engineering is really the process of managing software complexity, AI coding tools could make it harder. At the very least, it will take a lot of active planning and work to keep the sprawling complexity in check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Vinogradov, the result is a familiar situation for open source projects: a lot of work to do, and not enough good engineers to do it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI does not increase the number of active, skilled maintainers,” he remarked. “It empowers the good ones, but all the fundamental problems just remain.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

FreeForm declined to disclose the company’s post-financing valuation, which Pitchbook cites as $179 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CEO and cofounder Erik Palitsch said the funding would allow the company to upgrade its current GoldenEye printing system, which uses 18 lasers to fuse metal powders into precision components, to a new version. Dubbed Skyfall, the next iteration of the platform would use hundreds of lasers to produce thousands of kilograms of metal parts each day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the culmination of a vision Palitsch launched in 2018 after developing rocket engines at SpaceX, where they found that industrial machines for printing metal components are expensive, finicky, and not well designed for mass manufacturing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their new company would build its platform from the ground up to achieve higher throughput and flexibility, with an emphasis on active software controls. Palitsch says Freeform’s platform is “AI native,” noting a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/ex-spacex-engineers-land-14m-to-scale-new-method-for-3d-printing-metal/\">partnership with Nvidia</a> that allows the company to access advanced GPUs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we’re the only quote-unquote manufacturing company out there that has H200 clusters in a data center on site,” Paltisch told TechCrunch. “What are they doing? We’re running real-time physics-based simulations and learning all the different aspects of the end to end manufacturing workflow.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The data collected by sensors in the company’s manufacturing platform and during the simulations allows Freeform to rapidly improve production quality and quantity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have more meaningful data on the physics of the metal-printing process than any company in the world,” head of talent Cameron Kay said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Palitsch said he could not disclose any customers, he said the company is already delivering hundreds of “mission-critical” parts to buyers.

The first five to 10 employees will have a massive impact on the company culture, and the precedents set with them are difficult to change down the road. That’s why this season on Build Mode, we’re diving into what it takes to build a world-class founding team.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To kick off season two, Isabelle Johannessen is joined by Yuri Sagalov, managing director at General Catalyst and former founder, YC partner, and seed investor at Wayfinder Ventures. Sagalov has worked with hundreds of pre-seed and seed-stage companies and has seen firsthand the best (and worst) ways to hire in the early days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t\n\t</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this episode, Sagalov offers his best pieces of advice for founders who are hiring their first team, strategically building their cap table, and forming compensation structures that can scale with the company.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-three-types-of-investors-and-which-one-to-avoid\">The three types of investors (and which one to avoid) </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagalov categorizes investors into three main buckets: the ones that are heavily involved and function as an extension of your team, the ones that will give you a check and then vanish, and the micromanagers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first type of investor is the most valuable according to Sagalov: “They’re going to help you with recruiting, hiring, go to market. And the most interesting thing with those investors is often it’s completely disconnected from the check size.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it may feel counterintuitive to turn down investments, working with VCs who will become overly involved in the process may cause more harm than good in the long run. Sagalov said, “The only bucket that I avoid is this third bucket of investors who give you money and they’re kind of in your kitchen, meddling. They have an opinion on everything. They get stressed out when things don’t go right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a fundraise, everyone is putting their best foot forward, so Sagalov suggests reaching out to current portfolio companies before committing to an investor.  “The best thing you can do as a founder is actually talk to portfolio companies, talk to other founders that they’ve worked with, ask for concrete examples of how they’ve been helpful, if they’ve been helpful, and then actually ask how they were when things didn’t go right.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-split-equity-with-a-co-founder\">How to split equity with a co-founder </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an investor, Sagalov looks for co-founders who have created an equity split that is fair but also hedges for future misalignments. He suggests creating a slight differentiation by plus or minus one share so there is a clear way to break deadlocks.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sagalov also reminds early-stage founders that these early decisions have staying power: “Oftentimes founders over-index on ‘I came up with the idea, so I deserve the lion’s share.’  Most of the journey of the company is ahead of them. You don’t want someone waking up five years from now feeling like they put in equal blood, sweat, and tears but own one-fifth of the equity.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talk-to-early-employees-about-risk-and-compensation\">Talk to early employees about risk and compensation </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first few hires should be all in on the startup’s mission. Oftentimes, joining an early-stage startup can be perceived as risky. Sagalov emphasized the importance of discussing the risks and potential benefits: “Fundamentally, what you’re looking for when you’re hiring the first few people are missionaries who, beyond even the compensation, want to join you for the mission of the business,” he said. “You want to be honest with them that there is a lot of risk on the journey.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next week on Build Mode, we’re talking with Sarah Lucena, the founder and CEO of Mappa, who discusses how founders can take compatibility into account and hire the right fit for the team the first time, using their AI tool. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Isabelle Johannessen is our host. Build Mode is produced and edited by Maggie Nye. Audience Development is led by Morgan Little.
