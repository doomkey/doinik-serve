The agency also ordered Zuckerman to delete all the data collected by SpyFone, as well as to undergo frequent audits and establish certain cybersecurity practices for his businesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“SpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,” said Samuel Levine, then acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company’s slipshod security.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2025-0198-0001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In his petition</a>, Zuckerman claimed that the FTC order’s security requirements have made it harder for him to run his other businesses due to financial costs, despite the fact that Support King is no longer in operation and he now only runs a restaurant and plans other “tourism ventures” in Puerto Rico, according to the petition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached via email, Zuckerman declined to comment and referred questions to his lawyer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FTC ban stemmed from an incident in 2018, when <a href=\"http://vice.com/en/article/spyware-company-spyfone-terabytes-data-exposed-online-leak/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a security researcher found an Amazon S3 bucket belonging to SpyFone</a> that left extremely sensitive data — including selfies, text messages, chat app messages, audio recordings, contacts, location, hashed passwords and logins, and more — exposed online for anyone to see and access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exposed data included 44,109 unique email addresses and, according to the researcher who found the breach, “at least 2,208 current ‘customers’ and hundreds or thousands of photos and audio in each folder” from 3,666 phones that had the SpyFone stalkerware installed on them.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about stalkerware makers?

In 2022, TechCrunch received a trove of breached data from stalkerware app SpyTrac. The data revealed that SpyTrac was run by freelance developers with direct ties to Support King, in what appeared to be an attempt to circumvent the FTC’s ban. Furthermore, the breached data included records from SpyFone, which Zuckerman was ordered to delete, and keys to access the cloud storage of OneClickMonitor, another one of his stalkerware apps. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eva Galperin, a prominent expert on stalkerware, celebrated the news. “Mr. Zuckerman was clearly hoping that if he laid low for a few years, everyone would forget about the reasons why the FTC issued a ban not only against the company, but against him specifically,” Galperin told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch’s revelation in 2022 that Zuckerman apparently violated the FTC ban, “suggests that Zuckerman did not learn his lesson,” added Galperin, who is the director of cybersecurity at the digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stalkerware apps allow their customers to surreptitiously spy on the phones and devices of their loved ones. In addition to enabling potentially illegal activities, for the last eight years, there have been at least 26 stalkerware companies that have been hacked or left sensitive data exposed online, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/hacked-leaked-exposed-why-you-should-stop-using-stalkerware-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to TechCrunch’s tally</a>. These repeated incidents show these companies have repeatedly failed to protect the privacy of their customers, as well as the people they spy on.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Skild didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. SoftBank and Nvidia declined to comment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike other heavily funded startups, Skild AI is not building proprietary hardware. Instead, it’s developing a robot-agnostic foundation model that can be customized for various types of robots and use cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company unveiled its general-purpose robot model Skild Brain in July with videos showing robots picking up dishes and climbing up and down the stairs. The company has secured strategic partnerships with LG CNS and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to develop its ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investor interest in AI robotics has been steadily growing. Physical Intelligence, another company developing “brains” for a broad range of robots, has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-20/robotics-startup-physical-intelligence-valued-at-5-6-billion-in-new-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> recently raised $600 million at a $5.6 billion valuation led by CapitalG. One investor who evaluated but declined to fund Physical Intelligence told TechCrunch that its model is still in the early stages of development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, Figure, a company developing a humanoid robot, raised more than $1 billion at a massive <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">$39 billion valuation</a>.

Now, we have a firmer grasp on those weekly ride numbers, thanks to a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management to it investors that was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/tiger-global-new-fund-ai-valuations.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported by CNBC</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter was an appeal for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/tiger-global-plans-cautious-venture-future-with-a-new-2-2b-fund/\">investment into Tiger Global’s next venture capital fund</a> and called out the gains, so far, of its current fund. Those gains rested largely on its investments in hot companies like OpenAI, Databricks, and Waymo. In the letter, Tiger disclosed that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week — nearly double the amount it disclosed this spring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That number will rise as the company continues its aggressive rollout strategy, too. Waymo, which provides commercial robotaxi service in five cities, has announced plans to launch in 12 additional cities in 2026, including Dallas, Denver, Houston, Nashville, and San Diego.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Waymo spokesperson declined to comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The U.S. will take a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/08/trump-nvidia-h200-sales-china.html\">25% cut of these sales</a>, CNBC reported. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">H200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-could-approve-h200-exports-134428252.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VtYWZvci5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHQRzQWH648Ene_VMBSBfOA1fid50bu8Hb3ALtkTEIKdeKv-s6Si4ir5zNsapSNBc-YgZMpPmPWWntJoCduvgnYdADn9-1qOV5PvMopSq_YBi8D2gaJ4H1CK3dPGSlb0tgkE8WhnjFwugX1FV5uFst-wv7A2AzcC7lZ1ny9Ei7Ha\">was in President Donald Trump’s hands</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e4e4799-b340-4cee-bdbc-6a6325f77eac\">block the export of advanced AI chips</a> to China for more than two years.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It’s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration hit chip companies like Nvidia with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/\">licensing requirements</a> to send their chips to China in April before it formally <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/trump-administration-officially-rescinds-bidens-ai-diffusion-rules/\">rescinded a Biden administration diffusion rule</a> that would have regulated AI chip exports in May. Over the summer, the U.S. government signaled that companies would be able to start sending chips to China as long as the government got a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd1a0729-a8ab-41e1-a4d2-8907f4c01cac\">15% cut of all revenue</a>, as chips became a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/nvidias-resumption-of-h20-chip-sales-related-to-rare-earth-element-trade-talks/\">bargaining tool</a> in trade talks with China.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, by that point, the market for U.S.-developed chips in China was strained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September, China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/china-tells-its-tech-companies-they-cant-buy-ai-chips-from-nvidia/\">banned domestic companies</a> from buying Nvidia’s chips, leaving companies in the country to rely on less advanced domestic chips from Alibaba and Huawei.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, Trump said that Chinese president Xi Jinping “responded positively” to the latest H200 news in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115686072737425841\">Truth Social post</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated on December 8 when the proposed decision was confirmed. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction.

Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Lucid and will update the article if the company comments on the lawsuit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors’ press release from that day only said he had “departed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors. The company is burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV. It is developing more affordable mass-market vehicles on a midsized platform slated to debut sometime in late 2026.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid has also been churning through executives. The company’s VP of engineering left on the same day Bach claims to have been fired, as TechCrunch previously reported. Former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February, and the company has still not named a permanent replacement. Lucid’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing all left within the last year, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bach, in the complaint, claims to have been ascendant before the internal investigation. An engineer who spent a decade with the company, Bach says he oversaw “all hardware engineering,” “product management and corporate planning.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bach states that Lucid’s chairman Turqi Alnowaiser “praised Bach’s loyalty and dedication to the Company and expressed a desire to continue working with Bach.” He also claims board member Andrew Liveris “signaled that Bach would become Chief Technology Officer (the position ‘is yours to lose’) and that Bach could one day become Chief Executive Officer,” according to the complaint.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The workplace culture investigation launched in late 2024, which Bach claims was “tainted by HR’s racist beliefs,” “initially resulted in Bach losing significant responsibilities.” The HR department told Bach at the time that he contributed to a poor culture at the company, according to the complaint. In addition to losing oversight of the powertrain team, Bach claims to have been excluded from board meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/tiger-global-hit-by-17b-hedge-fund-losses-has-nearly-depleted-its-latest-vc-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch reported</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/tiger-global-secondaries-direct-stakes-sales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">315 startups</a>, according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratcheted up valuations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When interest rates rose, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/a-new-disclosure-shows-again-how-badly-tigers-pray-and-spray-fund-performed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">party was over, and startups spent years</a> trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/26/2025-will-likely-be-another-brutal-year-of-failed-startups-data-suggests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">many shuttering along the way</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/03/john-curtius-is-leaving-tiger-global-to-start-his-own-venture-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">left to start his own fund</a>, and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/21/tiger-global-chieftain-scott-shleifer-transitions-to-advisory-role-after-wild-ride/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transitioned to an advisory role</a>, while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tiger Global went on to raise a much smaller PIP 16 fund of $2.2 billion in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-01/tiger-global-vc-fund-closes-63-below-target-with-2-2-billion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reported</a> at the time, which is, admittedly, still an enormous fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, on the strength of PIP 16’s blockbuster AI investments, Tiger Global is raising Fund 17. PIP 16 holds stakes in OpenAI, Waymo and Databricks, all of which have had skyrocketing valuations and driven this fund’s paper gains by 33% so far, the letter said as reported by CNBC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, in a nod to the need for more caution than in previous years, the letter promised a more targeted approach. It acknowledged that leaning into AI investments could be risky and require “humility” because “valuations are elevated and, in our view, sometimes unsupported by company fundamentals,” according to CNBC. (Tiger Global could not be immediately reached for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, even as Tiger Global raises a fresh fund to go after more big AI opportunities, it’s implying that the AI market is in a bubble, and it doesn’t want to drive valuations to even higher, perhaps unrealistic, heights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on <a href=\"https://claude.com/blog/claude-and-slack?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anthropic’s existing Slack integration</a> by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Slack, positioning itself as an “<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dreamforce-2025s-bombshell-ted-elliott-rz3tc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">agentic hub</a>” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic. The AI coding market is getting more competitive, and differentiation is starting to depend more on integration depth and distribution than model capability alone.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the integration raises questions about code security and IP protection, as it adds another platform through which sensitive repository access must be managed and audited — while also introducing new dependencies where outages or rate limits in either Slack or Claude’s API could disrupt development workflows that teams previously controlled locally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and Slack for more information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model.

For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it’ll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent’s model doesn’t have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI browser makers are also paying attention to security.

Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/openai-and-the-race-for-ai-driven-commerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">build apps into ChatGPT</a>. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/target-joins-openais-growing-list-of-retail-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/intuit-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Intuit</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/openai-and-perplexity-are-launching-ai-shopping-assistants-but-competing-startups-arent-sweating-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI and Perplexity</a> announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/adobe-predicts-ai-assisted-online-shopping-to-grow-520-during-the-2025-u-s-holiday-season/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-assisted online shopping</a> will grow by 520% this holiday season.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/26/is-openai-profitable-forecast-data-center-200-billion-shortfall-hsbc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it may not</a> for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/\">small fee</a>” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI’s debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

California, for example, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/california-governor-newsom-signs-landmark-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/\">the AI safety and transparency bill SB 53</a>, while Tennessee’s <a href=\"https://www.lw.com/admin/upload/SiteAttachments/The-ELVIS-Act-Tennessee-Shakes-Up-Its-Right-of-Publicity-Law-and-Takes-On-Generative-AI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ELVIS Act</a> protects musicians and performers from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes of their voices and likenesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silicon Valley figures, including OpenAI President Greg Brockman and VC-turned-White House “AI czar” David Sacks, have argued that such laws by states would create an unworkable patchwork of laws that would stifle innovation and threaten the U.S.’s lead against China in the race to develop AI technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silicon Valley has a mighty lobbying arm that has blocked meaningful technology regulation for years, and proponents of states’ regulatory rights say there’s no reason to believe state AI laws could “destroy AI progress,” as VCs and tech companies claim. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s executive order, a <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26287992/trump-executive-order-on-ai-law-preemption.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">draft</a> of which was leaked a couple of weeks ago, would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” to challenge state AI laws in court, direct agencies to evaluate state laws deemed “onerous,” and push the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission toward national standards that override state rules. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Order would also give Sacks direct influence over AI policy, superseding the usual role of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, currently headed by Michael Kratsios. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Christmas comes early for AI billionaires who keep getting exactly what they want from The White House: a massive handout that makes it that much easier for them to make massive profits for themselves with exactly zero consideration for the risks to our kids, to our safety, and to our jobs,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/a16z-backed-super-pac-is-targeting-alex-bores-sponsor-of-new-yorks-ai-safety-bill-he-says-bring-it-on/\">New York Assembly member Alex Bores</a>, who sponsored New York’s RAISE Act, said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Attempts to block states’ power to regulate AI have been deeply unpopular on both sides of Congress. Earlier this year, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a proposal that would place a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/\">10-year moratorium</a> on AI legislation into the federal budget bill, but it was rejected 99-1, in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement that tech companies shouldn’t operate without oversight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And when Trump’s draft was leaked last month, several Republican politicians spoke out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1991487762722353228\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted on X</a>: “States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state. Federalism must be preserved.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) <a href=\"https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1996630484512821505\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted</a> late last week: “I oppose stripping Florida of our ability to legislate in the best interest of the people. A ten year AI moratorium bans state regulation of AI, which would prevent FL from enacting important protections for individuals, children and families.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeSantis has also called data centers as drains on power and water resources, as well as potential job killers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,” he said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1990850245832683816\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">November X post</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Late last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) warned Trump against the EO, advising him to “leave AI to the states” to preserve federalism and allow local protections. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The desire to protect people from potential harms of AI technology is not unfounded. There have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">several deaths by suicide</a> following prolonged conversations with AI chatbots, and psychologists have recorded an uptick in cases of a condition they’re calling “AI psychosis.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A bipartisan coalition of<a href=\"https://ncdoj.sharefile.com/share/view/s70df95275fdb4755bf463e6ae62d82c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> over 35 state attorneys general</a> warned Congress last month that overriding state AI laws could have “disastrous consequences,” and more than <a href=\"https://ari.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NDAA-State-Policymaker-Coalition-Letter-11-23-25-Oppose-AI-Preemption.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">200 state lawmakers</a> have issued an open letter opposing federal preemption, citing setbacks to progress on AI safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated with comment from Alex Bores (D-NY).</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073301\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Hinge</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Convo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/hinge-new-ai-feature-determines-if-your-prompt-response-is-too-basic/\">Prompt Feedback</a> feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-14/gen-z-s-skeptical-of-ai-in-dating-apps-like-tinder-and-hinge-survey-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> Bloomberg Intelligence survey </a>found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million toward AI efforts. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-declares-code-red-combat-threats-chatgpt-delays-ads-effort\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“code red” memo</a> about the competitive threat of Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per <a href=\"https://ramp.com/data/ai-index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ramp AI Index</a>, the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/anthropic-expects-b2b-demand-to-boost-revenue-to-70b-in-2028-report/\">revenue</a> comes mainly from B2B sales — and, increasingly, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/open-source-technology-in-the-age-of-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open-weight model providers</a> for enterprise customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI giant has committed <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/28/openai-1-trillion-altman?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$1.4 trillion</a> to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That increase in reasoning tokens, which correlates with increased <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/05/ai-reasoning-energy-problem-data-centers-30-times-more-power/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">energy usage</a>, could be expensive for companies and therefore not sustainable in the long term. TechCrunch has asked OpenAI about enterprise budget allocation for AI and the sustainability of this growth rate. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073657\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png 1616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=768,304 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=680,269 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=1200,475 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=1280,507 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=430,170 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=720,285 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=900,356 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=800,317 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=1536,608 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=668,265 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=1440,570 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=708,280 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond raw usage metrics, OpenAI is also seeing changes in how companies deploy its tools. Use of custom GPTs — which companies use to codify institutional knowledge into assistants or automate workflows —  jumped 19x this year, now accounting for 20% of enterprise messages, the report found. OpenAI pointed to digital bank customer BBVA, which it says regularly uses over 4,000 custom GPTs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It shows you how much people are really able to take this powerful technology and start to customize it to the things that are useful to them,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, during the briefing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These integrations have led to meaningful time savings, according to OpenAI. Participants reported saving 40 to 60 minutes per day with OpenAI’s enterprise products — though that may not include time spent learning the systems, prompting, or correcting AI output. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The report found that enterprise workers are also increasingly leveraging AI tools to expand their own capabilities. Three quarters of those surveyed say AI enables them to do things, including technical tasks, they couldn’t do before. OpenAI reported a 36% increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research teams. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI drove home the idea that its technology is democratizing access to skills, it’s important to note that more vibe coding could lead to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/wiz-chief-technologist-ami-luttwak-on-how-ai-is-transforming-cyberattacks/\">more security vulnerabilities</a> and other flaws. When asked about this, Lightcap pointed to OpenAI’s recent release of its agentic security researcher <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-aardvark/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Aardvark</a>, which is in private beta, as a potential way to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073656\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png 1606w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=1200,601 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=1280,641 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=720,360 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=900,451 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=800,400 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=1536,769 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=668,334 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=1232,617 1232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=708,354 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The gaps are widest between frontier and median workers for writing, coding, and analysis</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s report also found that even the most active ChatGPT Enterprise users aren’t using the most advanced tools available to them, like data analysis, reasoning, or search. During the briefing, Lightcap mused that this was because fully adopting AI systems requires a mindset shift and deeper integration with enterprise data and processes. Adoption of advanced features will take time, he said, as companies retool workflows to better understand what’s possible. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightcap and Chatterji also stressed a report finding that showed a “growing divide in AI adoption,” with some “frontier” workers using more tools more often to save more time than the “laggards.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are firms that still very much see these systems as a piece of software, something I can buy and give to my teams and that’s kind of the end of it,” Lightcap said. “And then there are companies that are really starting to embrace it, almost more like an operating system. It’s basically a re-platforming of a lot of the company’s operations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s leadership — which certainly feels the pressure of the firm’s $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments — framed this as an opportunity for laggards to catch up. For workers training AI systems to replicate their work, “catching up” might feel more like a countdown.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
