That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-launching-its-own-ai-infrastructure-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said that</a> Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spend billions to expand its AI capacity</a>. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/ai-data-centers-accused-creating-160043558.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">accused</a> of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/data-center-water-pollution-amazon-oregon-1235466613/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">environmental concerns</a>. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/nx-s1-5355017/data-centers-bring-money-to-small-towns-but-do-they-also-bring-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">questions around</a> the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">observed</a> that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company <a href=\"https://www.wisn.com/article/microsoft-drops-caledonia-data-center-after-community-pushback/68905827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">abandoned plans</a> for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township <a href=\"https://arcwestmichigan.com/news/local/microsoft-data-center-proposal-protest-processing-information-farm-life-community-dorr-township-allegan-county-west-michigan-infrastructure-development?photo=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have recently inspired locals</a> to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ohio-public-pays-price-big-093003806.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an op-ed</a> in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/communities/americas/ohio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">developing</a> several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-microsoft-make-changes-curb-data-center-power-costs-americans-2026-01-13/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">major changes</a>” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/trump-and-microsoft-laud-data-center-commitments-as-key-to-addressing-electricity-prices-3961528c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqd6_IWdHe0kYQxoYNNXC8LJ6OhCRB1wooYoTn3g0mEr5jkfi-TPWnfCGJ4il3o%3D&amp;gaa_ts=696693bf&amp;gaa_sig=J5QMFBFOx4fuMfYlhc-Qz7ayNiiB1exUqCNVBwv49p1En7-QYRza3SWBl7M-STYc1__FRng2NKm8Uuo3mMeOhQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trump said</a> the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank <a href=\"https://groundworkcollaborative.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Groundwork Collaborative</a>. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as <a href=\"https://x.com/owenslindsay1/status/2010764260423729309\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">well as delving into some</a> of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which <a href=\"https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/message-ceo/nrf-2026-remarks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google CEO Sundar Pichai described</a> when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a post on X, Google <a href=\"https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010852970859270341\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">responded that</a>, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents <a href=\"https://ucp.dev/specification/identity-linking/#mapping-between-resources-actions-and-capabilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on handling a shopper’s identity</a> say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">Google to change a number of search business practices</a> after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like <a href=\"https://dupe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dupe</a>, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and <a href=\"https://www.joinbeni.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Beni</a>, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Without it, crops would go unfertilized and billions of people would starve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans started making ammonia in large amounts just over a century ago, and since then the process used to make it, known as Haber-Bosch, hasn’t changed much. A new startup, <a href=\"https://www.ammobia.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ammobia</a>, says that it has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process to lower the cost by up to 40%.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To prove the technology works on a larger scale, Ammobia has raised a $7.5 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Investors include Air Liquide’s venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, MOL Switch, and Shell Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the startup succeeds, it could pave the way for ammonia to be used beyond fertilizer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammonia is viewed by some as an alternative to hydrogen to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/amogy-raises-80m-to-power-ships-and-data-centers-with-ammonia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decarbonize a range of industries</a>. Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/business/petrochemicals/ammonia-fuel-future/99/i8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as energy dense</a> and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH<sub>4</sub>) found in natural gas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate <a href=\"https://www.c-thru.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ammonia-Technical-Brief-June2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">between 1,000 and 3,000 tons</a> per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250270101A1/en?assignee=Ammobia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">patent pending</a> on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.5c00899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">manganese nitride</a>, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/amazons-ring-doorbells-get-fire-alerts-an-app-store-and-new-sensors/\">shipped</a> just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/amazons-new-alexa-feature-adds-conversational-ai-to-ring-doorbells/\">conversational AI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">facial recognition</a> features, and more. Some of these additions have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">not been without controversy</a>, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2023, five years after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/amazon-is-buying-smart-doorbell-maker-ring/\">selling Ring to Amazon</a>, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/amazon-ring-ceo-steps-down-five-years-after-acquisition.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">needed out</a>. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082346\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg 3777w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ring-watch-duty-jamie-siminoff-garage-burned-palisades-fire-la-2026-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">destroying the garage where Ring was built</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of Ring’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/amazons-ring-doorbells-get-fire-alerts-an-app-store-and-new-sensors/\">new additions, Fire Watch</a>, was inspired by this tragedy.

In 2024, Ring <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/ring-will-stop-sharing-video-with-police-with-some-exceptions-heres-what-it-means-for-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ended</a> an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/security/amazons-ring-cameras-push-deeper-into-police-and-government-surveillance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">companies like Flock Safety and Axon,</a> which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/19/tech/flock-safety-ai-cameras-brown-suspect-privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">surveillance cameras</a> — including <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/police-seek-ring-camera-footage-004651394.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADdUEbMhvFgfmptcTLAaYr5nRw16XsVvPa9ebjQzrL0C_i4TF_DushY0t0v_EIxsSWh4iWHOe4mwy4py6KriCn9JZo4QT8xhPuIeSRvwBJ2hjyUBgVJIe71eKiysAs0UENx9q1DyOYD-xxCI0WaMKvKGtRwgyso5aaeg58Og-XqH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ring’s</a>, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">there are</a> still <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">worries</a> about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country.

This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082347\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg 4234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=322,430 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0543.jpg?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/852890/ring-mobile-security-elite-camera-ces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mounted cameras</a>, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2026/ring-around-the-parking-lot-amazons-security-tech-goes-commercial-with-a-5k-surveillance-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">trailer</a>, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For the security-minded, this raises immediate red flags. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of a sudden there’s medical data transferring from HIPAA-compliant organizations to non-HIPAA-compliant vendors,” Itai Schwartz, co-founder of data loss prevention firm MIND, told TechCrunch. “So I’m curious to see how the regulators would approach this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the way some industry professionals see it, the cat is already out of the bag. Now, instead of Googling cold symptoms, people are talking to AI chatbots — over <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">230 million people</a> already talk to ChatGPT about their health each week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This was one of the biggest use cases of ChatGPT,” Andrew Brackin, a partner at Gradient who invests in health tech, told TechCrunch. “So it makes a lot of sense that they would want to build a more kind of private, secure, optimized version of ChatGPT for these healthcare questions.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI chatbots have a persistent problem with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\">hallucinations</a>, a particularly sensitive issue in healthcare. According to Vectara’s <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/vectara/leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Factual Consistency Evaluation Model</a>, OpenAI’s GPT-5 is more prone to hallucinations than many Google and Anthropic models. But AI companies see the potential to rectify inefficiencies in the healthcare space (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/\">Anthropic</a> also announced a health product this week).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Dr. Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, the inability of American patients to access care is more urgent than the threat of ChatGPT dispensing poor advice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Right now, you go to any health system and you want to meet the primary care doctor — the wait time will be three to six months,” Dr. Shah said. “If your choice is to wait six months for a real doctor, or talk to something that is not a doctor but can do some things for you, which would you pick?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dr. Shah thinks a clearer route to introduce AI into healthcare systems comes on the provider side, rather than the patient side. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Medical journals have <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2016-09-08-study-physicians-spend-nearly-twice-much-time-ehrdesk-work-patients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">often</a> <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/pubs/fpm/issues/2023/0700/relieving-admin-burden.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that administrative tasks can consume about half of a primary care physician’s time, which slashes the number of patients they can see in a given day. If that kind of work could be automated, doctors would be able to see more patients, perhaps reducing the need for people to use tools like ChatGPT Health without additional input from a real doctor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dr. Shah leads a team at Stanford that is developing <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/ai/stanford-pilots-chatehr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChatEHR</a>, a software that is built into the electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing clinicians to interact with a patient’s medical records in a more streamlined, efficient manner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Making the electronic medical record more user friendly means physicians can spend less time scouring every nook and cranny of it for the information they need,” Dr. Sneha Jain, an early tester of ChatEHR, said in a Stanford Medicine <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/06/chatehr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">article</a>. “ChatEHR can help them get that information up front so they can spend time on what matters — talking to patients and figuring out what’s going on.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is also working on AI products that can be used on the clinician and insurer sides, rather than just its public-facing Claude chatbot. This week, Anthropic announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/\">Claude for Healthcare</a> by explaining how it could be used to reduce the time spent on tedious administrative tasks, like submitting prior authorization requests to insurance providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some of you see hundreds, thousands of these prior authorization cases a week,” said Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger in a recent presentation at J.P. Morgan’s <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/about-us/events-conferences/health-care-conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Healthcare Conference</a>. “So imagine cutting 20, 30 minutes out of each of them — it’s a dramatic time savings.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI and medicine become more intertwined, there’s an inescapable tension between the two worlds — a doctor’s primary incentive is to help their patients, while tech companies are ultimately accountable to their shareholders, even if their intentions are noble.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that tension is an important one,” Dr. Bari said. “Patients rely on us to be cynical and conservative in order to protect them.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The video allows Neo robots to learn new tasks they weren’t previously trained on, according to 1X.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This release comes as 1X is gearing up to release its Neo humanoids into the home. The company opened up <a href=\"https://www.1x.tech/neo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">preorders for its humanoids</a> in October with plans to ship the bots this year. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After years of developing our world model and making Neo’s design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. “With the ability to transform any prompt into new actions — even without prior examples — this marks the starting point of Neo’s ability to teach itself to master nearly anything you could think to ask.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saying that the bot can transform <em>any prompt</em> into a new action is a lofty claim and not entirely accurate; you can’t tell a Neo to drive a car and it will suddenly know how to parallel park, for instance. But there is some learning going on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">1X isn’t saying the world model allows today’s Neo bots to do a new task right away from capturing video and being prompted, a company spokesperson clarified. Instead, the bot takes video data linked to specific prompts and then sends that back into the world model. That model is then fed back into the network of bots to give them a better understanding of the physical world and more know-how. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also gives users insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt. That kind of behavioral information could help 1X train these models to a point where robots will be able to react to a prompt of something they’ve never done before.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These companies have also hired armies of delivery personnel as competition heats up in the country’s booming e-commerce space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pressure on workers has intensified as the sector has grown. On New Year’s Eve, more than 200,000 gig workers staged protests across major Indian cities during the peak delivery period, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3339617/gig-workers-strike-india-spurs-debate-human-cost-delivery-race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the South China Morning Post</a>, citing the Indian Federation of App Based Transport Workers. The workers demanded legislative protection, social security benefits, better wages, and changes to automated penalty systems that reduce their ratings for late deliveries. Safety concerns have emerged around workers rushing through traffic to meet delivery deadlines. “Ultra-fast delivery models of 10-15 minutes materially change the risk and stress profile of gig work,” Prabir Jha, founder and CEO of the HR consultancy Prabir Jha People Advisory, told the outlet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid the worker protests and pressure from the labor ministry, Blinkit has removed messaging that promised deliveries within 10 minutes, and its rivals are also expected to follow suit, Bloomberg said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes little more than a month after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/indias-gig-workers-win-legal-status-but-access-to-social-security-remains-elusive/\">India granted legal status</a> to millions of gig and platform workers under new labor laws that define gig and platform workers in statute, and require aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1% to 2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s gig economy employed about 7.7 million workers in 2020-21 and is projected to reach 23.5 million by 2029-30, according to government think tank NITI Aayog.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swiggy, Blinkit, and Zepto did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, <a href=\"https://deepgram.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Deepgram</a> said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s raise continues the trend of sizable funding rounds in voice AI last year, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/sesame-the-conversational-ai-startup-from-oculus-founders-raises-250m-and-launches-beta/\">Sesame’s $250 million Series B</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elevenlabs-raises-180-million-in-series-c-funding-at-3-3-billion-valuation/\">ElevenLab’s $180 million Series C</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/paris-based-ai-voice-startup-gradium-nabs-70m-seed/\">Gradium’s $70 million seed round</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In 2024, when we were talking to enterprises about how they were thinking about using AI inside their business, we started to hear about them using voice AI in processes like contact centers and sales developments. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that’s what led us to them [Deepgram],” de Saint-Aignan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She noted that voice AI could help in making customers’ interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deepgram has a bunch of models related to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/deepgrams-aura-gives-ai-agents-a-voice/\">text-to-speech</a> and speech-to-text, along with platforms and APIs for conversational speech recognition and interruption handling with low latency. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s CEO, Scott Stephenson, said that the company didn’t need the fundraise and it was cashflow positive last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. We see that we can make larger investment sooner in order to accelerate growth. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We weren’t out looking for a raise, though. We had multiple people coming to us. We wanted strategic investors who understand voice AI and the technical intricacies of it and have relationships with companies building using the technology.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company wants to use the new fundraising to expand its global footprint and better support multiple languages. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y Combinator-backed OfOne, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick-service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">withdrew its voice AI experiment</a> after a person ordered 18,000 water cups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. There have been a lot of sour interactions with voice AI over the last 20 years, where a lot of assistants have come out, and people felt that those didn’t provide a magical experience. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne’s acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl’s Jr., picked up <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260108472215/en/Presto-Adds-%2410M-to-Accelerate-AI-Leadership-for-Enterprise-QSR-Brands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$10 million in new funding</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://market.us/report/voice-ai-agents-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Analysts’ </a><a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-voice-generators-market-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> peg the voice market to grow at over 30% year-over-year and become a $14-$20 billion market by 2030. With this growth rate, model and API providers will look to be multibillion-dollar companies by becoming a core component for enterprises and startups developing voice solutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Slackbot, the automated assistant baked into the Salesforce-owned corporate messaging platform Slack, is entering a new era as an AI agent. And Salesforce CTO Parker Harris hopes it will be as viral as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cloud software giant rolled out the new version of Slackbot on Tuesday. This new AI agent version of Slackbot, which is generally available for Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, can find information, draft emails, and schedule meetings, among other things, all within the Slack platform, according to the company. It can also connect to, and interact with, other enterprise products like Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to find information if it’s granted permission. This allows users to work across a handful of different common enterprise applications without leaving Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce, and its enterprise software competitors, are pouring resources into the development of AI products in a bid to preserve, and even grow, their market share. The remodeled Slackbot, which was originally announced at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/salesforce-announces-agentforce-360-as-enterprise-ai-competition-heats-up/\">Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference</a> in October, is just one piece of Salesforce’s enterprise AI-heavy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/salesforce-announces-agentforce-360-as-enterprise-ai-competition-heats-up/\">product plan</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harris told TechCrunch the next-gen Slackbot is completely different than what existed before; the company kept the name because it is already well known.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harris added that Slack doesn’t generally release new features. Instead, Slack typically issues updates to the product to help drive adoption, which makes Slackbot quite different from past product updates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is an agent, it is a super agent that is your employee agent,” Harris said. “It’s powered by generative AI, and it is something that is highly crafted and highly curated to be an agentic experience that employees and users love.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce tests new products, like Slackbot, with its employees for months before they release them — Harris joked they like to drink their own champagne first. Slackbot has been the most adopted internal tool they’ve released, he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just seeing the sheer active user count is a great sign we have hit on product-market-fit,” Harris said about internal adoption. “Adopted, not mandated, in corporations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is just the beginning of Slackbot’s second bloom as an AI agent, Harris said. In the future, they want Slackbot to move beyond just a text-based agent only in Slack. He said they want to add voice capabilities in the future and the ability for Slackbot to browse the internet alongside its users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I am very confident that investing in Slackbot is not only good for Slack, it will be incredibly good for the entire company,” Harris said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company’s software uses computer vision to track bird movement and migration patterns, minimizing damage from wind turbines on local bird populations. This benefits both biodiversity and wind farm developers, which face strict regulations around their impact on birds — regulations that can delay construction or even shut down projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Webb and co-founder and managing director Tom Quigley described their introduction as “kismet” to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/13/superorganism-wants-to-be-the-conservationist-on-the-cap-table/\">TechCrunch back in 2023</a>. Webb had begun making angel investments focused on biodiversity to see if it could be viable as a venture capital fund strategy. While he was doing this, he reached out to Quigley because he was impressed with his background. The two started talking and eventually began working on the firm in 2022.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The political climate around protecting nature and the climate in general has changed a lot — in the U.S. at least — since the pair started working on this a few years ago. But it didn’t really hold the firm back from reaching its $25 million target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quigley said some potential LPs needed guidance in understanding what makes Superorganism different than a climate fund, but that becomes clearer when you look at the firm’s portfolio, he said. Their portfolio companies span different categories and attract different types of follow-on investors and customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are purposely building a diverse portfolio,” Quigley said. “It allows us to show what the best biodiversity companies look like across all industries, across all tech types. We think that there’s a showcase portfolio for a fund — one that’s a really powerful thing, and it’s a really stable portfolio that’s not too [affected] by different headwinds in different industries or different government policies of the day.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of these biodiversity issues transcend partisan battles over climate change too, he said. Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis recently gave a shout out to <a href=\"https://www.inversaleathers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Inversa</a>, one of Superorganism’s portfolio companies that <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/governor-ron-desantis-highlights-success-everglades-python-removal-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turns invasive species into leather goods</a>, for helping tackle a python problem in the Everglades, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thus far, the firm has invested in 20 companies and plans for a portfolio size of about 35 companies for this fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We recognize that we’re the first and we need to be there to sort of bring others along where they might be interested in taking their first bet on biodiversity, helping them find and support the right ones that can move the needle,” Quigley said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If the EU finds Meta in breach of its antitrust rules, it could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has told AI providers that they can continue offering their AI chatbots to users in Italy even after the new rules go into force on January 15, according to a notice to developers seen by TechCrunch.

More <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/the-next-normal/biotech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">than 200 startups</a> are now competing to weave AI directly into research workflows, attracting growing interest from investors. <a href=\"https://converge-bio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Converge Bio</a> is the latest company to ride that shift, securing new capital as competition in the AI-driven drug discovery space heats up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Boston- and Tel Aviv-based startup, which helps pharma and biotech companies develop drugs faster using generative AI trained on molecular data, has raised a $25 million oversubscribed Series A round, led by Bessemer Venture Partners. TLV Partners, Saras Capital, and Vintage Investment Partners also joined the round, along with additional backing from unidentified executives at Meta, OpenAI, and Wiz.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, Converge trains generative models on DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, then plugs them into pharma and biotech’s workflows to speed up drug development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The drug-development lifecycle has defined stages — from target identification and discovery to manufacturing, clinical trials, and beyond — and within each, there are experiments we can support,” Converge Bio CEO and co-founder Dov Gertz said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. “Our platform continues to expand across these stages, helping bring new drugs to market faster.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Converge has rolled out customer-facing systems. The startup has already introduced three discrete AI systems: one for antibody design, one for protein yield optimization, and one for biomarker and target discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Take our antibody design system as an example. It’s not just a single model. It’s made up of three integrated components. First, a generative model creates novel antibodies. Next, predictive models filter those antibodies based on their molecular properties. Finally, a docking system, which uses a physics-based model, simulates the three-dimensional interactions between the antibody and its target,” Gertz continued. The value lies in the system as a whole, not any single model, according to the CEO. “Our customers don’t have to piece models together themselves. They get ready-to-use systems that plug directly into their workflows.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding comes about a year and a half after the company raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/converge-bios-everything-store-for-biotech-llms-brings-in-5-5m-seed/\">$5.5 million seed</a> round in 2024.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the two-year-old startup has scaled quickly. Converge has completed over 40 programs with more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotech customers, Gertz said. It works with customers across the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Israel and is now expanding into Asia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team has also grown rapidly, increasing to 34 employees from just nine in November 2024. Along the way, Converge has begun publishing public case studies. In one, the startup helped a partner boost protein yield by 4 to 4.5X in a single computational iteration. In another, the platform generated antibodies with extremely high binding affinity, reaching the single-nanomolar range, Gertz noted.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081729\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg 3707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Converge Bio</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-driven drug discovery is experiencing a surge of interest. <a href=\"https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-partners-nvidia-build-industrys-most-powerful-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Last year</a>, Eli Lilly teamed up with Nvidia to build what the companies called the pharma industry’s most powerful supercomputer for drug discovery. And in October 2024, the developers behind <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/blog/demis-hassabis-john-jumper-awarded-nobel-prize-in-chemistry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold project won a Nobel Prize</a> in Chemistry for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that can predict protein structures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked about the momentum and how it is shaping Converge Bio’s growth, Gertz said that the company is witnessing the largest financial opportunity in the history of life sciences and the industry is shifting from “trial-and-error” approaches to data-driven molecular design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We feel the momentum deeply, especially in our inboxes. A year and a half ago, when we founded the company, there was a lot of skepticism,” Gertz told TechCrunch. That skepticism has vanished remarkably quickly, thanks to successful case studies from companies like Converge and from academia, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large language models are gaining attention in drug discovery for their ability to analyze biological sequences and suggest new molecules, but challenges like hallucinations and accuracy remain. “In text, hallucinations are usually easy to spot,” the CEO said. “In molecules, validating a novel compound can take weeks, so the cost is much higher.” To tackle this, Converge pairs generative models with predictive ones, filtering new molecules to reduce risk and improve outcomes for its partners. “This filtration isn’t perfect, but it significantly reduces risk and delivers better outcomes for our customers,” Gertz added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch also asked about experts like Yann LeCun, who remain <a href=\"https://x.com/ylecun/status/1911604721267114206\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">skeptical about using LLMs</a>. “I’m a huge fan of Yann LeCun, and I completely agree with him. We don’t rely on text-based models for core scientific understanding. To truly understand biology, models need to be trained on DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules,” Gertz explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Text-based LLMs are used only as support tools, for example, to help customers navigate literature on generated molecules. “They’re not our core technology,” Gertz said. “We’re not tied to a single architecture. We use LLMs, diffusion models, traditional machine learning, and statistical methods when it makes sense.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our vision is that every life-science organization will use Converge Bio as its generative AI lab. Wet labs will always exist, but they’ll be paired with generative labs that create hypotheses and molecules computationally. We want to be that generative lab for the entire industry,” Gertz said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>The article has been updated to include information on the number of customers</em>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Justin Kim, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://hupo.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Hupo</a>, first launched his company about four years ago, it wasn’t selling AI-powered sales coaching to banks, finance services, or insurance companies. The company originally began as Ami, a mental wellness platform focused on how people manage pressure, form habits, and change behavior over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve always been a big sports fan — basketball, football, Formula One, MMA — and what draws me to all of them is performance. In my free time, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what actually drives human performance. People are very different, but across sports, there are clear patterns in how performance shows up,” Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His curiosity eventually shaped his professional focus. Kim started exploring what drives performance at work, and one theme kept surfacing: mental resilience. That idea led him to found a startup in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early work with Meta, which backed this startup in the seed round, helped sharpen some hard-earned lessons: Software only works when it fits into daily behavior like how people already live and work, and tools designed to help people “improve” often fail if they are judgmental, abstract, or disconnected from real work, Kim told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those ideas followed the startup through its pivot, and today they shape Hupo’s approach to sales coaching; less about replacing human judgment and more about helping people in the moments that really matter in banking, insurance, and financial services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kim said the shift wasn’t as dramatic as it might seem. “The core problem in both cases is performance at scale. In banking and insurance, results vary, not because of motivation, but because training, feedback, and confidence differ. Traditional coaching can’t reach everyone, and managers can’t sit in on every conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI that understands conversations in real time now allows teams to receive consistent coaching, even in the highly regulated, complex industry, Kim noted.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png 4770w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=768,375 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=680,332 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=1200,586 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=1280,625 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=430,210 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=720,351 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=900,439 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=800,390 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=1536,750 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=2048,1000 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=668,326 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=1264,617 1264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=708,346 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Hupo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hupo has raised a $10 million Series A led by DST Global Partners, with participation from Collaborative Fund, Goodwater Capital, January Capital, and Strong Ventures. In addition, the Singapore-headquartered startup now serves dozens of customers in APAC and Europe, including Prudential, AXA, Manulife, HSBC, Bank of Ireland, and Grab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“BFSI [Banking, Financial Services and Insurance] is a notoriously difficult vertical for early-stage companies, but our customers typically expand contracts 3x to 8x within the first six months,” the founder said. “We’ll be expanding into the U.S. in the first half of this year, where distribution-heavy financial models create a strong need for scalable coaching.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kim started his career at Bloomberg, selling enterprise software to banks, asset managers, and insurers, where he saw how complex regulated sales could be. He later worked on product development at South Korean fintech Viva Republica, the company behind Toss, learning how technology built around real user behavior could reshape traditional financial services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Hupo sits at the intersection of those experiences. I understood the buyer, the end user, and the operational reality of selling financial products,” Kim said. “Once AI became capable of understanding context and coaching in real time, it became obvious to me that sales coaching — especially in banking and insurance — was the right place to apply it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many AI sales coaching tools start with the technology first, Kim said, but Hupo took a different approach, building its platform around how banks and insurers operate. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that, especially with large enterprises, you have to understand their business and industry in detail,” he added, noting that Hupo’s models were trained from the start on real financial products, common objections, client types, and regulatory requirements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest round brings total funding to $15 million since the company was founded in 2022. The new capital will go toward expanding its product, including real-time coaching features; scaling enterprise-grade deployments; growing go-to-market efforts in banking, financial services, and insurance; and building out the team.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In five years, Kim says he wants Hupo to go beyond sales coaching and help large teams perform at scale, giving managers and employees clearer insights and practical guidance, even across tens of thousands of people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s just a press of a button to turn recording on or off. In the app, you can configure whether a double press bookmarks a section of the conversation, processes the current conversation, or both, and you can set whether a press and hold gesture lets you leave a voice note or chat with the AI assistant.

Where it differs is that instead of offering an overview or a raw transcript, it segments the audio into sections and summarizes each part.

In addition, Bee discards the audio after transcription, making it a non-starter for use cases where you need to play back the audio to ensure accuracy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Bee isn’t necessarily meant to be a work tool. Amazon sees this as an AI that can live alongside you as you go about your day. By integrating with Google’s services, Bee can tie a recorded conversation to a task. For instance, after meeting someone at a conference, it could suggest that you friend them on LinkedIn or research their product.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?w=313\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082060\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=244,531 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bee screenshot with redacted personal data</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also leave yourself voice notes, as an alternative to writing something down in your notes app, for instance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another section in Bee’s app lets you look back at past days’ memories, while a “Grow” section will offer insights the more it learns about you.

Instead, you’re meant to ask if you can record someone’s conversation (unless at a public event of some sort, where recording is already expected).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you do record, a green light turns on, alerting others to the fact that the device is in use.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee’s sports band was a little flimsy. The band fell off twice while being worn, both times while just sitting and not moving the hands much (like in a taxi). We have not yet tested the clip-on pin, but it feels more sturdy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, the mobile app’s design is far ahead of the apps Amazon has built in-house, like the Alexa mobile experience, and it’s easy to use. But the premise that we need an AI specifically to record conversations to learn more about us is still largely untested. Is there a world where such devices make sense for consumers who aren’t recording in professional settings, like meetings and interviews?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, if AI listening devices go mainstream, there will also have to be some sort of cultural shift in terms of what’s appropriate and what’s not. Today, it’s somewhat looked down upon to record video of everyday people going about their lives, even though it’s technically legal when they’re in public; similarly, it may be considered tasteless or gauche to record audio with an AI device if you don’t first ask permission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not everyone will abide by that social contract, of course, which could see people self-censoring their speech in public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES, for instance, we were chatting with a rep at the Soundcore booth. When they liked something I said about a competitor’s product, they joked, ‘Say that louder into my microphone,’ pointing to the already-recording AI device subtly pinned to their shirt. It was an odd experience to realize that everything said in the real world could one day be “on the record,” whether you consented or not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee’s traction — or lack thereof — will help Amazon determine if that’s a world that consumers actually want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
