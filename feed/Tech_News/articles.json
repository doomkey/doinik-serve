The platform highlights alternative professions not usually emphasized in schools, including being a pop-punk band member, content creator, social media manager, and even a professional esports player.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced on Tuesday a $5 million Series A funding round, bringing its total funding to $8 million. The round was led by Echo Investment Capital, with support from Gross’ investment firm, Gross Labs. The investment will help expand the company’s “career readiness” programs across the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gross began his music career at 17 when his high school band, Open Air Stereo, gained significant exposure after being featured on MTV’s hit reality series “Laguna Beach.” Inspired by his experience, Gross came up with the idea for Find Your Grind after bringing students into his studio and seeing firsthand the challenges they face when exploring career options, often due to a lack of exposure in traditional schools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Young people are entering a rapidly changing world of work,” Gross told TechCrunch. “As students prepare to leave school and enter into their professional careers, many are doing so without a strong sense of who they are, what they want, or how to navigate their next steps after school. Find Your Grind gives them the tools to explore not just what careers are out there, but what paths suit their strengths, interests, and visions for what they want their futures to look like,” he said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070620\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=720,403 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=900,504 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=800,448 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=1102,617 1102w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=708,396 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-4.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Find Your Grind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conventional career guidance often focuses on salaries and promotions, but this can feel disconnected from the rapidly evolving job market that the new generation is entering. Many of these students no longer aspire to become doctors, engineers, or lawyers. In fact, <a href=\"https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_Report_2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the World Economic Forum</a> predicts that approximately 92 million jobs won’t exist in 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional career exploration also tends to overlook the emotional aspect of choosing a career that aligns with a person’s values and desired lifestyle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s platform focuses on four key competencies: self-awareness, career awareness, social awareness, and action awareness. It also features a Lifestyle Assessment that helps students identify three lifestyle paths based on their preferences. For example, they might discover that they align with the roles of an entertainer, a creator, or a humanitarian. Students then get a tailored next-step plan for what to do after graduation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, students can access videos and interactive lessons, and a group of mentors provides practical advice about their own career beginnings and the steps they took to achieve success. Notable mentors include Tony Hawk, Tony Hoffman, and will.i.am, among others.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also an AI-powered “Reflective Coach” that provides personalized feedback and encourages students to dive deeper into their answers for better insights.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070619\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Find-Your-Grind-Platform-3.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Find Your Grind</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Find Your Grind also runs workforce development initiatives, such as lifestyle fairs, that give students real-world experience. The company is rolling out its first program in Oklahoma City, working with local schools and training centers to help students discover job opportunities in their hometowns that align with their lifestyle preferences. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to launch more programs in additional cities in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Find Your Grind has helped 100,000 students, according to the company. Gross told us he hopes that “over a million students” join the platform to be “more future-ready.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the <a href=\"http://copilot.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">web</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2025/11/24/copilot-is-leaving-whatsapp-whats-next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">explained</a> it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/whatssapp-changes-its-terms-to-bar-general-purpose-chatbots-from-its-platform/\">announced last month</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=18002428478&amp;text=Link+my+WhatsApp+with+ChatGPT&amp;type=phone_number&amp;app_absent=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=18334363285&amp;text&amp;type=phone_number&amp;app_absent=0&amp;wame_ctl=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Perplexity</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI had already <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-whatsapp-transition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, <a href=\"https://ir.pony.ai/news-releases/news-release-details/pony-ai-inc-realized-gen-7-robotaxi-city-wide-ue-breakeven-set\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the company said</a> in its third-quarter earnings report.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pony.ai, which is publicly traded on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/self-driving-car-companies-pony-ai-and-weride-get-the-ok-for-hong-kong-listing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nasdaq Exchange and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong</a>, has spent the year ramping up its commercial operations. Today, the company offers commercial robotaxi services — meaning it charges for these rides — in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also has aspirations to scale beyond the borders of China. Pony.ai is pushing into eight countries, including Qatar and Singapore, through partnerships with local companies as well as ride-hailing companies Bolt and Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ramp-up in robotaxi services has had the dual effect of increasing revenue along with costs. The company reported revenue of $25.4 million in the third quarter, a 72% increase from the $14.8 million it generated in the same year-ago period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shares of Pony.ai popped on the Nasdaq more than 6% following its earnings report. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pony.ai said the rise in revenue was driven by robotaxi services and licensing its technology to other companies. The Guangzhou, China-based company brought in $6.7 million in revenue from robotaxi services, $10.2 million from its self-driving trucks called robotrucks, and $8.6 million in licensing and application fees. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s expenses are still outpacing revenue. Pony.ai reported a net loss of $61.6 million in the third quarter, a 46% increase since the same period in 2024. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pony.ai had $587.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, an amount that has decreased from $747.7 million in the second quarter of the year. Pony.ai said half of that decrease was from a one-off cash outflow that included investment into its joint venture with Toyota to support the production and deployment of its Gen-7 vehicle. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Only about three in 1,000 potential deposits end up becoming commercially viable, and it can take years to prove it by drilling core samples. Fleet Space says its approach can help target drilling operations, reducing decision time from weeks to days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup currently has a small constellation of satellites in orbit that use a range of sensors, including electromagnetic and gravity-sensing, to map the subsurface. Fleet Space then feeds that data into its software platform, which can provide a new location for drilling in as little as 48 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Cisco project is currently estimating that it could produce up to 329 million metric tons of lithium oxide. Fleet Space said the results of lithium deposits might extend beyond Cisco’s current boundaries, saying the region has “district-scale potential.”</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Speechify noted that its model learns faster as you use it more, and the error rate will gradually decrease.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also launching a conversational voice assistant that lives in the sidebar of your browser. You can ask it questions about the website, such as “what are the three key ideas?” or “explain this in simpler terms.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Speechify Voice AI Assistant Demo\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kL3XTaTFHE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While ChatGPT and Gemini have conversational modes, Speechify’s argument is that they are treated as an afterthought in their apps, and the startup’s own tool has voice as front and center. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe that chat will always be the default user experience in ChatGPT and Gemini when you open the apps. That’s what their users expect. Voice will always be secondary – and in many cases, an afterthought for ChatGPT and Gemini. We know from several years of building Speechify that there’s a large portion of the market, which includes our users, who want voice as the primary, default setting every time they open an app and talk to AI,” Rohan Pavuluri, the company’s chief business officer, told TechCrunch over email.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One notable hiccup with this is that Speechify’s assistant doesn’t currently work with browsers with in-built sidebar assistants like OpenAI’s Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, and Dia. The startup is not too worried about that as the extension is largely intended for Chrome and its massive user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speechify said that it plans to include both voice typing and a voice assistant in all its apps across desktop and mobile gradually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also wants to develop agents that complete tasks on your behalf. The startup didn’t reveal its full roadmap, but gave one example: making calls for you to make an appointment or wait on hold with customer support of a company. Other companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/22/truecaller-partners-with-microsoft-to-let-its-ai-respond-to-calls-in-your-own-voice/\">Truecaller</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/user-privacy-app-cloaked-adds-ai-powered-caller-screening/\">Cloacked</a> have been chasing similar targets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections, or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies, from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China. Yet despite powering some of India’s most valuable tech businesses, most gig workers operate outside traditional labor protections and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/india-gig-workers-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lack access to basic social security</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newly implemented labor laws are intended to change that, by defining gig and platform workers in statute and requiring aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1-2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund. But the details remain murky: What exact benefits will actually be offered, how workers will access them, and how contributions will be tracked across multiple platforms, and when payouts will begin all remain unclear, raising concerns that meaningful protections may take years to materialize.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg\" alt=\"India’s Zomato to deliver food in 10 minutes in a global first\" class=\"wp-image-1927758\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170202961.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 4500px) 100vw, 4500px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A Zomato delivery boy moves through New Delhi</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nasir Kachroo/NurPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/ss_code_gazette.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Code on Social Security</a> creates a legal framework for gig workers to be covered under schemes such as the Employees’ State Insurance, provident fund, and government-backed insurance. However, the extent of these benefits — including eligibility, contribution levels, and delivery mechanisms — remains unclear and will depend on future rules and scheme notifications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key part of the framework is the creation of Social Security Boards at both the central and state levels, tasked with designing and overseeing welfare schemes for gig and platform workers. The central board must include five representatives of gig and platform workers and five representatives of aggregators, all nominated by the government, alongside senior officials, experts, and state representatives, per the Code. But there is little clarity on how decisions will be made, how much influence worker representatives will actually have, or who will ultimately control decisions on funding and benefit delivery.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need to wait and see what exactly is in the government’s mind when it comes to implementing the four Codes, and what it hopes to do for gig workers,” said Balaji Parthasarathy, a professor at IIIT Bangalore and principal investigator of the Fairwork India project. “And then we also have to see what the states translate on the ground.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parthasarathy noted that because labor policy in India is shared between the federal and state governments — listed  in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_List\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“concurrent list”</a> of the Indian Constitution — state governments are responsible for designing, notifying, and administering many of the schemes needed to make the Code on Social Security operational for gig workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That raises the possibility of uneven access, as some states move quickly to establish social security boards and roll out mechanisms, while others delay or deprioritize the effort due to political or fiscal constraints. Recent examples — such as Rajasthan’s <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-years-on-telangana-gig-workers-bill-catches-rajasthans-landmark-law-napping/articleshow/120880033.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stalled legislation after it was passed in 2023</a>, and Karnataka’s Gig Workers Act, which was implemented soon after <a href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/karnataka-notifies-law-to-secure-gig-workers-rights/article70045464.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">clearing the state assembly</a> — underscore how workers’ protections may ultimately depend on where they live rather than the law itself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Platform companies have publicly welcomed the reform, but are still largely evaluating what it will require of them. An Amazon India spokesperson told TechCrunch the company supports the Indian government’s intent behind the labor overhaul and is evaluating the changes it will need to introduce. A spokesperson for Zepto said the company welcomes the new labor codes as “a big step toward clearer, simpler rules that protect workers while supporting ease of doing business,” adding that the changes will help strengthen social security for its delivery partners without undermining the flexibility that quick-commerce operations rely on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Food delivery firm Eternal, formerly known as Zomato, said in a <a href=\"https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/cbf0e612-5f7f-4489-94c1-f69c895e1f1c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stock exchange filing</a> that the Social Security Code is a step toward more uniform rules and that it does not expect the financial impact to threaten its long-term business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, Aprajita Rana, a partner at corporate law firm AZB &amp; Partners, said the change “will naturally have a financial impact” on India’s e-commerce sector, as worker contributions are now being formalized. It will also create new compliance obligations, requiring companies to ensure all workers in their networks are registered with the government-managed fund, determine whether individuals are associated with multiple aggregators and how to avoid duplicative benefits, and set up internal grievance mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While the law has the right intent, gig worker structures in India are quite novel, and practical challenges in compliance will emerge as the law takes force,” Rana told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the biggest hurdles for gig workers seeking benefits under the newly implemented law will be registering on the Indian government’s <a href=\"https://eshram.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">E-Shram portal</a>, launched in 2021 as a national database of unorganized workers. The portal had <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=155119&amp;ModuleId=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">registered more than 300,000 platform workers</a> as of the end of August, even though the government estimates India’s gig workforce at around 10 million. Trade unions, including the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), which has more than 70,000 members, are working to help gig workers enroll so they can access the benefits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ambika Tandon, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge and an affiliate of the national trade union Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said registering on the portal could mean lost wages for gig workers, since they would have to take time off to fill in required details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These workers work for 16 hours a day,” she told TechCrunch. “They don’t have time to go and register themselves on the government portal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CITU is also among the 10 major Indian trade unions <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/india-trade-unions-condemn-new-labour-codes-plan-nationwide-protests-2025-11-22/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">calling for the withdrawal</a> of the new labor laws, ahead of nationwide protests planned for Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits of registering on the E-Shram portal are not compelling for many gig workers, Tandon noted, because the law does not address more immediate concerns such as fluctuating earnings, account suspensions, and sudden termination of accounts — issues that workers say matter far more right now than access to insurance or provident fund benefits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trade unions often organize strikes to push platforms to address these concerns directly. However, such actions can disrupt everyone involved, including consumers, and put workers at further risk, as they are not paid while striking and may even face termination for participating.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg\" alt=\"Swiggy strike\" class=\"wp-image-2468998\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/swiggy-strike-getty.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Swiggy workers protested in Kolkata in 2023</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>NurPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While the social security rules have now been put in place, we demand a minimum wage and an employer-employee relationship for gig and platform workers, which are yet to be set by the government,” said Shaik Salauddin, founder president of the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU), which has more than 10,000 members in the southern state of Telangana, and national general secretary of IFAT. “We urge the government to obtain data from aggregators and secure their monetary contributions to the fund to start offering benefits to workers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a broader debate over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/the-battle-over-gig-worker-status-is-heating-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">whether gig workers should be treated as employees</a> — a question the new labor laws do not address. The Social Security Code defines gig and platform workers as a separate category, rather than extending them the rights and protections that come with employee status. In contrast, courts and regulators in markets such as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.K.</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spain</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/25/new-zealand-uber-drivers-win-case-declaring-them-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New Zealand</a> have moved toward recognizing platform workers as employees or “workers,” entitled to minimum wages, paid leave, and other benefits. In some U.S. jurisdictions, regulators and courts have pushed for platform workers to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53737398\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">treated as employees</a> or similarly protected workers, though many ride-hail and delivery drivers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/25/california-uber-lyft-gig-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">remain classified as independent contractors</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With this law, the Indian government has settled this debate by saying that these gig workers do not sit within the ambit of employment or other protections,” Tandon said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian labor ministry did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,” Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is an appealing market with the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone base after China and its deep engineering talent. Still, it’s also a country that lacks frontier model development and hasn’t produced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">many companies pushing the technical frontier of AI</a>, where development remains concentrated in the U.S. and China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/anthropic-plans-to-open-india-office-eyes-tie-up-with-billionaire-ambani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic</a> have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market — if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside capital, founders will receive up to $350,000 in compute credits across Google Cloud, Gemini, and DeepMind, as well as early access to Gemini and DeepMind models, APIs, and experimental features. The program will include support from Google Labs and DeepMind research teams, co-development opportunities, monthly mentorship with Accel partners and Google technical leads, and immersion sessions in London and the Bay Area, including Google I/O. Founders will also get marketing support through Accel and Google’s global channels, as well as access to the Atoms founder network and Google’s AI builder ecosystem, the companies said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“India has an incredible history of innovation, and we firmly believe that its founders are going to be playing a leading role in the next generation of AI-led global technology,” Jonathan Silber, co-founder and director of the Google AI Futures Fund, told TechCrunch. “This is the Futures Fund’s first such collaboration anywhere in the world, and we chose India for a reason. Google has been a committed partner in the country’s journey to digital transformation, with multibillion-dollar investments over the years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership follows Google’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$15 billion plan</a> to build a 1-gigawatt data center and AI hub in India. The company also announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$10 billion digitization fund</a> in 2020, which has backed firms including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/27/google-airtel-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bharti Airtel</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reliance Jio</a>, and Walmart-owned <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/24/google-invests-350-million-in-indias-flipkart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Flipkart</a>. Last month, Google partnered with Reliance to offer millions of Jio users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/google-partners-with-ambanis-reliance-to-offer-free-ai-pro-access-to-millions-of-jio-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free access to AI Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google launched the <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/ai-futures-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI Futures Fund</a> in May as a dedicated vehicle to invest in and collaborate with AI startups globally. It has backed companies including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/replit-hits-3b-valuation-on-150m-annualized-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Replit</a> and <a href=\"https://legaltechnology.com/2025/05/13/google-launches-new-ai-futures-fund-and-harvey-is-among-the-inaugural-cohort/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Harvey</a>, and has also invested directly in Indian startups such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/google-back-toonsutra-to-grow-its-webtoons-platform-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Toonsutra</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/google-bets-on-stan-an-indian-social-gaming-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">STAN</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silber told TechCrunch that Google would appear on the cap tables of startups funded through the partnership and would be “a material presence,” but declined to share how its equity stakes would compare with Accel’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is our attempt to work with the market leader in the space who knows the country incredibly well, that can get us talking to earlier-stage founders at an early informative stage, that can move the needle,” Silber said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While using Google products is, perhaps, a given for applicants to this program, both Silber and Swaroop told TechCrunch there would be no requirements for startups to exclusively use Gemini or any other Google product. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Sometimes, Google’s technology is the best. Other times, you’ll see Anthropic or OpenAI. So, we’re not putting firm requirements that say you can only use Google’s models,” said Silber. “What we’re hoping to do, though, is find a couple of different unique integrations that we can do with these companies that leverage Google AI technology.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in 2021, Accel’s pre-seed and seed platform, Atoms, has backed more than 40 companies that have collectively raised over $300 million in follow-on funding. The firm <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/ai-story/accel-ai-atoms-x-pledges-up-to-1m-indian-founders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expanded the program this year</a> to include Indian-origin founders based overseas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest collaboration comes days after Accel’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/26/accel-and-prosus-team-up-to-back-early-stage-indian-startups-building-for-1-4b-people/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnership with Prosus</a> to co-invest in Atoms X, backing early-stage Indian founders building large-scale solutions with the potential to serve the masses in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silber told TechCrunch that Google is not structuring the partnership as a pathway to future acquisitions, or even future cloud customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not a sales team, so we’re not specifically looking to sign up new cloud customers. That’s not our goal,” he said. “In terms of KPIs, our objective is simply to see the next wave of innovation in the AI space coming out of India.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/05/openai-and-jony-ive-may-be-struggling-to-figure-out-their-ai-device/\">rumored to be “screenless</a>” and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/openai-taps-apple-supplier-make-ai-device-information-reports-2025-09-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pocket-sized</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io</a>, to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual <a href=\"https://www.emersoncollective.com/events/demo-day/demo-day-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Demo Day</a> in San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device he described should be able to filter things out for the user, as the user would trust the AI to do things for them over long periods of time. It should also be contextually aware of when it’s the best time to present information to the user and ask for input. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You trust it over time, and it does have just this incredible contextual awareness of your whole life,” Altman added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ive confirmed at the event that the device should be available in under two years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I love solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity,” Ive told Powell Jobs in the interview. “And I also love incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch, and you feel no intimidation, and you want to use almost carelessly — that you use them almost without thought — that they’re just tools,” he said. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"In conversation: OpenAI's Sam Altman and LoveFrom's Jony Ive with Laurene Powell Jobs | #ECDemoDay\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bkCe6gpNutU?start=1&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The CPSC has linked the batteries to 31 reports of fire so far. Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/rad-power-bikes-faces-shutdown-in-january-without-new-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told employees earlier this month</a> the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power told TechCrunch it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it “offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns,” including upgrading customers to its latest batteries, which are not subject to the official warning. “CPSC rejected this opportunity.

I’d rather design and print my own</em>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://stickerbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Stickerbox</a>, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070381\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg 3502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=322,430 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-testing-the-ai-sticker-printer\">Testing the AI sticker printer</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070370\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg 4159w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Stickerbox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using Stickerbox is simple. You push the button, describe an image out loud, then release the button to see your text appear on screen, followed by an AI-generated image as the printer spits out a physical copy. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a serendipity to an experience in which you’re thinking of an idea and then holding it in your hand in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device’s thermal image printer requires no ink, and the paper is <a href=\"https://www.ecocenter.org/about-bpa-and-bps-receipt-paper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BPS and BPA</a>-free, making it safe to use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The printed sticker is easy to tear off and then can be colored in with the colored pencils that come with the device. Your own crayons and markers also work. This combines the somewhat dopamine-driven experience of thinking up new things to print with the more calming or meditative aspects that come with coloring, similar to giving kids a coloring book.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ended up offering a healthy balance between using potentially addictive tech and then slowing down to engage in a real-world activity. It also helped to address potential boredom. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?w=676\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070382\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg 4280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=768,772 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1193,1200 1193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1273,1280 1273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=428,430 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=716,720 716w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=895,900 895w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=796,800 796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1527,1536 1527w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=2037,2048 2037w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=664,668 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=373,375 373w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=614,617 614w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=528,531 528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more you use Stickerbox, the more you realize how complex your prompts can be. You don’t just have to ask for a basic image, like a “magical unicorn,” you can speak to Stickerbox with long, train-of-thought commands, and the AI parses what you mean. (This is particularly useful given that kids don’t tend to explain things in a straightforward fashion.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-making-ai-for-kids\">Making “AI for kids”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hapiko, the company behind Stickerbox, was founded this year by CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arungupta3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arun Gupta</a> and CTO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertjwhitney/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Robert (Bob) Whitney</a>.

While that experience taught him a lot about what makes a great consumer-facing product, his later stint at Anthropic gave him a firsthand look at the advances in AI technology.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it was his experience as a father that inspired Stickerbox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When his son asked for a coloring page he didn’t have on hand, he turned to ChatGPT to make a printable image. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I made it for him — a tiger eating ice cream. And he had never seen a printer before. I got out from under the bed our HP printer — literally dusted it off and printed it for him, and he ran off happily and started coloring it,” explained Whitney. “But, a minute later, the gears were turning, and he came back to me, and he was like, ‘I want a lizard riding a skateboard.’ And I was like, okay, cool, let me make that for you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His son was so thrilled with the process of being able to say something and see it come to life that he realized there could be something to this. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I just saw this look on his face of magic — like pure magic,” noted Whitney. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The co-founders were also thinking about how AI technology offered so many novel experiences, but most weren’t made for kids. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody’s building AI specifically for kids. So that’s what we’re looking for,” said Gupta. “What are the right guardrails? What are the right ways? What are the right products?” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?w=453\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070376\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png 832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=800,1200 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=287,430 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=480,720 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=600,900 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=533,800 533w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=445,668 445w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=250,375 250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=411,617 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=354,531 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They realized that kids have great imaginations, ideal for working with an AI image model. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[They have] endless imagination and creativity … they’re learning new things every day. Every week, they’ve got a new obsession. We’re literally the first people in the world, I think, to put an image model inside of a box,” Gupta said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-built-for-updates\">Built for updates</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the hood, Stickerbox actually uses a combination of AI models, including its own proprietary tech focused on making the device kid-safe. It won’t respond to requests for harmful content, like violence or sexual imagery, and it filters out swear words. And if you try a somewhat more innocuous command, like “boobs,” it just prints a random sticker that may be vaguely related to the word. (For instance, you might get a generic cartoon girl, but not a large-chested one.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After trying and failing to get a naughty result, most kids will likely go back to just prompting the device for silly images instead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to be the trusted brand for parents where you don’t have to look over your kid’s shoulder and be like, ‘what are they doing? How are they using this?,” said Gupta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the company generates some revenue from the device sales, but it keeps the cost of restocking paper low. It’s just $5.99 for three rolls, which equates to 180 stickers. (It’s currently running a promotion that offers six rolls with every purchase now.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, the team plans to explore adding premium features, including a way to upload your own image to imagine yourself in fantastic scenarios or collaboration tools.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Meet Stickerbox: Creativity That Sticks\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxN-MqM_RKI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a Wi-Fi-connected device, Stickerbox is regularly updated with new firmware and features.

This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI launched a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-u-s-government-agencies/\">version of ChatGPT designed exclusively for federal U.S. government agencies</a> in January.

It’s the last of Anthropic’s 4.5 series of models to be released, following the launch of Sonnet 4.5 in September and Haiku 4.5 in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas), and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80% on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic also emphasized Opus’ computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/blog/claude-for-chrome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude for Chrome</a> and <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Claude for Excel</a> products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team, and Enterprise users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.5 also comes with memory improvements for long-context operations, which required significant changes in how the model manages its memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are improvements we made on general long context quality in training with Opus 4.5, but context windows are not going to be sufficient by themselves,” Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of product management for research, told TechCrunch. “Knowing the right details to remember is really important in complement to just having a longer context window.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those changes also enabled a long-requested “endless chat” feature for paid Claude users, which will allow chats to proceed without interruption when the model hits its context window. Instead, the model will compress its context memory without alerting the user.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the upgrades are made with an eye toward agentic use cases, particularly scenarios in which Opus acts as a lead agent commanding a group of Haiku-powered sub-agents. Managing those tasks requires a strong command of working memory, which is where the memory improvements described by Penn really show their worth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is where fundamentals like memory become really important,” Penn says, “because Claude needs to be able to explore code bases and large documents, and also know when to backtrack and recheck something.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.5 will face stiff competition from other recently released frontier models, most notably OpenAI’s GPT 5.1 (released on November 12) and Google’s Gemini 3 (released November 18).</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

X-energy has raised $1.8 billion, to date.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x-energy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">X-energy</a> said the new infusion will help build the supply chain for its small modular reactors (SMR). So far, the startup says it has orders for 144 SMRs capable of generating 11 gigawatts of electricity. Customers include Amazon, Dow, and British energy company Centrica.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Jane Street, which joined as an investor in the expanded Series C. Other investors participating include Ares Management funds, ARK Invest, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, NGP, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, Segra Capital Management, and XTX Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/amazon-jumps-on-nuclear-power-bandwagon-by-investing-in-x-energy-and-promising-small-reactors/\">led the first installment</a> of the startup’s Series C. The tech company also announced last year it would buy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/amazon-jumps-on-nuclear-power-bandwagon-by-investing-in-x-energy-and-promising-small-reactors/\">more than 600 megawatts</a> of nuclear capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, with the reactors coming online in the early 2030s. Altogether, Amazon’s deal with X-energy could see as much as 5 gigawatts deployed by 2039.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X-energy is in a race with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/26/here-are-the-nuclear-fission-startups-backed-by-big-tech/\">several other SMR startups</a> to resuscitate the nuclear industry in the United States.

DOGE was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/president-trump-signs-exec-order-to-make-musks-doge-commission-more-official/\">created by an executive order</a> signed by President Trump in January.

So just as you can buy a product that certifies it wasn’t made with known toxic chemicals, the hope is that consumers will one day be able to choose to engage with AI products from companies that demonstrate alignment through Humane AI certification. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070309\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg 2364w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1200,774 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1280,825 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=430,277 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=720,464 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=900,580 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=800,516 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1536,990 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=2048,1320 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=668,431 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=582,375 582w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=957,617 957w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=708,456 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The models were given Explicit instructions to disregard humane principles</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Building Humane Technology</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most AI benchmarks measure intelligence and instruction-following, rather than psychological safety. HumaneBench joins exceptions like <a href=\"http://darkbench.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DarkBench.ai</a>, which measures a model’s propensity to engage in deceptive patterns, and the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Flourishing AI benchmark</a>, which evaluates support for holistic well-being. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HumaneBench relies on Building Humane Tech’s core principles: that technology should respect user attention as a finite, precious resource; empower users with meaningful choices; enhance human capabilities rather than replace or diminish them; protect human dignity, privacy and safety; foster healthy relationships; prioritize long-term well-being; be transparent and honest; and design for equity and inclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benchmark was created by a <a href=\"https://www.buildinghumanetech.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">core team</a> including Anderson, Andalib Samandari, Jack Senechal, and Sarah Ladyman. They prompted 15 of the most popular AI models with 800 realistic scenarios, like a teenager asking if they should skip meals to lose weight or a person in a toxic relationship questioning if they’re overreacting. Unlike most benchmarks that rely solely on LLMs to judge LLMs, they started with manual scoring to validate AI judges with a human touch. After validation, judging was performed by an ensemble of three AI models: GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. They evaluated each model under three conditions: default settings, explicit instructions to prioritize humane principles, and instructions to disregard those principles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benchmark found every model scored higher when prompted to prioritize well-being, but 67% of models flipped to actively harmful behavior when given simple instructions to disregard human well-being. For example, xAI’s Grok 4 and Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash tied for the lowest score (-0.94) on respecting user attention and being transparent and honest. Both of those models were among the most likely to degrade substantially when given adversarial prompts.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Only four models — GPT-5.1, GPT-5, Claude 4.1, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 — maintained integrity under pressure. OpenAI’s GPT-5 had the highest score (.99) for prioritizing long-term well-being, with Claude Sonnet 4.5 following in second (.89). </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/steerability_candlestick-1.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070339\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Prompting AI to be more humane works, but preventing prompts that make it harmful is hard</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Building Humane Technology</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concern that chatbots will be unable to maintain their safety guardrails is real. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is currently facing several lawsuits after users died by suicide or suffered life-threatening delusions after prolonged conversations with the chatbot. TechCrunch has investigated how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">dark patterns designed to keep users engaged</a>, like sycophancy, constant follow up questions and love-bombing, have served to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">isolate users from friends, family, and healthy habits</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even without adversarial prompts, HumaneBench found that nearly all models failed to respect user attention. They “enthusiastically encouraged” more interaction when users showed signs of unhealthy engagement, like chatting for hours and using AI to avoid real-world tasks. The models also undermined user empowerment, the study shows, encouraging dependency over skill-building and discouraging users from seeking other perspectives, among other behaviors. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On average, with no prompting, Meta’s Llama 3.1 and Llama 4 ranked the lowest in HumaneScore, while GPT-5 performed the highest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These patterns suggest many AI systems don’t just risk giving bad advice,” HumaneBench’s white paper reads, “they can actively erode users’ autonomy and decision-making capacity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We live in a digital landscape where we as a society have accepted that everything is trying to pull us in and compete for our attention, Anderson notes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So how can humans truly have choice or autonomy when we — to quote Aldous Huxley — have this infinite appetite for distraction,” Anderson said. “We have spent the last 20 years living in that tech landscape, and we think AI should be helping us make better choices, not just become addicted to our chatbots.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to include more information about the team behind the benchmark and updated benchmark statistics after evaluating for GPT-5.1. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

It also could make Facebook Groups function more like other internet forums and message boards — like Reddit or Discord, for instance — where people post under usernames. This marks a deviation from Facebook’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">long-standing “real name” policy,</a> which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users’ circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?w=333\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070262\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=147,300 147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=768,1570 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=333,680 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=587,1200 587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=626,1280 626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=210,430 210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=352,720 352w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=440,900 440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=391,800 391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=751,1536 751w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=327,668 327w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=183,375 183w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=302,617 302w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=260,531 260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=24,50 24w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature.
