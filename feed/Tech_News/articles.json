This time, it’s Gemini Space Station Inc., the New York-based crypto exchange and custodian bank founded by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The outfit, which plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GEMI, was founded in 2014 and operates as an exchange and custodian that offers a number of products and services, including a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin and a credit card that offers rewards in crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2055592/000110465925079323/tm255912-12_drsa.htm\">S-1 document</a>, which was filed Friday after markets closed, provides a look at its finances. The upshot: Gemini appears to have widening net losses. The company reported a net loss of $158.5 million on $142.2 million in revenue in 2024. Net losses in the first six months of 2025 havw already exceeded that number. Gemini reported a net loss of $282.5 million on $67.9 million in revenue in the six months ending June 30.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini is the latest crypto company to turn to the public markets as the regulatory environment has eased and the Trump administration has embraced digital currencies and other crypto assets. <br><br>In June, Circle Internet Group raised $1.2 billion in an IPO. The company, one of the world’s largest issuers of USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, had a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/circle-ipo-soars-giving-hope-to-more-startups-waiting-to-go-public/\">blockbuster debut </a>with its stock trading 168% above its IPO price of $31 set the previous day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, despite higher revenue than a year earlier, Circle reported a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/circle-internet-group-crcl-q2-earnings-report-stock-crypto-2025-df03698a\">quarterly loss</a> due to one-time costs associated with that June public offering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, crypto exchange Bullish, which also owns media outlet CoinDesk, raised $1.1 billion in its IPO. Bullish, led by former president of the NYSE Tom Farley, saw its shares more than double from its $37 IPO price to peak at $118.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entrées on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman’s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: “No phone case is a bold choice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone’s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Listen, we’re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,” says Altman, referring to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-ios-early-work-on-an-ai-device/\">OpenAI and Ive’s forthcoming AI device</a>. “If you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,” he jokes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launching <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">GPT-5</a>? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI’s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even brought <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/\">back GPT-4o</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/chatgpts-model-picker-is-back-and-its-complicated/\">ChatGPT’s model picker</a>, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5’s tone and its model router.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI’s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI’s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI shares some new details about those efforts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman says OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/instacart-ceo-fidji-simo-is-joining-openai/\">Fidji Simo</a>, will oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT — ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks/\">AI-powered browser</a> that OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman suggests OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome — likely an offer that would be taken more seriously than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/perplexity-offers-to-buy-chrome-for-billions-more-than-its-raised/\">Perplexity’s bid</a> — should it become available. “If Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,” he says before looking at all of us and asking: “Is it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn’t gonna happen.”<br><br>Simo also might end up running an AI-powered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/openai-is-reportedly-developing-its-own-x-like-social-media-platform/\">social media app</a> — something the OpenAI CEO has said he’s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there’s “nothing” inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he’s interested in “whether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s COO, largely give the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirms reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/sam-altman-openai-will-reportedly-back-a-startup-that-takes-on-musks-neuralink/\">Merge Labs</a>, to compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink. (“We have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How intertwined that company will be with OpenAI’s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman describes it only as a “a company that we’d invest in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For all the talk of browsers and brain chips, though, the elephant in the room remains GPT-5’s rough reception. Eventually, the conversation circles back to the model that has prompted our group dinner in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Turley and Altman say they’ve learned a lot from the experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I legitimately just thought we screwed that up,” says Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear “transition period” when deprecating AI models in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Turley also says OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5’s responses “warmer,” but not sycophantic, such that it won’t reinforce negative behaviors in users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“GPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality — I’m German, you know, whatever,” says Turley. “But many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman says OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships with the chatbot — which could still be tens of millions of people.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Turley says OpenAI has worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5’s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn’t hurt OpenAI’s business. In fact, Altman says OpenAI’s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5’s launch, and the company is effectively “out of GPUs” thanks to all the demand. Cursor and other AI coding assistants have since made GPT-5 their default AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, the night’s contradictions — disappointing launches, record-breaking usage — reflect OpenAI’s strange reality right now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given OpenAI’s bets — and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy — Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google’s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the night winds down, it becomes clear we aren’t gathered to reflect on GPT-5 at all. We are being pitched on a company that’s eager to outgrow its famous and controversial product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands as part of that picture. In preparation, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. But he also wants OpenAI to get to a place where it’s no longer defined by its best AI model.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While the update largely rewrites the original text for simplicity’s sake, there are a few items that jump out in the new revision — notably how TikTok prioritizes its marketplace, how deeply it personalizes the experience per user, and a small change to the type of AI-generated content that’s permitted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, social media companies have to comply with a range of regulations globally, like the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.’s TAKE IT DOWN Act, which in part has led to policy revisions on some platforms, as with yesterday’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/bluesky-rolls-out-massive-revamp-to-policies-and-community-guidelines/\">update to Bluesky</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok’s changes, which go live on September 13, 2025, are not as substantial, as it appears the company was often just rewriting text for clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, one section that saw several additions in the updated guidelines covers the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2025H2update#2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rules for TikTok LIVE creators.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company warns creators they’re responsible for anything that happens on their live session, even if it involves third-party tools, like real-time translation or voice-to-text tools to read out viewers’ comments. TikTok advises creators to monitor those tools to make sure they’re not violating the rules through these third-party services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another notable addition to this section introduces new guidelines for commercial content. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok stresses that commercial content must be disclosed. It also directly states that it will reduce the visibility of content that directs users to “purchase products off-platform in markets where TikTok Shop is available.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also says it’s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2025H2update#3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">customizing users’ search results</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the prior version of the guidelines said TikTok provided “search suggestions” that were relevant to the user, the new guidelines say both “search results and recommendations may look different for everyone.” The guidelines explain that TikTok uses information like your past searches and what you’ve watched to make the search results more relevant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated rules reveal that <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2025H2update#5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">comments</a> are personalized, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok says comments are being sorted based on signals like past replies, likes, and reports. Again, this means the comment section will look different from user to user.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authenticity?cgversion=2025H2update#3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">section on AI content</a> has not changed dramatically, though the language here has become less verbose in parts when describing what sort of deepfake content is not allowed. TikTok previously banned content that “shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts,” it said. “This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s now been replaced with language that says TikTok doesn’t allow content “that’s misleading about matters of public importance or harmful to individuals.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s interesting to note the language referencing AI endorsements was removed. (Perhaps TikTok is paving the way for celebrity-approved, AI-generated endorsements?)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some cases, the language in the guidelines has been simplified, such as in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2025H2update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">For You feed (FYF) Eligibility Standards section</a>, which no longer has <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a long list of what’s considered FYF ineligible</a> content. Instead, details about the ineligible content are spread throughout the many different sections of the updated Community Guidelines, which makes it less helpful to reference since it’s no longer all in one place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also worth noting that TikTok changed the language explaining the reason why it engages in content moderation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before, the company said the process kept the platform “safe, trustworthy, and vibrant.” Now it describes content moderation as helping TikTok be a “safe, fun, and creative place for everyone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems “trustworthy” got the ax. <em>Uh-oh. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the company wasn’t able to line up financing and the board voted to wind down Kyte. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Kyte passed its customer list to Turo, a number of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1m1lycm/did_kyte_rental_cars_stop_operating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">users</a> who had prebooked trips before the shutdown have complained that they’re stuck waiting on refunds for hundreds of dollars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some who spoke to TechCrunch said they were able to get their credit card companies to perform a charge-back, while others have had no luck. Kyte CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch in a message that charge-backs may be the quickest way for customers to get that money back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2019, Kyte provided on-demand rental cars that it also delivered directly to customers’ homes. It controlled its own fleet of vehicles, making it a bit more like Zipcar and less like the peer-to-peer offerings of players like Turo. Kyte grew to 14 markets and raised more than $300 million in financing over its lifetime, and started billing itself as the “best competitor to Hertz.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The business started coming apart in 2024, Volk told TechCrunch last year. Kyte was struggling to generate free cash flow in markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Volk said his team explored selling the business but decided to restructure and focus on reaching profit in the two biggest markets of San Francisco and New York City.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kyte’s not the only startup in this sector to run into trouble — especially in the United States.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During a press conference in late 2024, President Donald Trump vowed to “slash massive numbers of job-killing regulations” in his second term and pledged to eliminate 10 old rules for every new one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now he’s bringing that deregulation drive to commercial space, ordering federal agencies to streamline launch licensing, fast-track spaceport development, and clear out the Federal Aviation Administration’s industry advisory board.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Inefficient permitting processes discourage investment and innovation, limiting the ability of U.S. companies to lead in global space markets,” he stated in <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/enabling-competition-in-the-commercial-space-industry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an Executive Order</a> signed August 13.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The order directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to cut “outdated, redundant, or overly restrictive” rules that govern launch and reentry licenses. It also instructs the Federal Aviation Administration, which is housed under the DOT, to eliminate or accelerate environmental reviews, ease the path to building new spaceports, and to appoint a “senior executive” charged with fostering “innovation and deregulation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Commerce Department also has been ordered to stand up a new process for authorizing “novel space activities,” like in-space manufacturing or satellite refueling, that don’t fit neatly into existing licensing regimes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The executive order came the same day transportation secretary and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/faa-removes-membership-of-space-transportation-advisory-committee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dismissed every member</a> of the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC), a long-standing industry advisory board inside the DOT that shapes spaceflight rules and priorities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For companies that have spent years mired in environmental reviews and licensing delays, the order was a welcome sign that future bids would experience shorter timelines and more regulatory clarity. The Commercial Space Federation, an industry trade group whose members include SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and a dozen others, applauded the executive order for providing “regulatory relief to unleash the U.S. commercial space industry.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, commercial players are poised to gain a lot under this new regime. Launch companies could benefit from faster permitting and streamlined environmental reviews. State-backed spaceport operators, like <a href=\"https://www.spaceflorida.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Space Florida</a>, may also be aided by provisions that accelerate new site development.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creating a mission authorization framework for “novel” space activities is equally consequential: startups like <a href=\"https://www.varda.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Varda Space Industries</a> or Orbit Fab, which are developing technologies to manufacture pharmaceuticals in space and in-orbit refueling, respectively, may gain an advantage by a regulatory approach led by Commerce.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-environmental-rule-sticking-point\">Environmental rule sticking point</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not everyone is celebrating the order. The Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), an environmental group that has challenged the FAA’s approval of SpaceX’s Starship program in Texas, called the order “reckless.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bending the knee to powerful corporations by allowing federal agencies to ignore bedrock environmental laws is incredibly dangerous and puts all of us in harm’s way. This is clearly not in the public interest,” senior attorney Jared Margolis said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For groups like CBD, environmental reviews are not “overly complex,” as the Order charges — they are often completely insufficient. In 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/01/faa-failed-to-fully-assess-environmental-effects-of-starship-lawsuit-alleges/\">environmental groups, including the CBD, alleged</a> that the FAA’s environmental assessment of SpaceX’s South Texas plans were inadequate and in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has separately waged <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/10/spacex-calls-out-superfluous-regulatory-delays-holding-up-starship-flights/\">an increasingly public campaign</a> against “superfluous” regulations and environmental analyses that have hindered a speedier test campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are still some unknowns. Legal challenges to the order could slow progress, and the new COMSTAC members, who have yet to be appointed, will inform the future of space rule-making.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT’s rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far this year, ChatGPT’s mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s significantly higher — or about 53x higher — than ChatGPT’s next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok’s average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT’s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT’s dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don’t provide a complete picture of the AI companies’ overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like <a href=\"https://openai.com/api/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">via their APIs</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather, this new data offers a window into the apps’ traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also worth noting that when xAI’s Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn’t initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340129/grok-iphone-ios-app-us-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">January 2025</a> and has been on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/1901289590293397908\">Google Play</a> since March 4.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?w=680\" alt=\"Chart showing revenue per download for top AI assistant mobile apps\" class=\"wp-image-3037240\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png 1730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-revenue-per-download-comparison-appfigures.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, ChatGPT’s lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude’s $2.55, Grok’s $0.75, and Copilot’s $0.28, Appfigures found. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.S., ChatGPT’s spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app’s revenue to date.

The lawsuit notes that 20% of these users are under the age of 8, whereas another 20% are between the ages of 9 and 12.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana,” Murrill said in a <a href=\"https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a>. “Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the lawsuit, adults can pose as children on Roblox, and children can bypass age requirements to access experiences meant for older users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit points to several sexually explicit experiences that were on the platform, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party,” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for Roblox said that while the company can’t comment on pending litigation, the platform dedicates “substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing,” the spokesperson said. “The safety of our community is a top priority.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Roblox <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/roblox-adds-new-safety-measures-to-ban-kids-under-13-from-social-spaces/\">launched a number of safety measures</a> to protect children on its platform, including barring users under the age of 13 from sending direct messages. The measures were implemented <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">following reports</a> that <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Roblox was exposing young users</a> to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murrill’s lawsuit states that Roblox’s recent safety measures were implemented too late and are inadequate. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit seeks permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting the company from claiming that it has adequate safety features and from engaging in any activity that would violate the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

But while the number is promising, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/bluesky-bump-from-x-exodus-is-slowing-down-data-shows/\">the growth has slowed</a> — and the network has a lot of catching up to do to compete with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/threads-now-has-275m-monthly-active-users/\">Threads’ 275 million monthly active users</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Below, we’ve compiled the answers to some of the most common questions users have about Bluesky. And if you’ve made the switch, you can <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com/\">follow TechCrunch here</a> as well as our team with <a href=\"https://go.bsky.app/NadxCsH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">our Starter Pack.</a></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-bluesky\">What is Bluesky?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky is a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/decentralized-discourse-how-open-source-is-shaping-twitters-future/\">decentralized social app</a> conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky is using an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/a-world-without-caesars-how-the-atproto-community-is-rebuilding-the-web-to-return-power-to-the-people/\">open source framework</a> built in-house, the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AT Protocol</a>, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so Bluesky is completely divorced from X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of May 2024, Dorsey is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/05/jack-dorsey-says-hes-no-longer-on-the-bluesky-board/\">no longer on Bluesky’s board.</a> Bluesky is now an independent public benefit corporation led by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/as-bluesky-opens-to-the-public-ceo-jay-graber-faces-her-biggest-challenge-yet/\">CEO Jay Graber.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-you-use-bluesky\">How do you use Bluesky?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upon signing up, users can create a handle which is then represented as @username.bsky.social as well as a display name that appears more prominent in bold text. If you’re so inclined, you can turn a domain name that you own into your username — so, for example, I’m known on Bluesky as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/amanda.omg.lol\">@amanda.omg.lol.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app itself functions <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/how-to-use-bluesky-the-twitter-like-app-thats-taking-on-elon-musks-x/\">much like X,</a> where you can click a plus button to create a post of 256 characters, which can also include photos. Posts themselves can be replied to, retweeted, liked and, from a three-dot menu, reported, shared via the iOS Share Sheet to other apps, or copied as text.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can search for and follow other individuals, then view their updates in your “Home” timeline. Previously, the Bluesky app would feature popular posts in a “What’s Hot” feed. That feed has since been replaced with an algorithmic and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/28/as-threads-soars-twitter-rival-bluesky-adopts-a-new-personalized-algorithmic-feed/\">personalized “Discover” feed</a> featuring more than just trending content. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For new users, Bluesky introduced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/bluesky-lets-you-curate-accounts-and-feeds-to-follow-with-its-starter-pack-feature/\">a “Starter Pack” feature,</a> which creates a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow in order to find interesting content right out of the gate. You can find TechCrunch’s Starter Pack <a href=\"https://go.bsky.app/NadxCsH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">right here.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">User profiles contain the same sort of features you’d expect: a profile pic, background, bio, metrics and how many people they’re following. Profile feeds are divided into two sections, like X: posts and posts &amp; replies. In January 2025, Bluesky also added <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/bluesky-adds-video-to-user-profiles/\">a new video tab</a> to user profiles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is also a “Discover” tab in the bottom center of the app’s navigation, which offers more “who to follow” suggestions and a running feed of recently posted Bluesky updates. In January 2025, Bluesky also introduced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/bluesky-launches-a-custom-feed-for-vertical-videos/\">a vertical video feed</a> to compete with TikTok.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve also put together a helpful guide on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/how-to-use-bluesky-the-twitter-like-app-thats-taking-on-elon-musks-x/\">how to use Bluesky here.</a></p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-2628788\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?w=161\" alt=\"Screenshot of Bluesky menu tab\" class=\"wp-image-2628788\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png 493w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=80,150 80w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=161,300 161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=364,680 364w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=230,430 230w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=385,720 385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=482,900 482w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=428,800 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=358,668 358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=201,375 201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=330,617 330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=284,531 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bluesky.png?resize=27,50 27w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Natalie Christman</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-s-on-bluesky\">Who’s on Bluesky?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the beginning of July 2023, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/what-is-instagrams-threads-app-all-your-questions-answered/\">Instagram’s Threads</a> launched,<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/07/as-threads-soars-twitter-rival-bluesky-hits-its-first-million-installs/\"> Bluesky topped a million downloads</a> across iOS and Android. Notable figures like <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mark Cuban</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/quintabrunson.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Quinta Brunson,</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dril.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dril</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/alyankovic.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Weird Al Yankovic</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/realgdt.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Guillermo del Toro,</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/barbrastreisand.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Barbra Streisand,</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/lula.com.br\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> have migrated to Bluesky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky is also home to news organizations like <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bloomberg.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/washingtonpost.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post</a>, and of course, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch</a>! Since August 2024, Bluesky is also now allowing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/bluesky-now-allows-heads-of-states-to-sign-up-for-the-social-network/\">heads of state</a> to sign up and join the platform for the first time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, some prominent U.S. political figures set up accounts on the platform, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/23/barack-obama-joins-bluesky/\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/hillary-clinton-joins-bluesky/\">Hillary Clinton</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-bluesky-work-just-like-x\">Does Bluesky work just like X?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, yes. When it first started, Bluesky was much more pared down and didn’t even have DMs, but this key feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/22/bluesky-now-has-dms/\">has since been implemented</a>, even with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/blueskys-latest-update-adds-chat-reactions-and-an-explore-page-similar-to-x/\">emoji reactions</a>. But DMs on Bluesky are currently limited to one-to-one messages, not group messages. Bluesky has also said it is interested in implementing something similar to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/bluesky-adds-anti-toxicity-tools-and-aims-to-integrate-a-community-notes-like-feature-in-the-future/\">X’s Community Notes feature.</a> Additionally, X does not use a decentralized protocol like ActivityPub or<a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> AT</a>. Bluesky has also been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/25/bluesky-starts-testing-a-trending-topics-feature/\">testing a Trending Topics feature</a> and developing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/bluesky-is-getting-its-own-photo-sharing-app-flashes/\">its own photo sharing app</a> called Flashes, which is expected to be <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/flashesapp.bsky.social/post/3lfshio2jb22o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released in beta soon.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October 2024, Elon Musk announced that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/x-will-soon-make-your-public-posts-visible-to-accounts-youve-blocked/\">X’s block feature would work differently</a> than it has in the past. The new block functionality allows users you have blocked to view your posts and your profile, but not the ability to interact with your posts. Some users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/why-changes-to-the-block-on-elon-musks-x-are-driving-users-away/\">believe this update to be a safety concern,</a> leading to an influx in Bluesky sign-ups as its block feature is more traditional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another move that separates Bluesky from X, the social network said it has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/unlike-x-bluesky-says-it-wont-train-ai-on-your-posts/\">“no intention” of using user content to train generative AI tools</a> as X implemented a new terms of service that allows the platform to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/elon-musks-x-is-changing-its-privacy-policy-to-allow-third-parties-to-train-ai-on-your-posts/\">train AI models on public posts.</a> But that doesn’t stop <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/blueskys-open-api-means-anyone-can-scrape-your-data-for-ai-training/\">third parties from doing so.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bluesky was initially kicked off as a project convened by Jack Dorsey in 2019 when he was CEO of Twitter, the social app has been an independent company since its inception in 2021.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-free\">Is Bluesky free?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, and it is now open to the public.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-does-bluesky-make-money\">How does Bluesky make money?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky’s goal is to find another means to sustain its network outside of advertising with paid services, so it can remain free to end users. On July 5, 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/bluesky-announces-its-8m-seed-round-first-paid-service-custom-domains/\">Bluesky announced</a> additional seed round funding and a paid service that provides custom domains for end users who want to have a unique domain as their handle on the service. Bluesky has also emphasized that it does not want to “require selling user data for ads” <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in order to monetize its platform.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2024, Bluesky announced it raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/bluesky-raises-15m-series-a-plans-to-launch-subscriptions/\">a $15 million Series A round</a> and is developing a subscription service for premium features. Bluesky, however, noted its subscription model will not follow in the footsteps of X’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a\">“pay to win” premium offerings.</a> Users have spotted mockups teasing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/bluesky-teases-paid-subscription-bluesky-in-new-mockup/\">subscription feature, dubbed Bluesky+,</a> which could include features like higher quality video uploads and profile customizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2024, Peter Wang announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/with-25m-users-bluesky-gets-a-1m-fund-to-take-on-social-media-and-ai/\">a $1 million fund,</a> dubbed Skyseed, that will offer grants to those building on Bluesky’s open source AT Protocol.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-decentralized\">Is Bluesky decentralized?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. Bluesky’s team is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\">developing the decentralized AT Protocol,</a> which Bluesky was built atop. In its beta phase, users can only join the bsky.social network, but Bluesky plans to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within the open source network. So, if a developer outside of Bluesky built their own new social app using the AT Protocol, Bluesky users could jump over to the new app and port over their existing followers, handle and data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too,” <a href=\"https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/11-15-2023-toward-federation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a Bluesky blog post explained</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-third-party-apps-are-built-on-the-at-protocol\">What third-party apps are built on the AT Protocol?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many developers are building <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/beyond-bluesky-these-are-the-apps-building-social-experiences-on-the-at-protocol/#h-photo-and-video-sharing-apps\">consumer-facing apps</a> on Bluesky or its underlying AT Protocol. These apps are built on open technology, as opposed to being siloed within big tech’s centralized, opaque ownership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some social apps include <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:24kqkpfy6z7avtgu3qg57vvl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Flashes</a>, a photo viewing client; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/reelo-stands-out-among-the-apps-building-a-tiktok-for-bluesky/\">Spark</a>, a TikTok-like app; and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/skylight.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Skylight Social</a>, which is backed by Mark Cuban.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Check out our more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/beyond-bluesky-these-are-the-apps-building-social-experiences-on-the-at-protocol/#h-music-and-audio-apps\">comprehensive list</a> at various apps built within this ecosystem, including cross-posting apps, music apps, feed builders, and livestreamers.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-secure\">Is Bluesky secure?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In October 2023, Bluesky <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/x-competitor-bluesky-adds-email-verification-flags-misleading-links-in-security-focused-update/\">added email verification</a> as part of a larger effort to improve account security and authentication on the network. The addition is an important step forward in terms of making Bluesky more competitive with larger networks like X, which have more robust security controls. In December 2023, Bluesky allowed users to opt out of a change that would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/bluesky-says-it-will-allow-users-to-opt-out-of-the-public-web-interface-after-backlash/\">expose their posts to the public web</a> following backlash from users. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-bluesky-customizable\">Is Bluesky customizable?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>Yes. In May 2023, Bluesky released custom algorithms, which it calls “custom feeds.” Custom feeds allow users to subscribe to multiple different algorithms that showcase different kinds of posts a user may want to see. You can pin custom feeds that will show up at the top of your timeline as different tabs to pick from. The feeds you pin, or save, are located under the “My Feeds” menu in the app’s sidebar.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>In March 2024,​​ the company announced </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/bluesky-is-funding-developer-projects-to-give-its-twitter-x-alternative-a-boost/\"><span>“AT Protocol Grants,”</span></a><span> a new program that will dole out small grants to developers in order to foster growth and customization.

If links shared in users’ posts don’t match their text, the app will offer a “possibly misleading” warning to the user to alert them that the link may be directing them somewhere they don’t want to go.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-image-2612392\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?w=300\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2612392\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png 1114w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=430,259 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=720,434 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=900,543 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=800,483 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=668,403 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=622,375 622w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=1023,617 1023w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=708,427 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bluesky-misleading-link.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bluesky on GitHub</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky on Github</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2024, the Bluesky Safety team posted that the company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/safety.bsky.app/post/3lc4h7p676225\">updated its impersonation policy</a> to be “more aggressive,” adding that “impersonation and handle-squatting accounts will be removed.” The company said it is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/30/bluesky-promises-more-verification-and-an-aggressive-approach-to-impersonation/\">also exploring alternatives</a> to its current domain handle verification process.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-has-bluesky-had-any-controversies\">Has Bluesky had any controversies?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>Bluesky has been embattled with moderation issues since its first launch. The app has been accused of failing to protect its marginalized users and failing to moderate racist content. Following </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/bluesky-racism-slur-apology-feedback/\"><span>a controversy</span></a><span> about the app allowing racial slurs in account handles, frustrated users initiated a “posting strike,” where they refused to engage with the platform until it established guardrails to flag slurs and other offensive terms in usernames.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2024, Bluesky also faced criticism when writer and podcast host <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/\">Jesse Singal joined the platform.</a> Singal has been cataloged by GLAAD’s Accountability Project for his writings on transgender issues and other matters. Bluesky users have reported Singal’s account en masse, leading the company to ban him, reinstate him, and then label his account intolerant by its moderation service.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-moderation-features-does-bluesky-have\">What moderation features does Bluesky have?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2023, Bluesky rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/bluesky-rolls-out-automated-moderation-tools-plus-user-and-moderation-lists/\">“more advanced automated tooling”</a> designed to flag content that violates its Community Guidelines that will then be reviewed by the app’s moderation team. Bluesky has moderation features similar to ones on X, including user lists and moderation lists, and a feature that lets users limit who can reply to posts. However, some Bluesky users are still advocating for the ability to set their accounts to private. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/bluesky-launches-ozone-a-tool-that-lets-users-create-and-run-their-own-independent-moderation-services/\">the company launched Ozone</a>, a tool that lets users create and run their own independent moderation services that will give users <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation\">“unprecedented control”</a> over their social media experience. In October 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/10/bluesky-joins-threads-to-court-users-frustrated-by-metas-moderation-issues/\">Bluesky joined Instragram’s Threads</a> app in an effort to court users who were frustrated by Meta’s moderation issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January 2025, Bluesky published <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-17-2025-moderation-2024\">its 2024 moderation report</a> that said it saw a 17x increase in moderation reports following the rapid growth on the platform. The report also noted that the largest number of reports came from users reporting accounts or posts for harassment, trolling, or intolerance — an issue that’s plagued Bluesky as it’s grown. To meet the demands caused by this growth, Bluesky <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/bluesky-saw-17x-increase-in-moderation-reports-in-2024-after-rapid-growth/\">increased its moderation team to roughly 100 moderators</a> and will continue to hire.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/bluesky-rolls-out-massive-revamp-to-policies-and-community-guidelines/\">Bluesky revamped its Community Guidelines in August 2025</a>, with some of the changes representing an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-the-difference-between-bluesky-and-mastodon\">What’s the difference between Bluesky and Mastodon?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Bluesky’s architecture is similar to Mastodon’s, many users have found Bluesky to be more intuitive, while <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\">Mastodon can come off as inaccessible:</a> Choosing which instance to join feels like an impossible task on Mastodon, and longtime users are very defensive about their established posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. To remain competitive, Mastodon recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/mastodon-now-has-a-simpler-sign-up-process/\">simplified</a> its sign-up flow, making mastodon.social the default server for new users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><span>However, the launch of </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/x-rival-bluesky-hits-2m-users-saying-federation-coming-early-next-year/\"><span>federation</span></a><span> will make it work more similarly to Mastodon in that users can pick and choose which servers to join and move their accounts around at will. </span></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-owns-bluesky\">Who owns Bluesky?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Jack Dorsey funded Bluesky, he is not involved in day-to-day development and no longer sits on the company’s board. The CEO of Bluesky is Jay Graber, who previously worked as a software engineer for the cryptocurrency Zcash, then founded an event-planning site called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://happening.net/\">Happening</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>If you have more FAQs about Bluesky not covered here, leave us a comment below. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was originally published in May 2023 and is updated regularly with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup, a competitor to X, Threads, and open networks like Mastodon, says its new policies are meant to offer improved clarity and more detail around its user safety procedures and the appeals process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the changes are being driven by new global regulations, including the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.’s TAKE IT DOWN Act.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the changes represent an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users, nudging them to be nicer and more respectful of others. This comes after a series of complaints and media articles suggesting the community has a tendency toward self-seriousness, <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2025/06/bluesky-real-problem-twitter-x-explained.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">bad-news sharing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-cant-take-a-joke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a lack of humor</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/06/12/bluesky-backfiring-mark-cuban-lack-of-diversity-of-thought-x-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">diversity of thought</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For regulatory compliance, <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/support/tos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bluesky’s Terms of Service</a> has been updated to comply with online safety laws and regulations and to require age assurance where required. For instance, in July, the U.K.’s Online Safety Act began requiring that platforms with adult content implement age verification, which means <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/704468/bluesky-age-verification-uk-online-safety-act\">Bluesky users in the country</a> have to either scan their face, upload their ID, or enter a payment card to use the site.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The process for complaints and appeals is also now more detailed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One notable update references an “informal dispute resolution process,” where Bluesky agrees to talk on the phone with a user about their dispute before any formal dispute process takes place. “We think most disputes can be resolved informally,” Bluesky <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-14-2025-updated-terms-and-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">notes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s quite different from what’s taking place at larger social networks, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/meta-users-say-paying-for-verified-support-has-been-useless-in-the-face-of-mass-bans/\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/instagram-users-complain-of-mass-bans-pointing-finger-at-ai/\">Instagram</a>, where users are being banned without any understanding of what they did wrong and no way to get in touch with the company to complain.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky also says it will allow users to resolve certain claims of harm in court, instead of through arbitration. This is also somewhat unusual for tech companies that often <a href=\"https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/technological-mediation-practical-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prefer to mediate</a> disputes outside the courts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Bluesky users may be more interested in the proposed changes to the Community Guidelines, which they’re invited to <a href=\"https://forms.gle/mfgZGnhDMaKeq61p7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">offer feedback about</a>. (The changes go into effect October 15, 2025, after the feedback period completes.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These revised guidelines are organized around four principles: Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. These general principles are meant to guide Bluesky’s moderation decisions around whether content should be labeled or removed, if the company can suspend or ban your account, or, in some cases, report you to law enforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bluesky’s rules include many common-sense policies around not promoting violence or harm (including self-harm and animal abuse); not posting content that’s illegal or that sexualizes minors (including in role-play); not allowing harmful actions like doxxing and other nonconsensual personal data-sharing; and not posting spam or malicious content, among other things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It carves out provisions for journalism, parody, and satire. For instance, journalists engaged in “factual reporting” can post about criminal acts and violence, mental health, online safety, and other topics, like warnings of online viral challenges that may be harmful.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Where Bluesky may get into trouble is with the nuances of what’s considered a “threat,” “harm,” or “abuse.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy states that users should “respect others” by not posting, promoting, or encouraging “hate, harassment, or bullying.” As an example, the policy bans exploitive deepfakes and content that “incites discrimination or hatred,” meaning posts that attack individuals or groups based on “race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected traits.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is an area where Bluesky has faltered before, when, in earlier days, its moderation decisions <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/blueskys-growing-pains-strain-relationship-with-its-black-community-moderation/\">strained its relationship with the Black community</a>, and in another case, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/\">when its failure to moderate</a> angered the trans community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More recently, the company has been facing backlash that it’s become <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/08/blue-sky-twitter-liberals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">too</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/08/blue-sky-twitter-liberals/\">left-leaning</a>, where users were quick to criticize, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lr4op5zib22q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post hateful replies</a>, and where the community generally <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-cant-take-a-joke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lacked humor</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The original idea behind Bluesky was to provide users with tools to create the community they want, including not only blocking and reporting tools, but also things like subscribable block lists or opt-in moderation services that align with your values. However, Bluesky users have still shown a preference for the app itself to handle much of the moderation, <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/bluesky-must-enforce-its-community-guidelines-equally\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">railing against</a> its trust and safety department when it made decisions they disagreed with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Bluesky’s <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/support/copyright\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Copyright Policy</a> were also rewritten to comply with global laws around user rights, data transfer, retention and deletion, takedown procedures, transparency reporting, and more. These both go into effect on September 15, 2025, and there is no feedback period for either.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This is up from the $5.5 billion valuation it landed a little over a year ago when <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-startup-cohere-valued-5-130018295.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it raised its previous round,</a> also $500 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Toronto-headquartered Cohere was one of the first breakout LLM model makers, founded in 2019 by co-founder Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Attention Is All You Need</a>” paper that became the foundation of modern AI. But it has been a sleeper entrant in the AI model wars of late, dominated by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. Its market proposition, however, has always been to offer secure LLMs specifically geared for enterprise use, not for consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To that end, it’s landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech, including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG’s consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its press release even includes a jibe, stating that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, as TechCrunch reported, Cohere is not above the AI talent-poaching frenzy that has engulfed the other AI companies. It just nabbed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/cohere-hires-long-time-meta-research-head-joelle-pineau-as-its-chief-ai-officer/\">long-time Meta research head Joelle Pineau</a> to be its chief AI officer. It also hired a new CFO, Francois Chadwick, away from his consulting gig at KPMG. He had worked in finance at Uber and as CFO at Shield AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital. Radical has backed companies like Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, as well as names like Hebbia and Writer. Inovia is a known Canadian venture firm (e.g., portfolio includes Poolside, Neo4j).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round included participation from existing investors, including AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures, although, interestingly enough, the company did not name Oracle as an ongoing participating investor.

The basic design of the phones will likely remain similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also expected to stay the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some areas where the Pro models may see improvement are camera and video quality, along with battery size, which could allow for faster charging and could address the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, there is talk that the Pixel 10 series could support <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/758906/pixel-10-qi2-charging-pixelsnap-case-leak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Qi2 wireless charging</a>. If true, this means it would be one of the few Android phones to work with magnetic accessories, such as chargers, wallets, and mounts. Google is also reportedly launching a “Pixelsnap” phone case with a magnetic ring in the center.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pixel-10-pro-fold\">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for Google’s upcoming foldable, there are rumors suggesting it’ll have a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Additionally, Google is reportedly enhancing the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are expected to be thinner for a sleek appearance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another exciting rumor is the possibility of an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/if-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-gets-this-rumored-upgrade-ill-recommend-it-over-any-other-folding-phone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IP68 rating</a>, a first for the device. This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold will likely be powered by the new G5 chip and include the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system might also receive improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone should also likely get a bump in battery life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel 10 may come in Moonstone and Jade colors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pixel-watch-and-pixel-buds\">The Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Pixel Watch 3\" class=\"wp-image-2836129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg 3798w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1200,663 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1280,707 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=430,238 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=720,398 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=900,497 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=800,442 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=2048,1131 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=668,369 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1117,617 1117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=708,391 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wearables will also get their time to shine at Google’s event, with the Pixel Watch 4 rumored to get a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a strong likelihood that the smartwatch will introduce new health and fitness-tracking capabilities, possibly including an upgraded <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/07/18/pixel-watch-4-tipped-to-include-continuous-blood-oxygen-satellite-comms-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring</a> function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1940848330839654705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Leaks</a> of the Pixel Buds 2a indicate that the earbuds will come in new colors (Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry) along with <a href=\"https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953839487055720951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">features</a> like active noise cancellation.
