The changes include a mandatory premium account, fewer test users, and a limited number of API endpoints.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2021-05-27-improving-the-developer-and-user-experience-for-third-party-apps\">debuted Developer Mode in 2021</a> to allow developers to test their applications with up to 25 users. Spotify is now limiting each app to only five users, and requires devs to have a Premium subscription. If developers need to make their app available to a wider user base, they will have to apply for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes\">extended quota</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify says these changes are aimed to curb risky AI-aided or automated usage. “Over time, advances in automation and AI have fundamentally altered the usage patterns and risk profile of developer access, and at Spotify’s current scale, these risks now require more structured controls,” the company said in a blog post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that development mode is meant for individuals to learn and experiment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For individual and hobbyist developers, this update means Spotify will continue to support experimentation and personal projects, but within more clearly defined limits. Development Mode provides a sandboxed environment for learning and experimentation. It is intentionally limited and should not be relied on as a foundation for building or scaling a business on Spotify,” the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also deprecating several API endpoints, including the ability to pull information like new album releases, an artist’s top tracks, and markets where a track might be available. Devs will no longer be able to perform actions like add or remove tracks, albums, or audiobooks via the development mode API, nor will they be able to pull an album’s record label information, artist follower details, and artist popularity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This decision is the latest in a slew of measures Spotify has taken over the past couple of years to curb how much developers can do with its APIs. In November 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/spotify-cuts-developer-access-to-several-of-its-recommendation-features/\">the company cut access to certain API endpoints</a> that could reveal users’ listening patterns, including frequently repeated songs by different groups. The move also barred developers from accessing tracks’ structure, rhythm, and characteristics.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2025, the company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes\">changed its baseline</a> for extended quotas, requiring developers to have a legally registered business, 250,000 monthly active users, be available in key Spotify markets, and operate an active and launched service.

Sapiom’s goal is to make this whole process seamless, letting the AI agent decide what to buy and when without human intervention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the future, apps are going to consume services which require payments.<strong> </strong>Right now, there’s no easy way for agents to actually access all of that,” said Amit Kumar, a partner at Accel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kumar has met with dozens of startups in the AI payments space, but he believes Zerbib’s focus on the financial layer for enterprises, rather than consumers, is what’s truly needed to make AI agents work. That’s why Accel is leading Sapiom’s $15 million seed round, with participation from Okta Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Array Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Anthropic, and Coinbase Ventures.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you really think about it, every API call is a payment. Every time you send a text message, it’s a payment. Every time you spin up a server for AWS, it’s a payment,” Kumar told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s still early days for Sapiom, the startup hopes that its infrastructure solution will be adopted by vibe-coding companies and other companies creating AI agents that will eventually be tasked with doing many things on their own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, anyone who has vibe-coded an app with SMS capabilities won’t have to manually sign up for Twilio, add a credit card, and copy an API key into their code. Instead, Sapiom handles all of that in the background, and the person building the micro-app will be charged for Twilio’s services as a pass-through fee by Lovable, Bolt, or another vibe-coding platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Sapiom is currently focused on B2B solutions, its technology could eventually empower personal AI agents to handle consumer transactions. The expectation is that individuals will one day trust agents to make independent financial decisions, such as ordering an Uber or shopping on Amazon. While that future is exciting, Zerbib believes that AI won’t magically make people buy more things, which is why he’s focusing on creating financial layers for businesses instead.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, it offered an update on its plans to merge traditional and AI search together and hinted that although search is not yet monetized, “it’s an enormous market and opportunity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In particular, the company believes that generative AI search will be “better for most queries.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a type of query we’re, I think, particularly good at — I would argue, the best on the internet — which is questions that have no answers, where the answer actually is multiple perspectives from lots of people,” said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional search, meanwhile, is more like navigation — it’s a way to find the right link to a topic or subreddit. But LLMs can be good at this, too, if not better, he said. “So that’s the direction we’re going.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec also noted that weekly active users for search over the past year grew 30% from 60 million users to 80 million users. Meanwhile, the weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers grew from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing a lot of growth there, and I think there’s a lot of potential too,” Huffman added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit said it’s working to modernize the AI answers interface by making its responses more media-rich, and pilots of this are already underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also thinking about how it can position itself when it’s not just a social site, but a place people come for answers. Reddit told investors on the call that it’s doing away with the distinction between logged-in and logged-out users starting in Q3 2026, as it will aim to personalize the site — using AI and machine learning — and make it relevant to whoever shows up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced in 2025 it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/reddit-hints-at-expanded-ai-powered-search/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">planning to combine</a> its AI search feature, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/reddit-tests-a-conversational-ai-search-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reddit Answers</a>, with its traditional search engine to improve the experience for end users. In the fourth quarter, Reddit said it had made “significant progress” in unifying its core search and its AI feature. It also released five new languages on Reddit Answers and is piloting dynamic agents along with search results that include “media beyond text.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Reddit sees value in its AI answers, it’s not been keeping that to itself. The company’s content licensing business, which allows other companies to train their AI models on its data, is growing, too. That business revenue is reported as part of Reddit’s “other” revenues (i.e., its non-ad revenue). This “other” revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to reach $36 million in Q4 and was up 22% to reach $140 million for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This figure marks a 24% year-on-year increase and the business segment’s largest growth rate in 13 quarters. Annual revenue run rate for the business segment is $142 billion, according to Amazon. The cloud service also saw an increase in its operating income from $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $10.6 billion in the same period in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s very different having 24% year-over-year growth on $142 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth on a meaningfully smaller base, which is the case with our competitors,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “We continue to add more incremental revenue and capacity than others, and extend our leadership position.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That fourth-quarter growth was fueled by new agreements with Salesforce, BlackRock, Perplexity, and the U.S. Air Force, among other companies and government entities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More of the top 500 U.S. startups use AWS as their primary cloud provider than the next two providers combined,” Jassy said. “We’re adding significant easy to core computing capacity each day.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS also added more than a gigawatt of power to its data center network in the fourth quarter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jassy said AWS still sees a fair amount of its business coming from enterprises that want to move infrastructure from on-premise to the cloud. AWS is, of course, also seeing a boost from the AI boom, and Jassy credited AWS’s top-to-bottom AI stack functionality.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We consistently see customers wanting to run their AI workloads where the rest of their applications and data are,” Jassy said. “We’re also seeing that as customers run large AI workloads on AWS, they’re adding to their core AWS footprint as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS made up 16.6% of Amazon’s overall $213.4 billion revenue in the fourth quarter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS’s success wasn’t enough to appease Amazon investors, however.

Whoever builds the most data centers will have the most compute, the thinking goes, and thus be able to build the best AI products, which will guarantee victory in the years to come. There are limits to this way of thinking — traditionally, businesses eventually succeed by making <em>more</em> money and spending <em>less</em> — but it’s proven remarkably persuasive for large tech companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that is the game, Amazon does seem to be winning. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_earnings/2025/q4/earnings-result/AMZN-Q4-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in its earnings on Thursday</a> that it projects $200 billion in capital expenditures throughout 2026, across “AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites.” That’s up from the $131.8 billion in capex in 2025. It’s tempting to attribute the whole capex budget to AI. But unlike most of its competitors, Amazon has a significant physical plant, some of which is being converted for use by expensive robots, so the non-AI expenses aren’t so easy to wave away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is close behind. <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In its earnings on Wednesday</a>, the company projected between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, up from $91.4 billion the previous year. It’s significantly more than the company spent on fixed assets last year, and significantly more than most of its competitors are spending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/zuckerberg-teases-agentic-commerce-tools-and-major-ai-rollout-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported last week</a>, projected $115 billion to $135 billion in capex spending for 2026, while Oracle (once the poster child for AI infrastructure) projects <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-rising-cloud-capex-driving-170200149.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL77es57yTOLuIcB2pvuokR_bjBnL1rbkdBNhK6W3Fyx_2aZ4uZfgt9JfdkEuwxUIAmBX0FZ4c-fAJctMjqWo3cqi0kjxavy3mpueIoiklQiWGLoD_5TmzxLqjPjSPdD_1POB9Zwqyk0FqVTr0IZzX2q-wFFQbiLTRM-fq_KaO21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a measly $50 billion</a>.

It’s a notable increase, and one that has led to investor pressure on CEO Satya Nadella — but it still puts the company in third place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From within the tech world, the logic here is simple. The revolutionary potential of AI is going to turn high-end compute into the scarce resource of the future, and only companies that control their own supply will survive. But while Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and others are frantically prepping for the compute desert of the future, their investors aren’t convinced. Each company saw its stock price plummet as investors balked at the hundreds of billions of dollars being committed, and companies with higher spends tended to drop more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, this isn’t just a problem for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">companies like Meta</a> that haven’t figured out their AI product strategy yet. It’s everyone — even companies like Microsoft and Amazon with a robust cloud business and a straightforward take on how to make money in the AI era. The numbers are simply too high for investor comfort.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investor sentiment isn’t everything — and in this case, it may not do much to change the industry’s mind. If you believe AI is about to change everything (and the argument is pretty compelling at this point), you’d be a fool to change course just because Wall Street got jumpy.

This tech, much of it created in Silicon Valley, sits on your wrist, is carried in your pocket, is integrated in the movies you watch, and maybe in the music you listen to. And it is certainly the means by which that Amazon package was ordered, sorted, and delivered to your doorstep. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It has turned their founders, executives, and middle managers into king-like figures, whose wealth and political influence mirrors the Gilded Age. Seven of the top 10 richest people in the world can tie their wealth directly to tech. Amazon co-founder, chairman, and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is third, behind just Meta co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Forbes</a>, which tracks wealth and the people who have it. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer round out the list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, in this moment, the Bezos-owned Washington Post has gutted its coverage of them and the tech industry at large as part of a sweeping set of layoffs that affected more than 300 people. The team that includes tech, science, health, and business was cut by more than half — from 80 to 33 people — according to Post <a href=\"https://x.com/drewharwell/status/2019155688140812777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tech reporter Drew Harwell</a>. The tech desk alone cut 14 people. Its San Francisco bureau is a shell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among those affected include reporters covering Amazon, artificial intelligence, internet culture, and investigations. The newspaper also laid off staff covering the media industry (which had previously reported on Bezos’ ownership over their own paper). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post cut its entire sports bureau and nearly annihilated its foreign reporting teams, including its Middle East desk, and reporters and their editors covering Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and others. It closed its Books section, decimated coverage of culture and the Washington, D.C., metro area, and laid off all reporters and editors covering race and ethnicity issues nationally. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The coverage of tech isn’t more important than social, economic, and geopolitical issues. But never before have the people exerting outsized influence on the world’s geopolitics and economy also been so directly responsible for stemming the global flow of information about it. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet even as the world centers on tech and is tied to the GDP growth — or retreat — of its superpowers, tech’s most powerful executives are asking the public to place their attention elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post’s executive editor Matt Murray couched the layoffs as a reboot of sorts aimed at reaching readers and eventually profitability, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the New York Times</a>, which included comments he made to staff. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If anything, today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people’s lives in what is becoming a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,” he reportedly said during a Zoom meeting with staff.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s no secret The Post has lost money and subscribers in recent years, in some cases due to policies crafted or backed by Bezos. For instance, his directive to end presidential endorsements by The Post’s editorial board, axing a drafted piece backing Kamala Harris, reportedly led to “hundreds of thousands” of canceled subscriptions, per the New York Times. It reportedly suffered $100 million in losses in 2024, in part because of the cancellations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its web traffic has also <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-sad-and-self-inflicted-decline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">declined</a>. Semafor <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/01/12/2025/letter-from-la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that daily visits were down to around 3 million by the middle of 2024, from 22.5 million in January 2021.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Post cut its staff from 1,000 to under 800 last spring, with CEO Will Lewis calling out the $100 million loss from the previous year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The layoffs at The Post, of course, don’t exist in a vacuum. The media industry, and not just legacy players, has been plagued by a fragmented audience and changes to Google Search algorithms that have directed readers away from news outlets and toward its own AI-generated answers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The size, scope, and location of those cuts merit scrutiny, however — particularly considering the shift in media ownership over the past 15 years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bezos’ acquisition of the Post in 2013 for $250 million was met with a mix of skepticism and hope from weary journalists who had experienced consolidation, layoffs, and the growing pains of moving from a print-only to digital-dominant media industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His acquisition became part of a broader trend at the time in which billionaires, many with backgrounds in tech, snapped up beleaguered media organizations well worn from the previous go public-private equity cycle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few years after Bezos bought The Post, Laurene Powell Jobs purchased The Atlantic, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time Inc., and pharmaceutical executive Patrick Soon-Shiong acquired the Los Angeles Times. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bezos, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/18/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-apologizes-for-saying-national-guard-troops-needed-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benioff</a> and Soon-Shiong (who also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/media/la-times-editor-quits-patrick-soon-shiong-endorsement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blocked</a> his paper’s endorsement of Harris), moved closer to Trump after he won the 2024 election. His spaceflight company Blue Origin relies on <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-ula-expected-clinch-multibillion-dollar-contract-key-pentagon-launch-2025-04-04/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">federal contracts</a>, and Amazon had faced increased scrutiny under previous administrations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lewis was reportedly not present to oversee the staff cuts and changes at The Post (Murray <a href=\"https://x.com/jeremymbarr/status/2019204813574271228\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">told Fox News</a> that the CEO “had a lot of things to tend to today”). Nor was Bezos.

But one aspect of it is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-5IsqFgrZM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">completely unique to these times</a>: startups rocketing from $0 to as much as $100 million in annual recurring revenue, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/as-lovable-hits-200m-arr-its-ceo-credits-staying-in-europe-for-its-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sometimes in a matter of months.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Word on the street is that many a VC won’t even look at a startup that’s not on the ARR superhighway, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregoiregambatto_if-you-planned-to-be-at-2m-arr-and-raise-activity-7380932640482414592-O0Pm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">aiming for $100 million in ARR before their Series A</a> funding round.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Andreessen Horowitz general partner Jennifer Li⁠, who helps oversee many of the firm’s most important AI companies, warns that some of the ARR mania is based on myths. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not all ARR is created equal, and not all growth is equal either,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Li said on an episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast</a>. She said to be especially skeptical of a founder announcing spectacular ARR numbers or growth in a tweet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, there is a legit, well-recognized term in accounting called annual recurring revenue, which refers to the annualized value of contracted, recurring subscription revenue. Essentially, that’s a guaranteed level of revenue because it comes from customers on a contract. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what many of these founders are tweeting about is really “revenue run rate” —  taking whatever money was paid in a period of time and annualizing it. That’s not the same.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s a lot of missing nuances of the business quality, retention, and durability that’s missing in that conversation,” Li warned.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A founder may have just had a killer month of sales, but not every month will necessarily repeat it. Or a startup may have a lot of short-term customers doing pilot programs, so revenue isn’t guaranteed to stick around after the pilot period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Normally, such boasts about growth via tweets should be treated for what they are — that is, don’t take everything you read on the internet at face value. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But because fast growth is a hallmark of AI startups, such claims are “introducing a lot of anxiety” to inexperienced founders who are now asking how they can also instantly go from zero to $100 million, she said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li’s answer: “You don’t. Sure, it’s a great aspiration, but you don’t have to build a business that way, to only optimize for the top-line growth.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She said a better way to think of it is this: how to grow sustainably, where once customers sign up, they stick around and expand their spend with your company. This can lead to “growing 5x or 10x year-over-year,” said Li, meaning growth from $1 million to between $5 million and $10 million in year one, to between $25 million and $50 million in year two, and so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li pointed out that this is still “unheard of” levels of growth. If it’s coupled with happy customers — that is, high retention rates — those startups will find investors willing to back them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, some of the portfolio companies in Li’s a16z group (the infrastructure team) have hit those kinds of racing ARR numbers: Cursor, ElevenLabs, and Fal.ai. But that growth is tied to “durable businesses,” said Li, adding, “There’s real reasons behind each of them.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li also said that kind of growth comes with its own set of operational problems like hiring. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“How do we hire, not fast, but the right people who can really jump into this type of speed and culture,” she said. And the answer is: not easily. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means those first 100 people wear a lot of hats and missteps are bound to happen. Last year, Cursor, for instance, angered its customer base <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with a poorly rolled out pricing change.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li pointed out that other fast-growth startups deal with legal and compliance issues before they have systems in place to, or face new AI-age issues like countering deepfakes. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So while lightning-fast growth can be a good problem to have, it’s also a little bit of “be careful what you wish for.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Listen to the full episode here:</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But a week later, it is clear that he is dead serious. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most obvious step, of course, is the formal merger between SpaceX and xAI that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">went forward on Monday</a>, officially drawing together Musk’s space and AI ventures in a way that makes a lot more sense if there’s some kind of joint infrastructure project planned. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But even beyond the merger, we’re starting to see the idea of orbital AI data clusters — essentially, networks of computers operating in space — cohere into an actual plan. On Wednesday, the FCC accepted the filing and set a schedule seeking public comment. It’s a pro forma step normally, but FCC chairman Brendan Carr took the unusual step of <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/2019139559330836506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sharing the filing on X</a>. Throughout his tenure as chairman, Carr has shown himself <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/612069/fcc-brendan-carr-elon-musk-donald-trump-first-amendment-free-speech-censorship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eager to help Trump’s friends and punish his enemies</a> — so as long as Musk stays on Trump’s good side, the proposal is likely to sail through without issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, Elon Musk has started to flesh out the argument for orbital data centers in public. On a <a href=\"https://cheekypint.transistor.fm/21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new episode</a> of Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison’s podcast “Cheeky Pint,” which also featured guest Dwarkesh Patel, Musk laid out the basic case for moving most of our AI computing power into space. Essentially, solar panels produce more power in space, so you can cut down on one of the main operating expenses for data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space,” Musk said in the podcast. “Any given solar panel is going to give you about five times more power in space than on the ground, so it’s actually much cheaper to do in space.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Close listeners will note that there is a bit of a gap in the logic here! It’s true that solar panels produce more power in space, but since power isn’t the only cost in operating a data center and solar panels aren’t the only way to power a data center, it doesn’t follow that it’s cheaper to do the whole thing in orbit, as Patel noted in the podcast. Patel also raised concerns about servicing GPUs that fail during AI model training, but you’ll have to listen to the full episode for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Musk was undeterred, marking 2028 as a tipping point year for orbital data centers. “You can mark my words, in 36 months but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,” Musk said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He didn’t stop there. “Five years from now, my prediction is we will launch and be operating every year more AI in space than the cumulative total on Earth,” Musk continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For context, as of 2030, global data center capacity will be <a href=\"https://www.jll.com/en-us/insights/market-outlook/data-center-outlook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an estimated 200 GW</a>, which is roughly a trillion dollars’ worth of infrastructure when you’re just putting it on the ground.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, SpaceX makes its money by launching things into orbit, so all this is pretty convenient for Musk — particularly now that SpaceX has an AI company attached to it. And with the new SpaceX-xAI conglomerate headed for an IPO in just a few months, you can expect to hear a lot more about orbital data centers in the months ahead. With tech companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">still pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into data center spending each year</a>, there’s a real chance that not all the money will remain earthbound.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For those working in government bureaucracy, it’s equally exciting, apparently, that NASA approved this rule change pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” Isaacman wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It makes sense that it would be hard to approve new technology to go into space — if one small thing goes astray, a spaceflight can go terribly wrong. Until now, the newest cameras that were supposed to go on these missions were decade-old Nikon DSLRs and GoPros, according to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-will-finally-allow-astronauts-to-bring-their-iphones-to-space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ars Technica</a>.

It’s an open platform, which means users can manage agents built outside of OpenAI too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Frontier users can program AI agents to connect to external data and applications, which allows them to execute tasks far outside of the OpenAI platform. Users can also limit and manage what these agents have access to, and what they can do, of course.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said Frontier was designed to work the same way companies manage human employees. Frontier offers an onboarding process for agents and a feedback loop that is meant to help them improve over time the same way a review might help an employee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI touted enterprises, including HP, Oracle, State Farm, and Uber as customers, but Frontier is currently only available to a limited number of users with plans to roll out more generally in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company would not disclose pricing details in a press briefing earlier this week, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/874258/openai-frontier-ai-agent-platform-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reporting from The Verge</a>. OpenAI declined to comment on pricing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agent-management products become table stakes since AI agents rose to prominence in 2024. Salesforce has arguably the best-known such product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/29/salesforce-ai-chatbot-agentforce-hits-general-availability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Agentforce</a>, which the company launched in the fall of 2024.

Opus 4.5 was only released <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last November</a>, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">currently offers</a>. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">White told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software development — into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Coming just months after its Series B, Clay’s offer of liquidity was a rarity in a market where tender offers, as these types of secondary transactions are known, were still uncommon for relatively young companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, several other newer, fast-growing startups have allowed their staff to convert some of their stock into cash. Linear, a six-year-old AI-powered Atlassian rival, completed <a href=\"https://linear.app/now/giving-our-team-liquidity-through-linear-s-first-tender-offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a tender offer</a> at the same valuation as the company’s $1.25 billion Series C. More recently, the three-year-old ElevenLabs authorized a $100 million secondary sale for staff, at a valuation of <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/announcing-an-employee-tender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$6.6 billion</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elevenlabs-raises-180-million-in-series-c-funding-at-3-3-billion-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">double</a> its previous value.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And just last week, Clay, which has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $100 million in one year, decided it was again time for its employees to cash in on the company’s fast growth. The eight-year-old startup announced that its staff can sell stock at a valuation of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/dealbook/clay-start-up-tender-offers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$5 billion</a>, a more than 60% increase from its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/clay-confirms-it-closed-100m-round-at-3-1b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$3.1 billion</a> valuation announced in August.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These secondary sales at increasingly higher valuations for young, perhaps still-unproven companies may initially appear to be a premature “cash-out” reminiscent of the 2021 bubble. The most infamous example of that time was Hopin, whose founder, Johnny Boufarhat, reportedly sold $195 million worth of his company’s stock just two years before the company’s assets were sold for a <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/networking/ringcentral-to-pay-50m-for-startup-hopin-s-events-management-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tiny fraction</a> of its peak <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/hopin-ringcentral/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$7.7 billion</a> valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there is a critical distinction between the 2021 boom and today’s market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the ZIRP era, a large portion of the secondary deals provided liquidity almost exclusively to founders of buzzy companies like Hopin. In contrast, the recent transactions from Clay, Linear, and ElevenLabs are structured as tender offers that also benefit employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While investors these days largely frown upon the outsized founder payouts of the 2021 boom, the current shift toward employee-wide tender offers is viewed far more favorably.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve done a lot of tenders, and I haven’t seen any drawbacks yet,” Nick Bunick, a partner at the secondary-focused VC firm NewView Capital, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As companies stay private longer and talent competition intensifies, allowing employees to turn some of their paper gains into cash can be a powerful tool for recruiting, morale, and retention, he said. “A little liquidity is healthy, and we’ve certainly seen that across the ecosystem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of Clay’s first tender offer, co-founder Kareem Amin <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/clay-authorizes-employee-tender-at-a-1-5b-valuation-led-by-sequoia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told TechCrunch</a> that the main reason for giving employees a chance to cash out some of their otherwise-illiquid stock was to ensure that “the gains don’t just accumulate to a few people.”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some fast-growing AI startups are realizing that without offering early liquidity, they risk losing their best talent to public companies or more mature startups like OpenAI and SpaceX, which regularly offer tender sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s hard not to see the positive aspects of allowing startup employees to reap cash rewards from their hard work, Ken Sawyer, co-founder and managing partner at secondary firm Saints Capital, pointed to unintended second-order effects of employee tenders. “It is very positive for employees, of course,” he said. “But it enables companies to stay private longer, reducing liquidity for venture investors, which is a challenge for LPs.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, relying on tenders as a long-term substitute for IPOs could create a vicious cycle for the venture ecosystem. If limited partners don’t see cash returns, they will be more reluctant to back the very VC firms that invest in startups.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Launched last September, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/meta-launches-vibes-a-short-form-video-feed-of-ai-slop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vibes</a> lets you create and share short-form AI-generated videos and access a dedicated feed that displays AI videos from others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Think TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every video you come across is AI generated. Until now, the feed has lived in the Meta AI app. By making Vibes available outside of the Meta AI app, the company is positioning it as a more direct competitor to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/openais-sora-app-is-struggling-after-its-stellar-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sora, OpenAI’s AI-generated video and social app</a> that launched shortly after Vibes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@crumbler/post/DUURM5XiYLu/new-in-platformer-meta-is-testing-a-standalone-vibes-app-httpswwwplatformernewss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Platformer</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it doesn’t share specific numbers but claims Vibes has performed well, with Meta AI usage continuing to grow steadily since its launch, which it believes signals demand for a stand-alone app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tech giant also notes that while users engage with content in Meta AI, a stand-alone app allows for a more focused experience for creation and engagement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vibes lets users generate a video from scratch or remix a video that they see on their feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says collaboration and sharing are on the rise, with many Vibes videos being messaged to friends, which the company says mirrors how people use Reels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/meta-to-test-premium-subscriptions-on-instagram-facebook-and-whatsapp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meta told TechCrunch</a> last week that, in addition to testing new premium subscriptions across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it’s going to explore subscriptions for AI features, including Vibes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Vibes has been free since its launch, Meta plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. Meta plans to launch these test subscriptions in the coming months. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, is confident enough that it’s building a massive reactor that costs several hundred million dollars. But the device won’t be turned on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/commonwealth-fusion-systems-installs-reactor-magnet-lands-deal-with-nvidia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">until next year</a>, leaving the question unanswered for now.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies that were founded more recently think they have a shot at building a fusion power plant for less, including <a href=\"https://www.pacificfusion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pacific Fusion</a>. Today the company announced the results of a series of experiments it performed at Sandia National Laboratories that it says will eliminate some costly parts of its approach. The company exclusively shared the results with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion power promises to generate large amounts of electricity 24/7 and deliver it in a way that’s familiar to today’s grid operators. Most fusion startups are targeting the early to mid-2030s to switch on their first commercial fusion power plant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pacific Fusion is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/heres-how-pacific-fusion-plans-to-build-a-fusion-power-plant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">chasing an approach</a> known as pulser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF). At its core, it’s similar to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">experiments</a> carried out at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The company compresses small fuel pellets in rapid succession, and that compression causes atoms inside the fuel to fuse and release energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But where NIF uses lasers to kick off the compression, Pacific Fusion wants to use massive pulses of electricity. Those pulses will create a magnetic field that encircles the fuel pellet — about the size of a pencil eraser — causing it to compress in less than 100 billionths of a second.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The faster you can implode it, the hotter it’ll get,” Keith LeChien, co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the challenges with pulser-driven ICF is that the process has typically needed a bit of a kick-start to work properly. To create conditions in the fuel pellet hot enough for fusion, researchers have been using both lasers and magnets to warm it up beforehand. “It’s just a little bit of energy just to give it a little bit of a boost before you compress it,” LeChien said, on the order of 5% to 10% of the total energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the added lasers and magnets add upfront complexity, cost, and maintenance requirements to the machine, making it that much harder to sell power at competitive prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So in the experiments at Sandia, Pacific Fusion tweaked the design of the cylinder encasing the fuel pellet and adjusted the electrical current delivered to it. Before the big pulse of electricity that ignites the fusion reaction, the company allowed a bit of the magnetic field to leak through to the fuel before compressing it, warming it in the process. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can make very subtle changes to how this cylinder is manufactured that allow the magnetic field to leak or to seep into the fuel before it’s compressed,” LeChien said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pacific Fusion’s fuel is loaded in a plastic target that’s wrapped in aluminum. By varying the thickness of the aluminum, the company can adjust how much of the magnetic field makes its way to the fuel. The casing needs to be manufactured with some precision, but nothing crazy, LeChien said — something on the order of what’s required for a .22 caliber bullet casing. “That’s a process that’s been honed and manufactured and perfected over 100-plus years,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tweaks don’t significantly change how much energy Pacific Fusion needs to deliver to the target. “It doesn’t take much energy to actually allow that magnetic field into the center of the fuel,” he said. “It’s a tiny fraction, much less than 1%. It’s a very, very, very small fraction of the overall energy in the system, so it’s effectively unnoticeable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eliminating the magnetic system would simplify the system and its maintenance requirements, which would have a modest effect on overall cost, he said. But getting rid of the laser would cut costs significantly. “The scale of laser [needed] to preheat these types of systems at high gain is north of $100 million.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LeChien said experiments like this also help refine the company’s simulations to ensure they’re in agreement with what happens in the real world. “A lot of people have simulated things and said, ‘Oh, this will work or that will work,’” he said. “It’s a very different game to simulate something, build it, test it, and have it work. Closing that loop is hard.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration announced this week the U.S. government would work to build a $11.7 billion stockpile of critical minerals. That’s the headline; the subtext is more intriguing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stockpile initiative, branded as Project Vault, is the administration’s latest attempt to secure supplies of critical minerals for U.S. manufacturers and what President Donald Trump says will ensure “American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It follows recent investments from the administration into rare earth producers, including equity stakes in miners <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/usa-rare-earth-enters-pact-for-1-6-billion-of-federal-funds-22626027?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqeDeoStXNGzrT5S2o8Q5DS-WzddeezvmvKR4t4iGSfvIlJBcqsZEz7w&amp;gaa_ts=69823f54&amp;gaa_sig=JmZjyUCHLkSNVbGQ-wYz-q4uA3NBd_wWS5WOeEMFQKCBqbzlg9BvEpzFBIkE0YNhKnfVfCoO5oFBWSs4c0iG_A==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">USA Rare Earth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MP Materials</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Individually, they can be interpreted as an administration taking steps to calm a part of the market that has been roiled by its own trade wars. Collectively, they’re an admission, however tacit or subconscious, that the future relies on electric technologies, including electric vehicles and wind turbines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his announcement, Trump alluded to the world’s dependence on China for a slew of critical minerals. Over the last year-plus, China has wielded its dominance to counter tariff threats from the Trump administration, restricting exports of rare earth metals and lithium battery materials to the United States. Eventually, China relented, but the episode made clear who held the trump card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The spat also revealed just how integral critical minerals are to modern economies. Trump likened the new stockpile to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintained by the Department of Energy, which was set up in the wake of the oil embargo in the early 1970s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defense, we’re now creating this reserve for American industry, so we don’t have any problems,” Trump said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The oil reserve isn’t going away, but it’s not as important as it once was, diminished by productive U.S. oil wells and the increasing share of the energy market taken by solar, wind, and batteries. (Solar and wind <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2025/setting-the-scene#abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">continue to dominate</a> new electric-generating capacity, while <a href=\"https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-ev-leapfrog-how-emerging-markets-are-driving-a-global-ev-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">more than 25% of new cars</a> sold worldwide are EVs or plug-in hybrids.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear exactly which minerals will go into the reserve; Bloomberg reported that gallium and cobalt will be included. It’s possible that others like copper and nickel might get thrown in as well, though they weren’t mentioned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The size of the investment is notable. The U.S. Export-Import Bank is providing a $10 billion loan, with private capital rounding out the rest. That’s about half the value of the oil currently in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve going toward a market that’s 1% the size of the global oil market, as Bloomberg columnist David Fickling <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2026-02-03/a-12-billion-critical-minerals-reserve-promises-a-glut?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pointed out</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The mismatch is either typical Trump bluster or an acknowledgment that the market for critical minerals is going to expand significantly in the coming years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is possible it’s both, with a greater chance it is the latter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the growth in critical minerals comes from clean energy technologies and EVs; without them, the market won’t be as constrained as experts have predicted. Demand for electronics, including data centers, will play a role, but more than half of global growth in rare earth element demand is expected to come from electric vehicles and wind turbines, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/critical-minerals-data-explorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according</a> to the IEA. For cobalt and lithium, the figures are even more skewed, with EVs representing the vast majority of growth through 2050.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration hasn’t been quiet about its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/trump-doe-confirms-its-canceling-over-700m-in-manufacturing-grants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disdain</a> for clean energy technologies, preferring to bet on the status quo with fossil fuels. But the rest of the world is continuing to move toward solar, wind, and batteries, driving up demand for critical minerals. The new stockpile shows that markets can be hard to ignore.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don’t work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Called a large tabular model (LTM) rather than a large language model (LLM), Fundamental’s Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn’t rely on <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the transformer architecture</a> that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that’s within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Fraenkel sees it, that’s a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to big data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
