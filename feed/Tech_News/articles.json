Williams admitted to making more than $1.3 million in crypto from the sales between 2022 and 2025, per the Justice Department.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950140-usa-v-williams-24-doj-sentencing-memo/\">In a court document</a> published on Tuesday, federal prosecutors said Williams’ actions “directly harmed” the U.S. intelligence community by selling the hacking tools to a Russian company, which counts the Russian government among its customers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it was known that Williams sold Trenchant’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#exploit\">exploits</a> — software that takes advantage of flaws in other software usually to gain access to someone’s computer or device — prosecutors now say that these eight tools could have been used to indiscriminately enable government surveillance, cybercrime, and ransomware attacks across the globe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This latest disclosure comes ahead of Williams’ anticipated sentencing on February 24 in a Washington D.C. federal court. In its sentencing memorandum, which prosecutors use to persuade a court into handing down the maximum punishment, the Justice Department said that the exploits sold by Williams would have allowed the Russian broker and its customers to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world, including in the United States.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors asked the judge to sentence Williams to nine years in prison, with three years of supervised release, a mandatory restitution of $35 million, and a maximum fine of $250,000. Williams is expected to be deported to Australia after serving his sentence, the memorandum said. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, or about other zero-day and surveillance tech makers?

Rowley wrote in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950138-usa-v-williams-23-williams-sentencing-memo/\">response to prosecutors</a> that none of the stolen hacking tools were classified, and there was no evidence that Williams knew the tools would end up in the hands of the governments of Russia or another country. His lawyer said that Williams did not intend to harm the U.S. and his native Australia, “although he now recognizes that was a consequence of his actions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, Justice Department spokesperson Pierson Furnish declined to comment. Rowley, Williams’ attorney, did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-scapegoat-to-sentencing\">From scapegoat to sentencing</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During mid-2025, several sources with knowledge of the offensive cybersecurity industry told TechCrunch that someone working for Trenchant had stolen sensitive hacking tools and sold them to an adversary of the United States. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A former Trenchant employee came forward, telling TechCrunch that he had been wrongly fired after the company accused him of stealing and leaking details of some of the company’s exploits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But by October, prosecutors formally accused Williams, who also goes by “Doogie” and was Trenchant’s general manager at the time, of being behind the theft of the company’s hacking tools. The U.S. government charged Williams with selling the exploits to a Russian broker in exchange for crypto.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors said that FBI agents were in contact with Williams from late-2024 until the time of his arrest in mid-2025, during which he was overseeing Trenchant’s internal investigation into the theft of the company’s secrets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the ongoing investigation, Williams <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/how-an-ex-l3-harris-trenchant-boss-stole-and-sold-cyber-exploits-to-russia/\">continued to sell the company’s secrets and exploits</a> — technically known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-days</a> since the software maker affected hadn’t had time to fix them — even when he was aware that the FBI was investigating the theft and sale of Trenchant’s hacking tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Williams also oversaw the firing of the Trenchant employee accused of leaking the tools<strong>, </strong>sources told TechCrunch and prosecutors have since confirmed<strong>.</strong> The fired employee told TechCrunch that he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/apple-alerts-exploit-developer-that-his-iphone-was-targeted-with-government-spyware/\">believed he was a scapegoat</a> for someone else at the company. Weeks after his firing, the employee received a notification from Apple that he had been targeted with government spyware, which has still not been explained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Williams] stood idly by while another employee of the company was essentially blamed for the Defendant’s own conduct,” the prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum. “He looked on while an internal corporate investigation falsely cast blame on his subordinate.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for Trenchant did not respond to a request for comment about Williams or its investigation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was only on August 6 when FBI agents obtained and executed search warrants for William’s home, and then confronted Williams with evidence that showed receipts of crypto payments, the alias he used to interact with the Russian broker that purchased the stolen trade secrets, and his contract with the broker. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Russian broker is likely Operation Zero, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/russian-zero-day-seller-offers-20m-for-hacking-android-and-iphones/\">which offers up to $20 million for tools to hack into Android devices and iPhones</a>. The company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/\">explicitly says</a> it only sells to the Russian government and local organizations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero did not return a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors called the broker, which it did not name, “one of the world’s most nefarious exploit brokers,” and said that Williams chose it because, “by his own admission, he knew they paid the most.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Williams’ “desire for more money, a better lifestyle, bigger home and more jewels and trinkets simply could not be satiated, and he chose to risk it all to betray his company, his colleagues, and the United States and its allies to satisfy that desire,” the prosecutors wrote.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Elon Musk and his coterie have been talking about AI in space for years—mainly in the context of Iain Banks’ science fiction series about a far-future universe where sentient spaceships roam and control the galaxy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Musk sees an opportunity to realize a version of this vision. His company SpaceX has requested regulatory permission to build solar-powered orbital data centers, distributed across as many as a million satellites, that could shift as much as 100 GW of compute power off the planet. He has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/elon-musk-lunar-factory.html\">reportedly</a> suggested some of his AI satellites will be built on the Moon.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By far the cheapest place to put AI will be space in 36 months or less,” Musk said last week on a podcast hosted by Stripe cofounder John Collison. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’s not alone. xAI’s head of compute has reportedly bet his counterpart at Anthropic that 1% of global compute will be in orbit by 2028. Google (which has a significant ownership stake in SpaceX) has announced a space AI effort called Project Suncatcher, which will launch prototype vehicles in 2027. Starcloud, a start-up that has raised $34 million backed by Google and Andreessen Horowitz, filed its own plans for an 80,000 satellite constellation last week. Even Jeff Bezos has said this is the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But behind the hype, what will it actually take to get data centers into space? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a first analysis, today’s terrestrial data centers remain cheaper than those in orbit. Andrew McCalip, a space engineer, has built a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://andrewmccalip.com/space-datacenters\">helpful calculator</a> comparing the two models. His baseline results show that a 1 Gw orbital data center might cost $42.4B—almost three times its ground-bound equivalent, thanks to the up-front costs of building the satellites and launching them to orbit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Changing that equation, experts say, will require technology development across several fields, massive capital expenditure, and a lot of work on the supply chain for space-grade components. It also depends on costs on the ground rising as resources and supply chains are strained by growing demand.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-designing-and-launching-the-satellites\">Designing and launching the satellites</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The key driver for any space business model is how much it costs to get anything up there. Musk’s SpaceX is already pushing down on the cost of getting to orbit, but analysts looking at what it will take to make orbital data centers a reality need even lower prices to close their business case. In other words, while AI data centers may seem to be a story about a new business line ahead of the SpaceX IPO, the plan depends on completing the company’s longest-running unfinished project—Starship. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Consider that the reusable Falcon 9 delivers, today, a cost to orbit of roughly $3,600/kg. Making space data centers doable, per Project Suncatcher’s white paper, will require prices closer to $200/kg, an 18-fold improvement which it expects to be available in the 2030s. At that price, however, the energy delivered by a Starlink satellite today would be cost competitive with a terrestrial datacenter. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expectation is that SpaceX’s next-generation Starship rocket will deliver those improvements—no other vehicle in development promises equivalent savings. However, that vehicle has yet to become operational or even reach orbit; a third iteration of Starship is expected to make its maiden launch sometime in the months ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Starship is completely successful, however, assumptions that it will immediately deliver lower prices to customers may not pass the smell test. Economists at the consultancy Rational Futures make a compelling case that, as with the Falcon 9, SpaceX will not want to charge much less than its best competitor—otherwise the company is leaving money on the table. If Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, for example, retails at $70 million, SpaceX won’t take on Starship missions for external customers at much less than that, which would leave it above the numbers publicly assumed by space data center builders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are not enough rockets to launch a million satellites yet, so we’re pretty far from that,” Matt Gorman, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, said at a recent event. “If you think about the cost of getting a payload in space today, it’s massive. It is just not economical.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, if launch is the bane of all space businesses, the second challenge is production cost. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We always take for granted, at this point, that Starship’s cost is going to be hundreds of dollars per kilo,” McCalip told TechCrunch. “People are not taking into account the satellites are almost $1,000 a kilo right now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Satellite manufacturing costs are the largest chunk of that price tag, but if high-powered satellites can be made at about half the cost of current Starlink satellites, the numbers start to make sense. SpaceX has made great advances in satellite economics while building Starlink, its record-setting communications network, and the company hopes to achieve more through scale. Part of the reasoning behind a million satellites is undoubtedly the cost savings that come from mass production. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the satellites that will be used for these missions must be large enough to satisfy the complex requirements for operating powerful GPUs, including large solar arrays, thermal management systems, and laser-based communications links to receive and deliver data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19468\">2025 white paper</a> from Project Suncatcher offers one way to compare terrestrial and space data centers by the cost of power, the basic input needed to run chips. On the ground, data centers spend roughly $570–3,000 for a Kw of power over a year, depend on local power costs and the efficiency of their systems. SpaceX’s Starlink satellites get their power from on-board solar panels instead, but the cost of acquiring, launching, and maintaining those spacecraft delivers energy at $14,700 per Kw over a year. Put simply, satellites and their components will have to get a lot cheaper before they’re cost-competitive with metered power.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-space-environment-is-not-fooling-around\">The space environment is not fooling around</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Orbital data center proponents often say that thermal management is “free” in space, but that’s an oversimplification. Without an atmosphere, it’s actually more difficult to disperse heat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re relying on very large radiators to just be able to dissipate that heat into the blackness of space, and so that’s a lot of surface area and mass that you have to manage,” said Mike Safyan, an executive at Planet Labs, which is building prototype satellites for Google Suncatcher that are expected to launch in 2027. “It is recognized as one of the key challenges, especially long term.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Besides the vacuum of space, AI satellites will need to deal with cosmic radiation as well. Cosmic rays degrade chips over time, and they can also cause “bit flip” errors that can corrupt data. Chips can be protected with shielding, use rad-hardened components, or work in series with redundant error checks, but all these options involve expensive trades for mass. Still, Google used a particle beam to test the effects of radiation on its Tensor Processing Units (chips designed explicitly for machine learning applications). SpaceX executives said on social media that the company has acquired a particle accelerator for just that purpose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another challenge comes from the solar panels themselves. The logic of the project is energy arbitrage: Putting solar panels in space makes them anywhere from five to eight times more efficient than on Earth, and if they’re in the right orbit, they can be in sight of the sun for 90% of the day or more, increasing their efficiency. Electricity is the main fuel for chips, so more energy = cheaper data centers. But even solar panels are more complicated in space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Space-rated solar panels made of rare earth elements are hardy, but too expensive. Solar panels made from silicon are cheap and increasingly prevalent in space—Starlink and Amazon Kuiper use them—but they degrade much faster due to space radiation. That will limit the lifetime of AI satellites to around five years, which means they will have to generate return on investment faster. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, some analysts think that’s not such a big deal, based on how quickly new generations of chips arrive on the scene. “After five or six years, the dollars per kilowatt hour doesn’t produce a return, and that’s because they’re not state of the art,” Philip Johnston, the CEO of Starcloud, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Danny Field, an executive at Solestial, a start-up building space-rated silicon solar panels, says the industry sees orbital data centers as a key driver of growth. He’s speaking with several companies about potential data center projects, and says “any player who is big enough to dream is at least thinking about it.” As a long-time spacecraft design engineer, however, he doesn’t discount the challenges in these models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can always extrapolate physics out to a bigger size,” Field said. “I’m excited to see how some of these companies get to a point where the economics make sense and the business case closes.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-do-space-data-centers-fit-in\">How do space data centers fit in?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One outstanding question about these data centers: What will we do with them? Are they general purpose, or for inference, or for training? Based on existing use cases, they may not be entirely interchangeable with data centers on the ground. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A key challenge for training new models is operating thousands of GPUs together <em>en masse. </em>Most model training is not distributed, but done in individual data centers. The hyperscalers are working to change this in order to increase the power of their models, but it still hasn’t been achieved. Similarly, training in space will require coherence between GPUs on multiple satellites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team at Google’s Project Suncatcher notes that the company’s terrestrial data centers connect their TPU networks with throughput in the hundreds of gigabpits per second. The fastest off-the-shelf inter-satellite comms links today, which use lasers, can only get up to about 100 Gbps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That led to an intriguing architecture for Suncatcher: It involves flying 81 satellites in formation so they are close enough to use the kind of transceivers relied on by terrestrial data centers. That, of course, presents its own challenges: The autonomy required to ensure each spacecraft remains in its correct station, even if maneuvers are required to avoid orbital debris or another spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the Google study offers a caveat: The work of inference can tolerate the orbital radiation environment, but more research is needed to understand the potential impact of bit-flips and other errors on training workloads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inference tasks don’t have the same need for thousands of GPUs working in unison. The job can be done with dozens of GPUs, perhaps on a single satellite, an architecture that represents a kind of minimum viable product and the likely starting point for the orbital data center business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Training is not the ideal thing to do in space,” Johnston said. “I think almost all inference workloads will be done in space,” imagining everything from customer service voice agents to ChatGPT queries being computed in orbit. He says his company’s first AI satellite is already earning revenue performing inference in orbit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While details are scarce even in the company’s FCC filing, SpaceX’s orbital data center constellation seems to anticipate about 100 kw of compute power per ton28, roughly twice the power of current Starlink satellites. The spacecraft will operate in connection with each other and using the Starlink network to share information; the filing claims that Starlink’s laser links can achieve petabit-level throughput. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For SpaceX, the company’s recent acquisition of xAI (which is building its own terrestrial data centers) will let the company stake out positions in both terrestrial and orbital data centers, seeing which supply chain adapts faster.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s the benefit of having fungible Floating Point Operations Per Second – if you can make it work. “A FLOP is a FLOP, it doesn’t matter where it lives,” McCalip said. “[SpaceX] can just scale until [it] hits permitting or capex bottlenecks on the ground, and then fall back to [their] space deployments.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents about SpaceX?

The platform’s new “Dear Algo” feature lets users tell Threads what they temporarily want to see more or less of in their feed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use the feature, users need to type “Dear Algo” in a public Threads post, followed by what they’d like to see more or less of. For example, if you want to see more content about popular podcasts, you can post “Dear algo, show me more posts about podcasts.” Your feed will be adjusted for three days after submitting a request.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s worth noting that because Dear Algo works through public postings, others are able to see your request, and they can even repost your request to apply it to their own feed. This aspect of the feature may be a hindrance for some users, as they might not want their requests to be public. However, Meta says it views this as a way for users to discover new conversations and topics, turning personalization into a community experience.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091671\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png 3158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Threads_Dear-Algo_Post-Activity-Feed.png?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By allowing users to temporarily influence what appears on their feeds, Threads gains an edge over its competitors by offering a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Threads is where you go to keep up with what’s happening right now,” the company wrote in a blog post. “But sometimes, what matters to you changes in an instant, and you want your Threads feed to reflect that — whether it’s seeing more posts during a live NBA game or less about a TV show you haven’t caught up on yet.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Threads and its competitors, X and Bluesky, already offer users a simple way to indicate their preferences with a ‘Not Interested’ button, the new Dear Algo feature takes personalization a step further.

With Android 16’s release last year, Google adopted <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/google-ships-first-developer-preview-android-16-to-speed-up-feature-roll-outs/\">a two-release structure</a> in a calendar year with a major SDK release in the first half and a minor SDK release in the second half of the year. The company made this move to give time to device makers to roll out the latest version more quickly to devices and reduce fragmentation in the Android ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Android 17 will restrict developers from opting out of resizing restrictions. This means developers can’t force and orietnation or resizing on large-screen devices.

After a long stretch on GitHub Copilot, Silver is now a corporate vice president at Microsoft’s CoreAI division, where she works on tools for deploying apps and agentic systems within enterprises. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her work is focused on <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Foundry system</a> inside Azure, which is designed as a unified AI portal for enterprises, giving her a close view of how companies are actually using these systems and where deployments end up falling short.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I spoke with Silver about the current capabilities of enterprise agents, and why she believes this is the biggest opportunity for startups since the public cloud.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This interview was edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>So, your work focuses on Microsoft products for outside developers — often startups that aren’t otherwise focused on AI. How do you see AI impacting those companies?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I see this as being a watershed moment for startups as profound as the move to the public cloud. If you think about it, the cloud had a huge impact for startups because it meant that they no longer needed to have the real estate space to host their racks, and they didn’t need to spend as much money on the capital infusion of getting the hardware to be hosted in their labs and things like that. Everything became cheaper. Now agentic AI is going to kind of continue to reduce the overall cost of software operations again, because many of the jobs involved in standing up a new venture — whether it’s support people, legal investigations — a lot of it can be done faster and cheaper with AI agents. I think that’s going to lead to more ventures and more startups launching. And then we’re going to see higher-valuation startups with fewer people at the helm. And I think that that’s an exciting world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What does that look like in practice?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are certainly seeing multistep agents becoming very broadly used across all different kinds of coding tasks, right? Just as an example, one thing developers have to do to maintain a codebase is stay current with the latest versions of the libraries that it has a dependency on. You might have a dependency on an older version of the dot-net runtime or the Java SDK. And we can have these agentic systems reason over your entire codebase and bring it up to date much more easily, with maybe a 70% or 80% reduction of the time it takes. And it really has to be a deployed multistep agent to do that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Live-site operations is another one — if you think of maintaining a website or a service and something goes wrong, there’s a thud in the night, and somebody has to be on call to get woken up to go respond to the incident. We still do have people on call 24/7, just in case the service goes down. But it used to be a really loathed job because you’d get woken up fairly often for these minor incidents. And we’ve now built a genetic system to successfully diagnose and in many cases fully mitigate issues that come up in these live site operations so that humans don’t have to be woken up in the middle of the night and groggily go to their terminals and try to diagnose what’s going on. And that also helps us dramatically reduce the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>One of the other puzzles of this present moment is that agentic deployments haven’t happened quite as fast as we expected even six months ago. I’m curious why you think that is.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you think about the people who are building agents, what is preventing them from being successful, in many cases, it comes down to not really knowing what the purpose of the agent should be. There’s a culture change that has to happen in how people build these systems. What is the business use case that they are trying to solve for? What are they trying to achieve? You need to be very clear-eyed about what the definition of success is for this agent. And you need to think, what is the data that I’m giving to the agent so that it can reason over how to go accomplish this particular task?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We see those things as the bigger stumbling blocks, more than the general uncertainty of letting agents get deployed. Anybody who goes and looks at these systems sees the return on investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>You mention the general uncertainty, which I think feels like a big blocker from the outside. Why do you see it as less of a problem in practice?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First of all, I think that it’s going to be very common that agentic systems have human-in-the-loop scenarios. Think about something like a package return. It used to be that you would have a workflow for the return processing that was 90% automated and 10% human intervention, where somebody would have to go look at the package and have to make a judgment call as to how damaged the package was before they would decide to accept the return. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a perfect example where actually now the computer vision models are getting so good that in many cases, we don’t need to have as much human oversight over inspecting the package and making that determination. There will still be some cases that are borderline, where maybe the computer vision is not yet good enough to make a call, and maybe there’s an escalation. It’s kind of like, how often do you need to call in the manager? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some things that will always need some kind of human oversight, because they’re such critical operations. Think about incurring a contractual legal obligation, or deploying code into a production codebase that could potentially affect the reliability of your systems. But even then, there’s the question of how far we could get in automating the rest of the process.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/upscrolleds-founder-says-the-social-network-has-zoomed-past-2-5m-users/\">growing to more than 2.5 million users</a> in January, users have reported the app is not taking action on the creation of usernames and hashtags that contain racial slurs, and hasn’t been able to properly moderate harmful content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After receiving tips from UpScrolled users, TechCrunch confirmed the existence of a wide range of racial slurs and hate speech being used in people’s usernames on the app. For instance, some usernames would feature the name of the slur itself, the slur combined with other words, or multiple slurs in a single username; other usernames contain hate speech, like “Glory to Hitler.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After reporting these slurs to UpScrolled’s public email address, we received a response from that email that the company is “actively reviewing and removing inappropriate content,” and is working to expand its moderation capacity. The email advised us not to engage with bad-faith actors while the situation is resolved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Days after reporting this activity on the app, the accounts with slurs in the usernames that were provided to UpScrolled via screenshots remained online. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, slurs and hate speech can be found elsewhere in the app, including hashtags and text used alongside its photo or video content, TechCrunch found. Other harmful content was available, including text posts with racial slurs and hate speech, and photo and video content glorifying Hitler, based on TechCrunch’s review of the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch wasn’t alone in identifying this problem; the ADL also <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/article/upscrolled-social-media-platform-attracts-virulent-antisemites-lacks-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published a blog post this month</a>, noting that UpScrolled was becoming home to antisemitic and extremist content and <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">designated</a> foreign terrorist organizations, like Hamas and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">UpScrolled, which was founded in 2025, claims on its website claims that the platform offers every voice “equal power.” The app has seen more than 4 million downloads on iOS and Android since June 2025, according to market intelligence provider <a href=\"https://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Appfigures</a> — a figure even higher than the startup’s self-reported number last month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while UpScrolled’s <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/faq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">FAQ</a> explains the app doesn’t “censor opinions,” it does indicate that its <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/rules-and-policies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">policy</a> is to restrict content that involves “illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That guidance is similar to most modern-day social media platforms. It’s clear, however, that the company is struggling to enforce its rules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s battle that social networks are often faced with — especially those that receive a large influx of new users in a short time period. Bluesky, for instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/bluesky-racial-slurs-banned-list-usernames/\">faced issues with slurs in account usernames in July 2023</a>, which led to users threatening to leave the site.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After UpScrolled’s initial reply to our inquiry, TechCrunch also received a response from the press account on Tuesday, which directed us to UpScrolled founder <a href=\"https://x.com/iHijazi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Issam Hijazi’s</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2021183174802280576\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new video</a>, where he addressed the issues with content moderation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the <a href=\"https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2021183174802280576\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">video</a>, he confirmed that users have been uploading “harmful content” that goes against UpScrolled’s terms of service and the company’s beliefs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are offering everyone the freedom to express and share their opinions in a healthy and respectful digital environment,” Hijazi said. To create that environment, he said the company is “rapidly expanding our content moderation team, and we are upgrading our technology infrastructure so we can catch and remove harmful content more effectively.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

More than half of xAI’s founding team has now left, and the fact that several employees followed within days has intensified scrutiny around the company’s stability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Three of the departing staff members say they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others hint at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, <a href=\"https://x.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/2021113745024614671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a post</a> announcing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shayan Salehian, who worked on product infrastructure and model behavior post-training at xAI and previously worked at Twitter/X, <a href=\"https://x.com/shayan_/status/2020240890233807232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said last week</a> he was leaving to “start something new.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Valid Kazemi, who had a brief stint working on machine learning, <a href=\"https://x.com/vahidk/status/2021392140933402976?s=46&amp;t=Epl8sTZrKzZ5ctcw3cgciw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted Tuesday</a> that he left a few weeks ago, adding: “IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring … So, I’m starting something new.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roland Gavrilescu, a former xAI engineer, left in November to start Nuraline, a company building “forward-deployed AI agents,” but posted again on Tuesday that he left the firm to build “something new with others that left xAI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The departures come at a moment of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/among-the-worst-weve-seen-report-slams-xais-grok-over-child-safety-failures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">significant controversy</a> for xAI. The company is facing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">regulatory scrutiny</a> after Grok created nonconsensual explicit deepfakes of women and children that were disseminated on X — <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/paris-prosecutors-raid-x-offices-as-part-of-investigation-over-child-abuse-images-deepfakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">French authorities last week raided X</a> offices as part of an investigation. The company is also moving toward a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">planned IPO </a>later this year, after being <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legally acquired by SpaceX</a> last week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk is also facing personal controversy after files published by the Justice Department show extended conversations with convicted rapist and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The emails show Musk <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/expressed-interest-visiting-jeffrey-epstein-island-emails-show-doj-rcna256784\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discussing a visit to Epstein’s island</a> on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013. Epstein was first convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2008.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI maintains a headcount of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-org-chart-employees-elon-musk-direct-reports-2025-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 1,000 employees</a>, so the departures are unlikely to affect the company’s short-term capabilities. Still, the rapid pace of the recent departures has taken on a life of its own online, with users jokingly announcing they too are “leaving xAI” despite never having worked there — a sign of how quickly the narrative of a “mass exodus” has snowballed on Musk’s X.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, co-founder exits are harder to dismiss as routine churn. As Musk continues to consolidate his AI ambitions, their departures raise broader questions about governance and long-term stability at xAI. In frontier AI, where talent is scarce, qualities like reputational gravity and mission clarity matter. The more pressing question may not be how many engineers have left, but whether xAI can maintain the institutional steadiness needed to compete with rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-timeline-of-departure-announcements\">Timeline of departure announcements</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The following employees have publicly announced their departures from xAI on X in recent days:</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>February 6:  </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/ayushjaiswal/status/2019857451823296876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ayush Jaiswal</a>, engineer, wrote: “This was my last week at xAI.

The NIF is the site of the world’s only controlled fusion reactions <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/17/laser-powered-fusion-experiment-more-than-doubles-its-power-output/\">that have reached scientific breakeven</a>, in which the reaction releases more energy than it took to start. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series A was led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from GV, Modern Capital, Threshold Ventures, and others. Inertia’s co-founders include Jeff Lawson, who co-founded Twilio and serves as its CEO; Annie Kritcher, who led the successful experiments at NIF; and Mike Dunne, a Stanford professor who helped Lawrence Livermore develop a power plant design based on NIF. Kritcher has remained in her position at Lawrence Livermore.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NIF’s breakeven experiments have been a key milestone on the road to widespread fusion power. However, considerable progress needs to be made before a fusion power plant can deliver electricity to the grid. For Inertia, that means building a laser capable of delivering 10 kilojoules 10 times per second.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s reactor relies on a form of fusion known as inertial confinement. In Inertia’s flavor of inertial confinement, lasers bombard a fuel target, compressing the fuel until atoms inside fuse and release energy. The technique is based on NIF’s designs, in which laser light is converted into X-rays inside the target. The X-rays are what ultimately heat and compress the fuel pellet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each of Inertia’s power plants will require 1,000 of its lasers bombarding 4.5 mm targets that cost less than $1 each to mass produce. By contrast, the NIF’s system uses 192 lasers to fire on <a href=\"https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/keys-to-success/targets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">painstakingly crafted</a> targets that take dozens of hours to make. Inertia is betting that by using the same basic principles as NIF and applying a more commercial mindset, it can bring the costs down dramatically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inertia’s new round is the latest in a string of funding announcements from fusion startups in recent months. With this round and others, fusion startups have attracted more than $10 billion in investments. And at least a dozen companies have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/%5D/\">raised more than $100 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, Avalanche said it had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/avalanche-thinks-the-fusion-power-industry-should-think-smaller/\">raised $29 million to advance its desktop-sized fusion reactor</a>.

Last summer, Commonwealth Fusion Systems <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">raised $863 million from dozens of investors</a>, including Google, Nvidia, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two fusion companies recently announced they were going public via reverse mergers.

The startup has been quietly testing its AI sales platform through a private beta for a while, but on Wednesday opened it up to a public beta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The well-connected Blond brothers (Sam was previously head of sales at Brex), also attracted a bunch of big-name angels as backers: Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Y Combinator chief Garry Tan, and Greenoaks Capital founder Neil Mehta.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what attracted such a venerable list of investors? Monaco is entering the crowded field of AI sales tech with a twist. It isn’t just competing with SaaS-era tech via its AI-native alternative; it’s also supplying experienced human salespeople to be experts in the AI loop, monitoring and guiding the AI’s work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is targeting young seed and Series A-level startups with a product suite that includes an AI-native customer relationship management (CRM) system and a built-from-scratch ZoomInfo-like database for finding prospects. Its AI agents can create and execute email outreach campaigns and draft follow-up emails all monitored by the human experts. It includes other features, too, like a meeting notetaker. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The product is intended to automate much of the sales grunt work. “We can replace full workflows with agents,” Blond says (pictured above, third from left, with brother Brian, pictured second from left). For instance, Monaco builds a database of prospects, identifies the exact people at a target company to pitch, and the sequence in which to target them. “We orchestrate and execute that sequence. We schedule a meeting,” Blond says. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The human-in-the-loop salespeople help ensure that the AI isn’t hallucinating and train it to sell the product, and the actual customer meetings are done by the people. No avatars. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That makes Monaco a rare AI sales startup that isn’t <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\">talking about</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/6sense-founder-amanda-kahlow-raises-30-million-for-new-human-replacement-ai-sales-startup-1mind/\">human replacement</a>. Instead, it’s making experienced salespeople available to companies too nascent to hire them directly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s this combination of the technology, but also the service,” Blond says. “Monaco does not have an agent pretending to be a sales rep trying to sell to the customer.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Monaco’s main competition is HubSpot, priced as it is to be more affordable for young companies than the big kahuna of the market, Salesforce. Blond declined to tell us what Monaco will charge, except to say that it’s a flat fee and currently discounted while the product remains in beta.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’s also well aware that he’s in an exceptionally crowded market. Y Combinator alone has graduated hundreds of sales startups in the past couple of years, ranging from AI CRMs to niche AI tools. Then there’s startups like Attio, Clay, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/how-2-uc-berkeley-dropouts-raised-28m-for-their-ai-marketing-automation-startup/\">Conversion,</a> and the crop of so-called AI SDR (sales-development representative) tools — human-replacement agentic startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/11x-ceo-hasan-sukkar-steps-down/\">11x</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/yes-linkedin-banned-ai-agent-startup-artisan-but-now-its-back/\">Artisan</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/6sense-founder-amanda-kahlow-raises-30-million-for-new-human-replacement-ai-sales-startup-1mind/\">1mind</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, the incumbents, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, and ZoomInfo, are all offering their own AI and agentic tools.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blond points out that today’s top players were built in another era, and none of the upstarts are performing well enough to be a clear-cut winner. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There definitely is not the ‘Cursor for sales’,” he says, referring to the popular AI coding tool. “But there will be.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He obviously wants Monaco to be that winner. “In the broad category of sales technology, there’s a market leader right now. That market leader is Salesforce,” Blond says. “We are in the early innings of the next platform shift that will lead to a new market leader.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, out of all the areas he could have entered after leaving Founders Fund, why duke it out among so much competition?  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blond, speaking earnestly, says that having spent his entire career in sales, “As a non-technical founder, there’s really only one type of technology company that I’m qualified to be the founder of: a sales technology company.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He’s clearly having fun doing so. The company employs about 40 people and the office, filled with fellow career salespeople, sports WWII-esque motivational posters on the wall with slogans like “Save Startups” and “Build the future with Monaco.” There’s even an office gong that rings out every time the AI lands a meeting with a prospect. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Less than a year later, they were sleeping in a camper on the side of a Canadian corn field building their robotics startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waterloo, Ontario-based Upside Robotics builds lightweight solar-powered autonomous robots that deliver right-sized amounts of fertilizer and nutrients to crops when they need it. The company’s software runs on proprietary algorithms to decipher when and how much fertilizer the plants need using weather and soil data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upside’s robots currently work on corn plants — one of the most fertilizer-intensive crops — which was chosen by Upside for that exact reason, Jana Tian, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After Tian and Sam Dugan, co-founder and chief technology officer, met at the Entrepreneurs First accelerator, they decided to focus on reducing fertilizer waste using robots because it fit squarely into the center of the Venn diagram of their interests. It also leaned well toward their backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dugan had been building robots since he was 10 years old and Tian had years of experience as a chemical engineer in the food division at Unilever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customer discovery with farmers further confirmed this was an area farmers were willing to pay for a better way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Traditionally, the way the fertilizer has been applied, only 30% of the total fertilizer gets taken by the crop, so a majority of it gets wasted,” Tian said. “Farmers usually do one application per season, so they have to front-load a lot of the fertilizer. But the crops need the fertilizer during the season as well. We knew there was that problem that a lot of our growers really wanted different solutions to.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?w=532\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091874\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg 1603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=117,150 117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=235,300 235w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=768,981 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=532,680 532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=939,1200 939w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=1002,1280 1002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=337,430 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=564,720 564w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=704,900 704w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=626,800 626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=1202,1536 1202w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=523,668 523w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=294,375 294w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=483,617 483w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=416,531 416w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/upside-founders.jpeg?resize=39,50 39w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Tian and Dugan</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Courtesy of Upside Robotics</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pair formally founded Upside Robotics in 2024 and then hit the fields — literally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We actually bought a camper trailer, and we moved around field to field,” Dugan said. “We stayed on the side of the field every night, and we would be walking, sometimes around the clock. We have spent every hour of the day in a corn field at some point in time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dugan built a robot in two weeks so they could start to test their idea. This device was a remote-controlled car that Dugan and Tian would operate manually. They’d follow the robot around the fields to collect data and demonstrate how the fertilizing system would work to farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We did our manual applications in year one, and that allowed us to iterate super fast, not just kind of on the hardware side, but learning by being with the farmers,” Tian said. “Some of our farmers said that we spent probably more time than they did in a lifetime in their fields. That allowed us to wrap up quickly. Neither of us were farmers, so that gave us firsthand experience into what it is like to basically be a farmer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After spending the 2024 season proving the company’s concept, they spent that off-season developing the fourth generation of their robot for the 2025 growing season. They went from 70 acres in 2024 to 1,200 acres in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company is gearing up to serve more than 3,000 acres in the upcoming 2026 season with 100% customer retention since the beginning. Upside reported that it has thus far helped its customers cut fertilizer use by 70%, which equates to around $150 in savings per acre per season.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Upside recently raised a $7.5 million seed round led by Plural with participation from Garage Capital and the founders of <a href=\"https://clearpathrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Clearpath Robotics</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding will be used to continue to fund research and development and to keep up with demand — there are more than 200 farms on their waitlist. The company also hopes to expand out of Canada with a target of breaking into the U.S. corn belt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People always question if farmers are going to adopt new solutions, and they certainly are, and that’s something that we’ve learned firsthand, as long as you can provide them with a clear [return on investment] and a clear reason of why this technology was built,” Tian said. “In our case, it wasn’t something that we actually had to sell to farmers. In a lot of cases, our farmers actually asked for this solution.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TikTok-Local-Feed.jpg?resize=1200,655",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok on Wednesday announced the launch of a new “Local Feed” in the U.S. version of the app, which displays content related to travel, news, events, shopping, and dining near the user’s current location. The feed’s arrival comes shortly after a change in TikTok’s terms of service under the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-finalizes-deal-to-create-new-us-entity-and-avoid-ban/\">new U.S. joint venture</a>, which said that the app would begin to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\">collect precise location information</a> from TikTok users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, TikTok confirms the reason it’s now asking for more accurate location information is to help power the Local Feed. However, it notes that users will be able to control whether or not precise location sharing is on, and the default will be set to “off,” making this an opt-in experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Local Feed had rolled out in December to select European markets, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/tiktok-rolls-out-a-nearby-feed-to-display-local-content-in-select-countries/\">including</a> the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company explains in its <a href=\"https://usdsjv.tiktok.com/Introducing-the-Local-Feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcement</a> that the feed is meant to help users stay connected to their local community, and its posts are shown to people based on their location, the content’s topic, and when the content was posted. This makes it a more current feed of local information — like suggestions of new restaurants to try, local events, shopping suggestions, and more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature also ties into TikTok’s push to attract small businesses to its app, not only as content producers but as advertisers. This could help insulate it against further regulation and help it to claim, as Meta does, that it should not be reigned in because so many <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/04/hoping-to-stall-a-ban-tiktok-says-it-generated-14-7b-for-us-small-businesses-last-year/\">small businesses rely on its services</a> to reach their customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok notes that 7.5 million businesses currently use the app to reach global customers, and these businesses support more than 28 million workers, per a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/oxford-economics-us-jobs-impact-report?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2025 Oxford Economics report</a>. The company also highlighted figures from the <a href=\"https://sbecouncil.org/2025/11/27/the-tiktok-boost-to-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council</a>, which found that 84% of TikTok small business users said the platform helped grow their business, and 75% said TikTok helped them reach customers beyond their local area. In addition, another 74% said TikTok helps them connect with their local community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As TikTok sees it, the Local Feed will help generate real-world traffic and sales for these brick-and-mortar stores across the U.S.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3091884\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg 2132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=1200,678 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=1280,723 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=430,243 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=720,407 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=800,452 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=1536,867 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=2048,1157 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=664,375 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=1093,617 1093w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=708,400 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tiktok-local-feed-us.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TikTok</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first time users access the Local Feed, they’ll be prompted to allow the app to use their location data. On iOS, for example, the pop-up request will allow users to pick whether they want to allow the activity once or while using the app or not at all. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,” the company writes in its announcement. However, TikTok would have likely seen a better reception to this feature had it rolled out the request for precise location data before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-finalizes-deal-to-create-new-us-entity-and-avoid-ban/\">its ownership transition in the U.S.</a>, or at least at the same time. That way, the app could at least point to a reason as to why it wanted to collect this additional data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, even if the location data now has a purpose, it’s worth considering whether or not the value of a local feed is worth the privacy risk. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok also notes that the feature will be available only to users 18 and older and will only collect information while the app is in use.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The bottleneck was always the same — most project management tools like Atlassian’s Jira and Asana simply weren’t secure enough to meet the government’s strict security standards.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, in early 2022, Conafay launched <a href=\"https://integrate.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Integrate</a>, a collaboration platform designed specifically to allow private companies, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other government agencies to work jointly on classified, multi-entity projects. Last year, the Seattle-based startup won a <a href=\"https://integrate.co/blog/u-s-space-force-awards-25m-contract-to-integrate-for-program-execution-modernization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$25 million</a>, five-year contract from the U.S. Space Force.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That validation from a major agency was one of the reasons Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, just led Integrate’s $17 million Series A. Chan, known for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/02/wesley-chan-venture-capital-unicorn/\">early bets</a> on Canva, Robinhood, Plaid, and more than 20 other unicorns, told TechCrunch he invested because Integrate solves a big problem for the government and the private companies that serve it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until recently, the tech sector shunned selling to the U.S. Department of Defense, feeling that it was immoral to create products for the military. But that sentiment changed after Russia invaded Ukraine and China began to be viewed as an adversary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This shift also means other project management companies may now want to sell their products to the government, but Conafay claims it will be technically difficult for them to catch up to Integrate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you don’t build something from the ground up with government requirements, you can’t really go back and re-architect software that exists for government purposes,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Conafay, what sets Integrate apart from its civilian-focused competitors is its ability to let different organizations simultaneously and securely collaborate on massive project schedules while keeping sensitive details hidden from other participants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Integrate is designed to handle the coordination of mammoth, multi-year mega-projects, such as the F-35 Lightning II program or the James Webb Space Telescope, where thousands of partners must stay in sync, Conafay explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While he was careful not to reveal too much about customers besides the Space Force, he did say that some of the work the startup is doing for that branch of U.S. military involves deployments of large rockets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They have to coordinate tens of satellites on a single launch across dozens of missions,” Conafay said. “The complexity is pretty extreme, and they use us to coordinate those things.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Integrate intends to grow by selling its software to other branches of the U.S. military, including the Navy, the Army, and the intelligence community, as well as to the private companies that serve them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At parties, for example, she’s the one helping people with their phone privacy configurations. “It got to a point where I realized the best way to actually protect consumer data is to help secure the enterprises that hold the world’s data.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So she launched a company called <a href=\"https://www.complyance.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Complyance</a> to do just that. On Wednesday, the company announced a $20 million Series A led by GV. Complyance is an app that companies integrate into their existing tech stack. It uses AI agents to help them manage governance, risk, and, well, data compliance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AI basically automates a number of manual tasks,” Kaul said. “It uses AI to do custom checks on data coming in against their own specific criteria and risk thresholds.” The AI then flags any risks that need review. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These risk reviews can take weeks or months when done manually. It’s a standard audit-based process that happens perhaps once a year or once a quarter, where teams will run a check on their organization. Tools like Complyance hope to make this process more efficient by using technology to run continuous checks in seconds, so companies never have to wonder if they are in data compliance. It also has an agent that assesses the risk of any third-party vendors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re trying to redefine what enterprise GRC teams spend their time doing right now,” she said, adding that it’s usually chasing down mundane tasks. GRC refers to governance, risk, and compliance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in the market include Archer, ServiceNow GRC, and OneTrust. She said her company differs from incumbents because it is AI-native, rather than layering AI features on top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kaul declined to say how many customers the company has, but noted that it works with a few Fortune 500 companies. Complyance has raised $28 million in funding to date. Though the company came out of stealth in 2023, its first product didn’t go to market until the end of 2024. Kaul called fundraising “kind of a fairy tale,” because GV actually approached her.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’ve been looking for an enterprise-grade AI-led product in the space that was winning over enterprise clients, and we were doing that,” Kaul said.

Now it has raised another $520 million from earlier investors Google, Mercedes-Benz, and B Capital, alongside some new investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it may sound like the startup is just selling off ever bigger chunks of itself at its Series A price, that’s not exactly what’s happening. The company says its investors have paid progressively more for shares in each subsequent extension — valuing it at roughly triple the initial Series A valuation of around $1.75 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why not just call this a Series B then? The company says it is still in early stages of development and was not actively seeking funding —  rather it was dealing with inbound interest, says a source close to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fair enough. Another $520 million in a year, especially at a higher valuation, would be hard to turn away, particularly for tech as expensive to build as bipedal robots. Closely watched competitor Figure AI, for instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/\">had raised nearly $2 billion total</a> since its 2022 founding before announcing a further $1 billion round last fall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of the excitement over Apptronik is that it has <a href=\"https://apptronik.com/news-collection/apptronik-partners-with-google-deepmind-robotics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnered with Google DeepMind</a>, as well as GXO and Mercedes-Benz, to deliver what the industry calls embodied AI — robots capable of perceiving their environment and taking physical action based on reasoning, rather than just following fixed instructions. The robot is being built for tasks like unloading trailers, picking warehouse inventory, and tending machinery, the company says.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite retaining the early-stage funding label, Apptronik is no Johnny-come-lately to this field. As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/apptronik-raises-350m-to-build-humanoid-robots-with-help-from-google/\">we’ve previously reported</a>, its humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years before the company was formally founded.

A new company called <a href=\"https://www.meridian.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Meridian</a> has emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken several hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and The General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Liquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Excel agents have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT0lDFDprIg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a popular target for AI startups</a>, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agents <a href=\"https://shortcut.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">like Shortcut AI</a> built agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Ling describes it, Meridian’s biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you go to 10 different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you’ll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that’s totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result, the Meridian team has done significant work to make their outputs more auditable and deterministic, while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-based tools. The result is a mixture of agentic AI and more conventional tooling, minimizing the hallucinations that slow down many enterprise deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to really remove the doubt layer right from the LLM process,” Ling says. “You know exactly how the logic flows, and all of these assumptions or whatever that go into the model, you can see exactly where they’re coming from.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company and, specifically, how it relates to the moon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to The New York Times, which reports that it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/elon-musk-lunar-factory.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">heard the meeting</a>, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What Musk didn’t appear to address was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/elon-musk-spacex-acquires-xai-data-centers-space-merger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">xAI-SpaceX </a>entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That brings the total to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/nearly-half-of-xais-founding-team-has-now-left-the-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company</a>. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/spacexs-ipo-could-open-the-floodgates-and-secondaries-are-booming-in-the-meantime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SpaceX IPO</a> reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020640004628742577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posting</a> that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something quite powerful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/who-gets-to-inherit-the-stars-a-space-ethicist-on-what-were-not-talking-about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last month</a>, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon <em>is</em> the moon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
