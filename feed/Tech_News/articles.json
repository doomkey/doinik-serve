The video allows Neo robots to learn new tasks they weren’t previously trained on, according to 1X.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This release comes as 1X is gearing up to release its Neo humanoids into the home. The company opened up <a href=\"https://www.1x.tech/neo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">preorders for its humanoids</a> in October with plans to ship the bots this year. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After years of developing our world model and making Neo’s design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. “With the ability to transform any prompt into new actions — even without prior examples — this marks the starting point of Neo’s ability to teach itself to master nearly anything you could think to ask.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saying that the bot can transform <em>any prompt</em> into a new action is a lofty claim and not entirely accurate; you can’t tell a Neo to drive a car and it will suddenly know how to parallel park, for instance. But there is some learning going on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">1X isn’t saying the world model allows today’s Neo bots to do a new task right away from capturing video and being prompted, a company spokesperson clarified. Instead, the bot takes video data linked to specific prompts and then sends that back into the world model. That model is then fed back into the network of bots to give them a better understanding of the physical world and more know-how. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also gives users insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt. That kind of behavioral information could help 1X train these models to a point where robots will be able to react to a prompt of something they’ve never done before.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These companies have also hired armies of delivery personnel as competition heats up in the country’s booming e-commerce space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pressure on workers has intensified as the sector has grown. On New Year’s Eve, more than 200,000 gig workers staged protests across major Indian cities during the peak delivery period, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3339617/gig-workers-strike-india-spurs-debate-human-cost-delivery-race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the South China Morning Post</a>, citing the Indian Federation of App Based Transport Workers. The workers demanded legislative protection, social security benefits, better wages, and changes to automated penalty systems that reduce their ratings for late deliveries. Safety concerns have emerged around workers rushing through traffic to meet delivery deadlines. “Ultra-fast delivery models of 10-15 minutes materially change the risk and stress profile of gig work,” Prabir Jha, founder and CEO of the HR consultancy Prabir Jha People Advisory, told the outlet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid the worker protests and pressure from the labor ministry, Blinkit has removed messaging that promised deliveries within 10 minutes, and its rivals are also expected to follow suit, Bloomberg said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes little more than a month after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/indias-gig-workers-win-legal-status-but-access-to-social-security-remains-elusive/\">India granted legal status</a> to millions of gig and platform workers under new labor laws that define gig and platform workers in statute, and require aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1% to 2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s gig economy employed about 7.7 million workers in 2020-21 and is projected to reach 23.5 million by 2029-30, according to government think tank NITI Aayog.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swiggy, Blinkit, and Zepto did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, <a href=\"https://deepgram.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Deepgram</a> said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s raise continues the trend of sizable funding rounds in voice AI last year, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/sesame-the-conversational-ai-startup-from-oculus-founders-raises-250m-and-launches-beta/\">Sesame’s $250 million Series B</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elevenlabs-raises-180-million-in-series-c-funding-at-3-3-billion-valuation/\">ElevenLab’s $180 million Series C</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/paris-based-ai-voice-startup-gradium-nabs-70m-seed/\">Gradium’s $70 million seed round</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In 2024, when we were talking to enterprises about how they were thinking about using AI inside their business, we started to hear about them using voice AI in processes like contact centers and sales developments. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that’s what led us to them [Deepgram],” de Saint-Aignan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She noted that voice AI could help in making customers’ interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deepgram has a bunch of models related to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/deepgrams-aura-gives-ai-agents-a-voice/\">text-to-speech</a> and speech-to-text, along with platforms and APIs for conversational speech recognition and interruption handling with low latency. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s CEO, Scott Stephenson, said that the company didn’t need the fundraise and it was cashflow positive last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. We see that we can make larger investment sooner in order to accelerate growth. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We weren’t out looking for a raise, though. We had multiple people coming to us. We wanted strategic investors who understand voice AI and the technical intricacies of it and have relationships with companies building using the technology.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company wants to use the new fundraising to expand its global footprint and better support multiple languages. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y Combinator-backed OfOne, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick-service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">withdrew its voice AI experiment</a> after a person ordered 18,000 water cups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. There have been a lot of sour interactions with voice AI over the last 20 years, where a lot of assistants have come out, and people felt that those didn’t provide a magical experience. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne’s acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl’s Jr., picked up <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260108472215/en/Presto-Adds-%2410M-to-Accelerate-AI-Leadership-for-Enterprise-QSR-Brands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$10 million in new funding</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://market.us/report/voice-ai-agents-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Analysts’ </a><a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-voice-generators-market-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> peg the voice market to grow at over 30% year-over-year and become a $14-$20 billion market by 2030. With this growth rate, model and API providers will look to be multibillion-dollar companies by becoming a core component for enterprises and startups developing voice solutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And Salesforce CTO Parker Harris hopes it will be as viral as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cloud software giant rolled out the new version of Slackbot on Tuesday. This new AI agent version of Slackbot, which is generally available for Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, can find information, draft emails, and schedule meetings, among other things, all within the Slack platform, according to the company. It can also connect to, and interact with, other enterprise products like Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to find information if it’s granted permission. This allows users to work across a handful of different common enterprise applications without leaving Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce, and its enterprise software competitors, are pouring resources into the development of AI products in a bid to preserve, and even grow, their market share. The remodeled Slackbot, which was originally announced at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/salesforce-announces-agentforce-360-as-enterprise-ai-competition-heats-up/\">Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference</a> in October, is just one piece of Salesforce’s enterprise AI-heavy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/salesforce-announces-agentforce-360-as-enterprise-ai-competition-heats-up/\">product plan</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harris told TechCrunch the next-gen Slackbot is completely different than what existed before; the company kept the name because it is already well known.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harris added that Slack doesn’t generally release new features. Instead, Slack typically issues updates to the product to help drive adoption, which makes Slackbot quite different from past product updates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is an agent, it is a super agent that is your employee agent,” Harris said. “It’s powered by generative AI, and it is something that is highly crafted and highly curated to be an agentic experience that employees and users love.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce tests new products, like Slackbot, with its employees for months before they release them — Harris joked they like to drink their own champagne first. Slackbot has been the most adopted internal tool they’ve released, he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just seeing the sheer active user count is a great sign we have hit on product-market-fit,” Harris said about internal adoption. “Adopted, not mandated, in corporations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is just the beginning of Slackbot’s second bloom as an AI agent, Harris said. In the future, they want Slackbot to move beyond just a text-based agent only in Slack. He said they want to add voice capabilities in the future and the ability for Slackbot to browse the internet alongside its users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I am very confident that investing in Slackbot is not only good for Slack, it will be incredibly good for the entire company,” Harris said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company’s software uses computer vision to track bird movement and migration patterns, minimizing damage from wind turbines on local bird populations. This benefits both biodiversity and wind farm developers, which face strict regulations around their impact on birds — regulations that can delay construction or even shut down projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Webb and co-founder and managing director Tom Quigley described their introduction as “kismet” to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/13/superorganism-wants-to-be-the-conservationist-on-the-cap-table/\">TechCrunch back in 2023</a>. Webb had begun making angel investments focused on biodiversity to see if it could be viable as a venture capital fund strategy. While he was doing this, he reached out to Quigley because he was impressed with his background. The two started talking and eventually began working on the firm in 2022.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The political climate around protecting nature and the climate in general has changed a lot — in the U.S. at least — since the pair started working on this a few years ago. But it didn’t really hold the firm back from reaching its $25 million target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quigley said some potential LPs needed guidance in understanding what makes Superorganism different than a climate fund, but that becomes clearer when you look at the firm’s portfolio, he said. Their portfolio companies span different categories and attract different types of follow-on investors and customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are purposely building a diverse portfolio,” Quigley said. “It allows us to show what the best biodiversity companies look like across all industries, across all tech types. We think that there’s a showcase portfolio for a fund — one that’s a really powerful thing, and it’s a really stable portfolio that’s not too [affected] by different headwinds in different industries or different government policies of the day.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of these biodiversity issues transcend partisan battles over climate change too, he said. Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis recently gave a shout out to <a href=\"https://www.inversaleathers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Inversa</a>, one of Superorganism’s portfolio companies that <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/governor-ron-desantis-highlights-success-everglades-python-removal-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turns invasive species into leather goods</a>, for helping tackle a python problem in the Everglades, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thus far, the firm has invested in 20 companies and plans for a portfolio size of about 35 companies for this fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We recognize that we’re the first and we need to be there to sort of bring others along where they might be interested in taking their first bet on biodiversity, helping them find and support the right ones that can move the needle,” Quigley said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

More <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/the-next-normal/biotech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">than 200 startups</a> are now competing to weave AI directly into research workflows, attracting growing interest from investors. <a href=\"https://converge-bio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Converge Bio</a> is the latest company to ride that shift, securing new capital as competition in the AI-driven drug discovery space heats up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Boston- and Tel Aviv-based startup, which helps pharma and biotech companies develop drugs faster using generative AI trained on molecular data, has raised a $25 million oversubscribed Series A round, led by Bessemer Venture Partners. TLV Partners, Saras Capital, and Vintage Investment Partners also joined the round, along with additional backing from unidentified executives at Meta, OpenAI, and Wiz.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In practice, Converge trains generative models on DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, then plugs them into pharma and biotech’s workflows to speed up drug development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The drug-development lifecycle has defined stages — from target identification and discovery to manufacturing, clinical trials, and beyond — and within each, there are experiments we can support,” Converge Bio CEO and co-founder Dov Gertz said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. “Our platform continues to expand across these stages, helping bring new drugs to market faster.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Converge has rolled out customer-facing systems. The startup has already introduced three discrete AI systems: one for antibody design, one for protein yield optimization, and one for biomarker and target discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Take our antibody design system as an example. It’s not just a single model. It’s made up of three integrated components. First, a generative model creates novel antibodies. Next, predictive models filter those antibodies based on their molecular properties. Finally, a docking system, which uses a physics-based model, simulates the three-dimensional interactions between the antibody and its target,” Gertz continued. The value lies in the system as a whole, not any single model, according to the CEO. “Our customers don’t have to piece models together themselves. They get ready-to-use systems that plug directly into their workflows.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding comes about a year and a half after the company raised a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/converge-bios-everything-store-for-biotech-llms-brings-in-5-5m-seed/\">$5.5 million seed</a> round in 2024.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the two-year-old startup has scaled quickly. Converge has completed over 40 programs with more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotech customers, Gertz said. It works with customers across the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Israel and is now expanding into Asia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team has also grown rapidly, increasing to 34 employees from just nine in November 2024. Along the way, Converge has begun publishing public case studies. In one, the startup helped a partner boost protein yield by 4 to 4.5X in a single computational iteration. In another, the platform generated antibodies with extremely high binding affinity, reaching the single-nanomolar range, Gertz noted.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081729\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg 3707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Converge-Bio-9976.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Converge Bio</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-driven drug discovery is experiencing a surge of interest. <a href=\"https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-partners-nvidia-build-industrys-most-powerful-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Last year</a>, Eli Lilly teamed up with Nvidia to build what the companies called the pharma industry’s most powerful supercomputer for drug discovery. And in October 2024, the developers behind <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/blog/demis-hassabis-john-jumper-awarded-nobel-prize-in-chemistry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold project won a Nobel Prize</a> in Chemistry for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that can predict protein structures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked about the momentum and how it is shaping Converge Bio’s growth, Gertz said that the company is witnessing the largest financial opportunity in the history of life sciences and the industry is shifting from “trial-and-error” approaches to data-driven molecular design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We feel the momentum deeply, especially in our inboxes. A year and a half ago, when we founded the company, there was a lot of skepticism,” Gertz told TechCrunch. That skepticism has vanished remarkably quickly, thanks to successful case studies from companies like Converge and from academia, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Large language models are gaining attention in drug discovery for their ability to analyze biological sequences and suggest new molecules, but challenges like hallucinations and accuracy remain. “In text, hallucinations are usually easy to spot,” the CEO said. “In molecules, validating a novel compound can take weeks, so the cost is much higher.” To tackle this, Converge pairs generative models with predictive ones, filtering new molecules to reduce risk and improve outcomes for its partners. “This filtration isn’t perfect, but it significantly reduces risk and delivers better outcomes for our customers,” Gertz added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch also asked about experts like Yann LeCun, who remain <a href=\"https://x.com/ylecun/status/1911604721267114206\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">skeptical about using LLMs</a>. “I’m a huge fan of Yann LeCun, and I completely agree with him. We don’t rely on text-based models for core scientific understanding. To truly understand biology, models need to be trained on DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules,” Gertz explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Text-based LLMs are used only as support tools, for example, to help customers navigate literature on generated molecules. “They’re not our core technology,” Gertz said. “We’re not tied to a single architecture. We use LLMs, diffusion models, traditional machine learning, and statistical methods when it makes sense.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our vision is that every life-science organization will use Converge Bio as its generative AI lab. Wet labs will always exist, but they’ll be paired with generative labs that create hypotheses and molecules computationally. We want to be that generative lab for the entire industry,” Gertz said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>The article has been updated to include information on the number of customers</em>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company originally began as Ami, a mental wellness platform focused on how people manage pressure, form habits, and change behavior over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve always been a big sports fan — basketball, football, Formula One, MMA — and what draws me to all of them is performance. In my free time, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what actually drives human performance. People are very different, but across sports, there are clear patterns in how performance shows up,” Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His curiosity eventually shaped his professional focus. Kim started exploring what drives performance at work, and one theme kept surfacing: mental resilience. That idea led him to found a startup in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early work with Meta, which backed this startup in the seed round, helped sharpen some hard-earned lessons: Software only works when it fits into daily behavior like how people already live and work, and tools designed to help people “improve” often fail if they are judgmental, abstract, or disconnected from real work, Kim told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those ideas followed the startup through its pivot, and today they shape Hupo’s approach to sales coaching; less about replacing human judgment and more about helping people in the moments that really matter in banking, insurance, and financial services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kim said the shift wasn’t as dramatic as it might seem. “The core problem in both cases is performance at scale. In banking and insurance, results vary, not because of motivation, but because training, feedback, and confidence differ. Traditional coaching can’t reach everyone, and managers can’t sit in on every conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI that understands conversations in real time now allows teams to receive consistent coaching, even in the highly regulated, complex industry, Kim noted.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png 4770w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=768,375 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=680,332 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=1200,586 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=1280,625 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=430,210 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=720,351 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=900,439 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=800,390 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=1536,750 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=2048,1000 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=668,326 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=1264,617 1264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=708,346 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Roleplay_ebcdde.png?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Hupo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hupo has raised a $10 million Series A led by DST Global Partners, with participation from Collaborative Fund, Goodwater Capital, January Capital, and Strong Ventures. In addition, the Singapore-headquartered startup now serves dozens of customers in APAC and Europe, including Prudential, AXA, Manulife, HSBC, Bank of Ireland, and Grab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“BFSI [Banking, Financial Services and Insurance] is a notoriously difficult vertical for early-stage companies, but our customers typically expand contracts 3x to 8x within the first six months,” the founder said. “We’ll be expanding into the U.S. in the first half of this year, where distribution-heavy financial models create a strong need for scalable coaching.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kim started his career at Bloomberg, selling enterprise software to banks, asset managers, and insurers, where he saw how complex regulated sales could be. He later worked on product development at South Korean fintech Viva Republica, the company behind Toss, learning how technology built around real user behavior could reshape traditional financial services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Hupo sits at the intersection of those experiences. I understood the buyer, the end user, and the operational reality of selling financial products,” Kim said. “Once AI became capable of understanding context and coaching in real time, it became obvious to me that sales coaching — especially in banking and insurance — was the right place to apply it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many AI sales coaching tools start with the technology first, Kim said, but Hupo took a different approach, building its platform around how banks and insurers operate. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that, especially with large enterprises, you have to understand their business and industry in detail,” he added, noting that Hupo’s models were trained from the start on real financial products, common objections, client types, and regulatory requirements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest round brings total funding to $15 million since the company was founded in 2022. The new capital will go toward expanding its product, including real-time coaching features; scaling enterprise-grade deployments; growing go-to-market efforts in banking, financial services, and insurance; and building out the team.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In five years, Kim says he wants Hupo to go beyond sales coaching and help large teams perform at scale, giving managers and employees clearer insights and practical guidance, even across tens of thousands of people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

(Bee’s companion app currently reminds you to enable voice notes, so we did.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like many other AI products and services, such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/04/plaud-launches-a-new-ai-pin-and-a-desktop-meeting-notetaker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Plaud</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Granola</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fathom.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fathom</a>, <a href=\"https://fireflies.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fireflies</a>, <a href=\"http://otter.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Otter</a>, and more, Bee can listen, record, and transcribe audio conversations. Where it differs is that instead of offering an overview or a raw transcript, it segments the audio into sections and summarizes each part. For instance, an interview might be segmented into sections like the introduction, the nitty-gritty product details, an overview of industry trends, and whatever else you may have talked about.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each section is tinted with a different background color for easier differentiation as you scroll.

In addition, Bee discards the audio after transcription, making it a non-starter for use cases where you need to play back the audio to ensure accuracy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, Bee isn’t necessarily meant to be a work tool. Amazon sees this as an AI that can live alongside you as you go about your day. By integrating with Google’s services, Bee can tie a recorded conversation to a task. For instance, after meeting someone at a conference, it could suggest that you friend them on LinkedIn or research their product.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?w=313\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082060\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=552,1200 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=589,1280 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=198,430 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=331,720 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=414,900 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=368,800 368w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=943,2048 943w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=307,668 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=173,375 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=284,617 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=244,531 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7F964ECF5294-1.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bee screenshot with redacted personal data</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also leave yourself voice notes, as an alternative to writing something down in your notes app, for instance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another section in Bee’s app lets you look back at past days’ memories, while a “Grow” section will offer insights the more it learns about you.

Instead, you’re meant to ask if you can record someone’s conversation (unless at a public event of some sort, where recording is already expected).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you do record, a green light turns on, alerting others to the fact that the device is in use.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee’s sports band was a little flimsy. The band fell off twice while being worn, both times while just sitting and not moving the hands much (like in a taxi). We have not yet tested the clip-on pin, but it feels more sturdy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, the mobile app’s design is far ahead of the apps Amazon has built in-house, like the Alexa mobile experience, and it’s easy to use. But the premise that we need an AI specifically to record conversations to learn more about us is still largely untested. Is there a world where such devices make sense for consumers who aren’t recording in professional settings, like meetings and interviews?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, if AI listening devices go mainstream, there will also have to be some sort of cultural shift in terms of what’s appropriate and what’s not. Today, it’s somewhat looked down upon to record video of everyday people going about their lives, even though it’s technically legal when they’re in public; similarly, it may be considered tasteless or gauche to record audio with an AI device if you don’t first ask permission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not everyone will abide by that social contract, of course, which could see people self-censoring their speech in public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES, for instance, we were chatting with a rep at the Soundcore booth. When they liked something I said about a competitor’s product, they joked, ‘Say that louder into my microphone,’ pointing to the already-recording AI device subtly pinned to their shirt. It was an odd experience to realize that everything said in the real world could one day be “on the record,” whether you consented or not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bee’s traction — or lack thereof — will help Amazon determine if that’s a world that consumers actually want.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Sure, why not! AI was everywhere at this year’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/ces-2026-everything-revealed-from-nvidias-debuts-to-amds-new-chips-to-razers-ai-oddities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES) in Las Vegas, where companies large and small were showing off how they’re bringing AI to more devices. For Amazon, CES was a time to show off its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/amazon-acquires-bee-the-ai-wearable-that-records-everything-you-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">newest acquisition in the space: Bee</a>, an AI device that can be worn as a clip-on pin or a bracelet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon already has an entry in the AI consumer devices space with Alexa, whose upgraded AI-powered version, Alexa+, can run on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/amazon-says-97-of-its-devices-can-support-alexa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">97% of the hardware devices Amazon has shipped</a>. However, with <a href=\"https://www.bee.computer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bee</a>, the company is gaining access to a wearable that could extend its reach outside the home.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Largely designed for recording conversations like interviews, meetings, or classes, Bee also works as an AI companion. The AI has access to world knowledge, and it learns more about you from a combination of your recordings and the services you permit it to access like Gmail, Google Calendar, your phone’s contacts, and Apple Health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that Amazon has already tried integrating Alexa into wearables like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/amazons-alexa-earbuds-return-with-a-smaller-design-and-wireless-charging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earbuds</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/23/amazons-new-echo-frames-cant-touch-the-ray-ban-meta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">glasses</a>, it could seem like the company is muddying the waters with the addition of another AI companion. However, those earlier Alexa devices have not taken off in the face of competition like Apple’s AirPods and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Amazon seems to understand this, which is why it’s adding Bee to its lineup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We see each other as complementary friends,” says Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo of Bee’s relationship with Alexa, in an interview at CES last week. “Bee has the understanding of outside the house, and Alexa has the understanding of inside the house. Of course, there will be a future where these two things come together.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That future doesn’t yet mean Bee’s AI will be replaced by Alexa. Noted Amazon Alexa VP Daniel Rausch, Amazon thinks what the team at Bee created is an “important and lovable experience.” He describes Bee as a “deeply engaging and personal” AI, but he also agreed that, at some point, Alexa and Bee would come together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know that it will create even more benefit for customers than what [the AI experiences] do on their own,” Rausch explained. “When you have access to the power of these AI experiences with you throughout the day, and they’re continuous — we’re gonna be able to do so much more for customers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">De Lourdes Zollo said that Bee learns from its users, gaining an understanding of their patterns, insights, and commitments, which can help it to suggest to-do items and follow-ups throughout your day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early use cases have included students who record lectures, elderly people who have trouble remembering things, and people who speak for a living and don’t want to always take notes manually. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They just want a place to have all the summarization of everything they said,” Bee’s co-founder said. “So based on that, we build a really big graph of knowledge [about] you, where you can go chat with Bee, and have an understanding of what happened to you, but also how you’re changing during the course of your life,” de Lourdes Zollo added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to Alexa, Bee uses a combination of AI models under the hood, but it’s exploring adding Amazon’s AI as one in the mix. After transcribing the conversation, Bee discards the audio, making it impractical for many work-related use cases where you need to play back the conversation to ensure accuracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s still much ahead for Bee in 2026, de Lourdes Zollo teased, without giving anything away. In addition to recent announcements of <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/bee-amazon-wearable-ai-device-new-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new features and functionality</a> — like voice notes, templates, daily insights, and more — the founder said the eight-person team is working on “many new things” out of their HQ in San Francisco, where Amazon already has a large number of hardware and Alexa employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Honestly, it’s endless possibilities now, and that’s one of the reasons why we’re really excited to be part of Amazon,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DTa3-B1EbTp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the launch of Meta Compute, a new initiative designed to bolster the tech giant’s AI infrastructure.

How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,” Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For reference, a gigawatt is a measurement of electrical power equivalent to a billion watts.

But Anthropic’s product promises more sophistication than ChatGPT Health, which seems as though it will be more focused on a patient-side chat experience as it rolls out gradually.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though some industry professionals are concerned about the role of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/psa-you-shouldnt-upload-your-medical-images-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hallucination-prone LLMs</a> in offering clients medical advice, Anthropic’s “<a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">agent skills</a>” seem promising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Claude has added what it calls “connectors” to give the AI access to platforms and databases that can speed up research processes and report generation for payers and providers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database; the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); the National Provider Identifier Standard; and PubMed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic explained in a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/healthcare-life-sciences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> that Claude for Health could use its connectors to speed up prior authorization review, the process in which a doctor must submit additional information to an insurance provider to see if it will cover a medication or treatment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Clinicians often report spending more time on documentation and paperwork than actually seeing patients,” Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said in a presentation about the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For doctors, submitting prior authorization documents is more of an administrative task than something that requires their specialized training and expertise. It’s something that makes more sense to automate than the actual process of administering medical advice … though Claude will do that as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People are already relying on LLMs for medical advice. OpenAI said that 230 million people talk about their health with ChatGPT each week, and there’s no doubt that Anthropic is observing that use case as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, both Anthropic and OpenAI warn consumers that they should see healthcare professionals for more reliable, tailored guidance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But this is not a new idea,” Migicovsky said, referring to the smartwatch reboot. “This is an old idea. We’re just bringing it back.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pebble founder said he’s learned a lot from his earlier efforts at building a hardware device maker, including what not to do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble, the original company that Migicovsky started, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/fitbit-pebble/\">was sold to Fitbit in 2016</a> for around $40 million; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/google-is-acquiring-fitbit/\">Fitbit was later acquired by Google</a> for $2.1 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just before its exit, Migicovsky’s team had been scrambling. Christmas 2015 had put Pebble into a tailspin, as the company had bought too much inventory.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Hardware is different from software. You have to predict ahead of time how much you’re going to sell, because you need to build the hardware,” Migicovsky explained, reminiscing on the time when things went wrong. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble’s team then had estimated they would do $102 million in sales that year, but they did “only” $82 million. While that number is impressive for a smartwatch brand (particularly one that’s not Apple, Google, or Samsung), the company was left with unsold inventory that had to be sold at a discount.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Retail partners were also upset because discounted sales meant reduced margins. Meanwhile, Pebble didn’t have enough money to finish developing its new products. To make ends meet, the company had to do rapid layoffs and reorganize. And ultimately, it had to find an exit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think I lost sight of the vision of why I was building Pebble,” Migicovsky admitted. “At the beginning, it was very clear. We had a Kickstarter. We posted on the web: here’s exactly what Pebble does, here’s what the features are, here’s who should be interested in it. And then we kind of meandered a bit. We tried to do health tracking. We tried to do stuff that didn’t feel like us,” he said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079413\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg 5491w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pr2-rose-gold-onwrist2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This time around, Migicovsky aims to take a different path. The new Pebble smartwatches aren’t meant to be for everyone, he says. They’re meant to be for people like himself: a self-described “bit of a nerd,” who just likes hacking, building, and creating things. Nor are they for fitness junkies or those who want a smartphone on their wrist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I want a companion to my phone, rather than a replacement for my phone. I want it to be more like a Swatch than a Rolex. I want it to be a little bit more fun, casual, playful, and plasticky.” Plus, he added, with the reboot of Pebble, he’s now okay with a watch that doesn’t try to do it all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m okay with a limited vision and a limited scope of what we’re trying to accomplish,” Migicovsky said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the new company, Core Devices, the team has announced the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pebbles-smartwatch-is-back-pebble-time-2-specs-revealed/\">Pebble Time 2 smartwatch</a>, a round-faced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/pebble-reboots-its-thinnest-smartwatch-with-the-pebble-round-2/\">Pebble Round 2</a>, and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/\">$75 AI smart ring called the Index 01</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the company today is not going to be a large team of 180 employees as before, or one that works with distributors. Instead, there are only five people, and it sells directly to consumers on its website.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081857\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg 2386w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=1280,719 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=720,404 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=900,505 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=800,449 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1150 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=1099,617 1099w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pebbleos-core.readthedocs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">PebbleOS documentation website <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The foundation, however, remains PebbleOS, the smartwatch’s operating system, which was thankfully open sourced by Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky recalls that he ran into a Google employee at a kid’s birthday party, where he got the contact information for someone who might be able to make a call about open sourcing the smartwatch’s operating system. He sent an email to that employee, Matthieu Jeanson, requesting that Google make the OS open source, and a year later, it followed through.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really am thankful to Google, because what other big company in the world would do that?” said Migicovsky. “I think they did it as an homage to the Pebble community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Without PebbleOS, the rebooted Pebble smartwatch would have been an impossibility, as it took a team of 30 to 40 people working for years to build it originally. Recreating that from scratch wasn’t an option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, the new company’s structure is working. The company has sold 25,000 preorders for its smartwatches and around 5,000 for its AI ring, which is newer.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081850\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=1200,629 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=1280,671 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=720,378 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=900,472 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=800,420 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=668,350 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=1177,617 1177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=708,371 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble preorders are currently shipping about six months out, but Migicovsky said that the team will tighten that down to a couple of weeks. In addition, the Pebble App Store features 15,000 watch faces and apps. In a few weeks, the team will also be relaunching the SDK for developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky says the team is in a “comfortable spot,” where their expenses are paid, and they’re able to finance new projects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s right — the team is not done yet. Migicovsky won’t detail what sort of hardware devices Core Devices may ship next, but says they’ll be the sort of things he personally wants to have.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are a lot of products that are already on the market. Nothing that we’re making is like something that already exists,” Migicovsky hints. “[The next products will be] fun, casual, simple hardware, and they’re things that will kind of make my life a little bit better, one block at a time. And they’re going to work together.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Built into the Claude Desktop app, the new tool lets users designate a specific folder where Claude can read or modify files, with further instructions given through the standard chat interface. The result is similar to a sandboxed instance of Claude Code, but requires far less technical savvy to set up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview\">Currently in research preview</a>, Cowork is only available to Max subscribers, with a waitlist available for users on other plans.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new tool is inspired in part by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://everything.intellectronica.net/p/claude-code-for-non-coders\">the growing number of subscribers</a> using Claude Code to achieve non-coding tasks, treating it as a general-purpose agentic AI tool. Cowork is built on the Claude Agent SDK, which means it’s drawing on the same underlying model as Claude Code. The folder partition gives an easy way to manage what files Cowork has access to, and because the app doesn’t require command-line tools or virtual environments, it’s less intimidating for non-technical users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That opens up a new world of potential use cases. Anthropic gives the example of assembling an expense report from a folder of receipt photos — but Claude Code users have also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/everyone-should-be-using-claude-code\">put the system to work</a> managing media files, scanning social media posts, or analyzing conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to Claude Code, Cowork is designed to take strings of actions without user input — a potentially dangerous approach if the tool is given vague or contradictory instructions. In a blog post announcing the new tool, Anthropic explicitly warns about the risk of prompt injection or deleted files, recommending that users make instructions as clear and unambiguous as possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These risks aren’t new with Cowork,” the post reads, “but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched as a command-line tool in November 2024, Claude Code has become one of Anthropic’s most successful products, leading the company to launch a string of new interfaces in recent months. A web interface launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/anthropic-brings-claude-code-to-the-web/\">in October</a>, followed by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/claude-code-is-coming-to-slack-and-thats-a-bigger-deal-than-it-sounds/\">a Slack integration</a> just two months later.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If you think too long about it, it’s a bit crass, but the upshot was to provide some cost-benefit analysis of pollution controls. Lowering pollution can prolong human life, so if the health benefits of reducing pollution outweighed the costs, then there was an economic argument to be made in favor of those reductions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every administration since has assigned some value to human life when determining how to regulate air pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration is planning to throw decades of accepted practice out the window, according to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/climate/trump-epa-air-pollution.html\">report</a> in the New York Times. If the EPA follows through on its plans, then it would no longer count the value of human health when regulating ozone and fine particulate matter pollution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The risks of air pollution have been known for decades, which was part of the reason the EPA was founded under President Richard Nixon in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ozone and fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, have long been linked to cardiovascular ailments like <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/advance/health-effects-ozone-and-particulate-matter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asthma, heart disease, and emphysema</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ozone high in the atmosphere protects us against UV radiation. But when it forms close to the ground, as happens when oxides of nitrogen are emitted by everything from cars to power plants, it can create smog. On particularly smoggy days, it can be deadly to vulnerable populations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PM2.5 might be even more pernicious. Recent research has connected PM2.5 to a broader range of illnesses, including <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Parkinson’s</a>, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">kidney disease</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alzheimer’s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02844-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dementia</a>, and <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">type 2 diabetes</a>. Even the tiniest, youngest infants aren’t spared, since a mother’s exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">low birth weight</a>. Worldwide, as many as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">10 million people</a> per year die from fine particulate matter pollution annually. MAHA indeed.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy change comes at a time when data centers have been increasingly reliant on dirtier sources of electricity. Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, used <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/xai-is-facing-a-lawsuit-for-operating-over-400-mw-of-gas-turbines-without-permits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dozens of unpermitted natural gas turbines</a> to power its Colossus data center near Memphis, Tennessee, a region the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America said was already an “asthma capital” due to pollution from transportation and industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is welcoming the Trump administration’s policy change. “We appreciate the efforts of this administration to rebalance regulations with a common-sense approach. We look forward to examining the proposal from E.P.A,” Marty Durbin, president of the chamber’s Global Energy Institute, told the New York Times.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
