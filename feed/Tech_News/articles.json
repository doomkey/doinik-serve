Still, he was shocked that he received a notification on his own phone. He called his father, turned off and put his phone away, and went to buy a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was panicking,” he told TechCrunch. “It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gibson is just one of an ever-increasing number of people who are receiving notifications from companies like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://landing.google.com/intl/en_in/advancedprotection/\">Apple</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2017/03/reassuring-our-users-about-government.html\">Google</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/641700318302674\">WhatsApp</a>, all of which send similar warnings about spyware attacks to their users. Tech companies are increasingly proactive in alerting their users when they become targets of government hackers, and in particular those who use spyware made by companies such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/intellexa/\">Intellexa</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/\">NSO Group</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/paragon-solutions/\">Paragon Solutions</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But while Apple, Google, and WhatsApp alert, they don’t get involved in what happens next. The tech companies direct their users to people who could help, but at which point the companies step away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is what happens when you receive one of these warnings. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-warning-nbsp\">Warning </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You have received a notification that you were the target of government hackers. Now what? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First of all, take it seriously. These companies have reams of telemetry data about their users and what happens on both their devices and their online accounts. These tech giants have security teams that have been hunting, studying, and analyzing this type of malicious activity for years. If they think you have been targeted, they are probably right. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s important to note that in the case of Apple and WhatsApp notifications, receiving one doesn’t mean you were necessarily hacked. It’s possible that the hacking attempt failed, but they can still tell you that someone tried. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078805\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apple-threat-notification-spyware_c1489b.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">A photo showing the text of a threat notification sent by Apple to a suspected spyware victim (Image: Omar Marques/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the case of Google, it’s most likely that the company blocked the attack, and is telling you so you can go into your account and make sure you have multi-factor authentication on (ideally a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-security-keys/\">physical security key</a> or passkey), and also turn on its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://landing.google.com/intl/en_in/advancedprotection/\">Advanced Protection Program</a>, which also requires a security key and adds other layers of security to your Google account. In other words, Google will tell you how to better protect yourself in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Apple ecosystem, you should turn on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120\">Lockdown Mode</a>, which switches on a series of security features that makes it more difficult for hackers to target your Apple devices. Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/apple-says-it-is-not-aware-anyone-using-lockdown-mode-got-hacked/\">has long claimed that it has never seen a successful hack</a> against a user with Lockdown Mode enabled, but no system is perfect. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mohammed Al-Maskati, the director of Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/meet-the-team-that-investigates-when-journalists-and-activists-get-hacked-with-government-spyware/\">a 24/7 global team of security experts who investigate spyware cases against members of civil society</a>, shared with TechCrunch the advice that the helpline gives people who are concerned that they may be targeted with government spyware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This advice includes keeping your devices’ operating systems and apps up-to-date; switching on Apple’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120\">Lockdown Mode</a>, and Google’s Advanced Protection <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://landing.google.com/intl/en_in/advancedprotection/\">for accounts</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.google.com/android/answer/16339980?hl=en\">for Android devices</a>; be careful with suspicious links and attachments; to restart your phone regularly; and to pay attention to changes in how your device functions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tHave you received a notification from Apple, Google, or WhatsApp about being targeted with spyware? Or do you have information about spyware makers? We would love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reaching out for help</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What happens next depends on who you are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are open source and downloadable tools that anyone can use to detect suspected spyware attacks on their devices, which requires a little technical knowledge. You can use the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt\">Mobile Verification Toolkit</a>, or MVT, a tool that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/\">lets you look for forensic traces of an attack</a> on your own, perhaps as a first step before looking for assistance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you don’t want or can’t use MVT, you can go straight to someone who can help. If you are a journalist, dissident, academic, or human rights activist, there are a handful of organizations that can help. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can turn to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/help/\">Access Now and its Digital Security Helpline</a>. You can also contact Amnesty International, which has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://securitylab.amnesty.org/get-help/\">its own team of investigators</a> and ample experience in these cases. Or, you can reach out to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/\">The Citizen Lab</a>, a digital rights group at the University of Toronto, which has been investigating spyware abuses for almost 15 years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you are a journalist, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://rsf.org/en/digital-security-lab\">Reporters Without Borders</a> also has a digital security lab that offers to investigate suspected cases of hacking and surveillance. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of these categories of people, politicians or business executives, for example, will have to go elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you work for a large company or political party, you likely have a competent (hopefully!) security team you can go straight to. They may not have the specific knowledge to investigate in-depth, but in that case they probably know who to turn to, even if Access Now, Amnesty, and Citizen Lab cannot help those outside of civil society. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Otherwise, there aren’t many places executives or politicians you can turn to, but we have asked around and found the ones below. We can’t fully vouch for any of these organizations, nor do we endorse them directly, but based on suggestions from people we trust, it’s worth pointing them out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps the most well known of these private security companies is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://iverify.io/\">iVerify</a>, which makes an app for Android and iOS, and also gives users an option to ask for an in-depth forensic investigation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Matt Mitchell, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/matt-mitchell-is-arming-underserved-communities-with-anti-surveillance-tools/\">a well-regarded security expert</a> who’s been helping vulnerable populations protect themselves from surveillance has a new startup, called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://safetysyncgroup.com/\">Safety Sync Group</a>, which offers this kind of service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jessica Hyde, a forensic investigator with experience in the public and private sectors, has her own startup called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hexordia.com/contact\">Hexordia</a>, and offers to investigate suspected hacks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mobile cybersecurity company Lookout, which has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/spyware-maker-caught-distributing-malicious-android-apps-for-years/\">experience</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/north-korean-government-hackers-snuck-spyware-on-android-app-store/\">analyzing</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/17/hermit-spyware-government/\">government</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/researchers-uncover-chinese-spyware-used-to-target-android-devices/\">spyware</a> from around the world, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lookout.com/form/report-mobile-incident\">has an online form</a> that allows people to reach out for help to investigate cyberattacks involving malware, device compromise, and more. The company’s threat intelligence and forensics teams may then get involved.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, there’s Costin Raiu, who heads <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tlpblack.net/\">TLPBLACK</a>, a small team of security researchers who used to work at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Group, or GReAT. Raiu was the unit’s head when his team discovered sophisticated cyberattacks from elite government hacking teams from the United States, Russia, Iran, and other countries. Raiu told TechCrunch that people who suspect they’ve been hacked can <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:costin@tlpblack.net\">email him</a> directly.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Investigation</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What happens next depends on who you go to for help. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Generally speaking, the organization you reach out to may want to do an initial forensic check by looking at a diagnostic report file that you can create on your device, which you can share with the investigators remotely. At this point, this doesn’t require you to hand over your device to anyone. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This first step may be able to detect signs of targeting or even infection. It may also turn out nothing. In both cases, the investigators may want to dig deeper, which will require you to send in a full backup of your device, or even your actual device. At that point, the investigators will do their work, which may take time because modern government spyware attempts to hide and delete its tracks, and will tell you what happened. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately, modern spyware may not leave any traces. The modus operandi these days, according to Hassan Selmi, who leads the incident response team at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/meet-the-team-that-investigates-when-journalists-and-activists-get-hacked-with-government-spyware/\">Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</a>, is a “smash and grab” strategy, meaning that once spyware infects the target device, it steals as much data as it can, and then tries to remove any trace and uninstall itself. This is assumed as the spyware makers trying to protect their product and hide its activity from investigators and researchers.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you are a journalist, a dissident, an academic, a human rights activist, the groups who help you may ask if you want to publicize the fact that you were attacked, but you’re not required to do so. They will be happy to help you without taking public credit for it. There may be good reasons to come out, though: To denounce the fact that a government targeted you, which may have the side effect of warning others like you of the dangers of spyware; or to expose a spyware company by showing that their customers are abusing their technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We hope you never get one of these notifications. But we also hope that, if you do, you find this guide useful. Stay safe out there.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Kevin Hartz’s security system failed to alert him as an intruder rang his doorbell and tried to enter his San Francisco home late one night, the serial entrepreneur decided existing solutions weren’t good enough. His co-founder Jack Abraham had experienced similar frustrations at his Miami Beach residence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, they launched <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sauron.systems/\">Sauron</a> — named after the sinister, all-seeing eye from “The Lord of the Rings” — to build what they envisioned as a military-grade home security system for tech elites. The concept resonated in Bay Area circles, where crime had become a constant topic during and after the pandemic, despite San Francisco Police Department statistics showing property crime and homicide rates declining last year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup raised $18 million from executives behind Flock Safety and Palantir, defense tech investors including 8VC, Abraham’s startup lab Atomic, and Hartz’s investment firm A*. It came out of stealth exactly a year ago, promising to launch in the first quarter of 2025 with a system combining AI-driven intelligence, advanced sensors like LiDAR and thermal imaging, and 24/7 human monitoring by former military and law enforcement personnel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a year later, Sauron is still very much in development mode —  a reality that its new CEO, Maxime “Max” Bouvat-Merlin, acknowledged candidly in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After nearly nine years at Sonos, including a stint as chief product officer, Bouvat-Merlin took the helm of Sauron just last month. He’s spending his first days on the job finalizing fundamental questions: which sensors to use, how exactly the deterrence system will work, and when the company can realistically get products into customers’ homes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The answer to that last question? Later in 2026 at the earliest — a significant delay from the original timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in the development phase,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “You’ll see a phased approach where we get our solution to market as a stepping stone. All the different components — our concierge service, our AI software running on servers, our smart cameras — are building blocks coming together in a plan we just put in place very recently.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Bouvat-Merlin sees striking parallels between Sauron and Sonos, which both target wealthy customers first, rely on word-of-mouth growth, and combine complex hardware with sophisticated software. “I had lunch with John MacFarlane, the founder of Sonos, a few weeks ago,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “All the topics he was thinking about when starting Sonos were exactly the same topics we’re discussing at Sauron.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both companies faced the same strategic questions: Start with super-premium customers or mass premium? Professional installation or DIY? Build everything in-house or partner with an ecosystem? “We might make different decisions, but the questions are very similar,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The security problem </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bouvat-Merlin says he was drawn to Sauron by both the mission and an opportunity to solve a real customer problem. “Securing people’s homes is important, but I also like the deterrence aspect — changing people’s minds before they make a bad decision and get into trouble,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His research showed that market leaders in premium home security have small market shares and negative Net Promoter Scores. “People are not happy with their solutions today,” he said. “There are so many false positives that when law enforcement is called, they don’t respond because they assume it’s a false alarm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is targeting customers “where safety and security is a major concern”  —  people like Hartz. The plan is to start with this premium segment, establish a reputation for supporting demanding clients, then expand to what Bouvat-Merlin calls “mass premium.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The product (that’s still taking shape)</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So what exactly is Sauron building? The answer is still evolving. The offering starts with camera pods containing multiple sensors —  “40 cameras and different types of sensors, potentially LiDAR and radar, potentially thermal,” Bouvat-Merlin said. These pods connect to servers running machine learning software for computer vision, all linked to a 24/7 concierge service staffed by former military and law enforcement personnel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Those people understand patterns,” he said. “They’re good at helping us mature our machine learning solution and train our system to detect weird behaviors.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deterrence system remains somewhat vague. Options being considered include loudspeakers, flashing lights, and other methods. But Bouvat-Merlin emphasized that deterrence should begin before someone enters a property, detecting when homes are being surveilled, noticing cars circling neighborhoods multiple times, and identifying threats at each stage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The more upfront we are with deterrence, the more we can convince people this is the wrong house to rob and the wrong decision to make,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the drones mentioned when Sauron first took the wraps off its plans last year, Bouvat-Merlin declined to say much. “These are roadmap conversations. I don’t want to go too deep at this point because there are so many things we could do, but we’re such a small company,” he said. He added that, bigger picture, the focus is on growing the ecosystem through partnerships rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Timeline and business model</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With fewer than 40 employees, Sauron plans to hire just 10 to 12 more in 2026. The company will also begin working with early adopters later in 2026, with a Series A fundraise planned for mid-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Raising a Series A is not about raising because we have to — it’s because we want to,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “I want to make sure we’re showing progress and explaining how we’ll use extra funds to accelerate growth, [including to] launch our first end-to-end product, drive customer adoption, and accelerate the roadmap.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has already attracted a significant list of prospective clients, he said, thanks to work by Sauron’s three founders, which include roboticist and engineer <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasumathi-raman/\">Vasumathi Raman</a>. “We expect the strategy initially to be word of mouth, then grow differently over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Bouvat-Merlin is cautious about growth. “I want to make sure we grow sustainably and keep the experience and service premium over time,” he said. “I want to manage growing pains as much as possible while driving profitability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The surveillance state question<br></strong><br>Facial recognition and privacy concerns loom large for a surveillance-heavy product. Bouvat-Merlin outlined one approach: a trust-based system where homeowners grant access to specific people. “I granted you access to my house, so now you’re in the trusted group. When you come, I detect it’s you and you’re allowed in. Everyone else is an unknown person,” he said, painting a picture of a likely scenario.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">License plate detection is also being considered for identifying cars circling neighborhoods multiple times. “How do we assess if that’s a threat? The ex-military and ex-law enforcement team will be really good at helping mature our machine learning solution,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, Bouvat-Merlin is confident in the opportunity ahead because of Sauron’s approach. “A lot of companies started as traditional security companies and are trying to add tech,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’re looking at it from the opposite angle — we’re a tech startup in San Francisco bringing technology to this market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sauron is also appearing on the scene as concerns rise about crime among the most wealthy. Recent high-profile incidents include a November armed robbery at the home of tech investors Lachy Groom and Joshua Buckley in San Francisco’s Mission District, where $11 million in cryptocurrency was stolen during a 90-minute ordeal involving torture and threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We see people who are wealthy attracting criminals,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’ve seen a lot of robberies in San Francisco and other major U.S. cities, sometimes at gunpoint. I don’t think the world is getting safer — there are probably more disparities between people at the top and bottom of the wealth spectrum. We see anxiety from prospective clients who are eager to get their homes secured.”<br><br>Still, much remains uncertain about Sauron’s path. The company must finalize everything from sensor configurations to manufacturing locations. (Bouvat-Merlin mentioned potentially starting in the U.S. for proximity and control, then moving to more affordable locations as volume grows.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It must also determine how to serve customers in different settings,  from estates with perimeters to dense urban residences, while maintaining premium service quality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Bouvat-Merlin says he’s focused on listening to his team, building credibility, and finalizing the strategy he’s putting in place. “I don’t demand that people trust me  — I want to show them why they should.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company expects to share more details about its products later next year.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If you received an Apple gift card over the holidays and are exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047856\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png 3280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1280,574 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=2048,919 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=1375,617 1375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-watch-se3-colors.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need. </p>\n\n<p

Dutch entrepreneur <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nalden.net\">Nalden</a>, who co-founded the platform in 2009, says he’s deeply unhappy with changes made since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bending-spoons-acquires-file-transfer-service-wetransfer/\">Bending Spoons</a> — a Milan-based tech firm known for buying and restructuring popular apps — acquired the service last year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bending Spoons doesn’t really care about people. Even though I get that it is their private equity strategy, I notice that since I left [WeTransfer] in 2019, there were a lot of updates that were basically killing the product, in my point of view,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the acquisition, WeTransfer made unclear changes to how transfer links work and laid off 75% of its staff. This year, the company sparked controversy over employing its users’ content to train AI models and had to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/wetransfer-backtracks-on-ai-file-training-after-backlash-what-you-need-to-know/\">backtrack on changes to its terms</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after, Nalden says creatives began reaching out to share their frustration with WeTransfer. He realized he wanted to build an alternative to WeTransfer that recaptured the original ethos of the service around simplicity. That service is called Boomerang, and users can transfer files without logging in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Why do tech companies always make things so complicated? I’ve always struggled with this, and I just wanted to offer another tool that [is entirely focused on the] user experience, its ease of use. It’s the simplicity of sharing something quickly and that just saves time.

The startup is focused on essentially one task: preventing damaging water leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers use a lot of water, and that water can present a big risk, even if a leak is small. Founder John Khazraee told TechCrunch that many data centers only have reactive solutions for water leaks. That can saddle companies with downtime and set them back millions of dollars if one occurs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee would know. He spent more than 15 years building infrastructure for IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. With MayimFlow, he’s developed a combination of IoT sensors and edge-deployed machine learning models that can detect signs of impending leaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve noticed these issues in data centers, and the only solution they had was: ‘when the leak happens, we find out,’” he said in an interview. “Now you have to spend a lot of money to go remediate the situation. Now you got to turn off the servers. Now the data is being disrupted. So I decided to do something about it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee assembled a small team with plenty of experience to take on this challenge. Jim Wong, MayimFlow’s chief strategy officer, has spent decades working with data centers. Chief technology officer Ray Lok has carved out a career in water management and IoT infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the scariest consequences of unnoticed water leaks, there’s an element of frugality to what Khazraee is trying to do with MayimFlow, which he said comes from his childhood.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I grew up in a very, you know, I don’t want to say the word ‘poor’ family, but we weren’t the most well-off family,” he said. “And my dad would always, when I was taking a shower, tell me, ‘Hey, you’re in the shower too long. Are you singing in there?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As he grew up, Khazraee said he found himself always thinking about how to make things more efficient — especially as he studied to become an engineer. In college, he worked at a facility that collected frying oil from restaurants and converted it to biodiesel. It was a “messy job,” he said, but he liked the end result. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee is now trying to mix this penchant for frugality with the experience of his team. He believes they can give data center operators 24 to 48 hours of advanced warning that repairs will be needed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">MayimFlow has collected a glut of sample data from various industrial water systems that allow them to make these kinds of predictions, he said. The company can provide sensors that can help monitor a water system or plug its machine learning models into existing ones if companies already have similar hardware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee said he wants to bring this solution beyond data centers to commercial buildings, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and possibly even utilities. In his eyes, any company that wants to spot leaks early, or optimize water usage, could be a customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khazraee thinks it’s such a big opportunity he’s turned down roles at multiple big tech companies while building MayimFlow over the last two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really believe in the vision. I believe in the impact that we’re making,” he said. “Water is becoming one of those big issues in our world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

I didn’t opt for an Apple Watch because I wasn’t constantly active, I didn’t feel the need to check my notifications, and I didn’t want to think about charging the watch every day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, I got a chance to test the new Google Pixel Watch 4, which made me feel like I might start wearing smartwatches again. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have always had a soft spot for circular watches. One of the first smartwatches I owned was the Moto 360, and I loved its rounded design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel Watch 4 has a curved domed Actua 360 display with thinner bezels as compared to last year’s watch. I have the 41 mm watch as the test unit, but I would personally opt for the 45mm size for battery and a bigger display. The display is also brighter with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and that makes it easier to use in daylight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The battery life is great on the Pixel Watch 4, even with the smaller size. I have managed to get more than a day’s use out of the watch on those days when I have lighter activities.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078508\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pixel-Watch-4-Charger.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Ivan Mehta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though the Pixel Watch 4 has a proprietary charger where you can place the watch on the cradle like a puck, the charging speed makes up for it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google advertises that you can charge this watch from 0% to 50% in 15 minutes and from 0% to 100% in 45 minutes. While the real-life timing doesn’t exactly match these numbers, I saw charging times that came close to these figures. The advantage of this rapid charging is that you can always put your watch to charge when you are making a coffee or doing a quick chore within the house, and get enough juice to last you throughout the day.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fitness-and-software\">Fitness and software</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I largely used the Google Pixel Watch 4 to track my pickleball sessions and walking. Apart from calorie burns, there were no particular insights into sports-related movement. For the last 15 days, I started going to a gym, and apart from the treadmill and elliptical mode, there aren’t any specialized modes for particular gym equipment. Instead, you have to select from options for things like core training, weights, or a general workout mode, based on the workout you are doing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The watch does have more features for someone who runs — but that’s not possible in Delhi weather with terrible AQI right now. It also detects cardio workouts after 15 minutes of continuous activities, but while walking, these have been hit or miss for me. Another measure that has been off for me has been floor count. On days, I’ve walked to a cafe, I’ve seen a very high count for that, and on days I have gone up to my terrace multiple times, the number of floors climbed is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I am not someone who used to wear my watch or band to sleep. With the Pixel Watch 4, I had to mentally train myself to keep the watch on so I could get a better understanding of sleep and readiness scores. After a few weeks of usage, I regularly wore my watch to sleep. However, you don’t get additional or actionable insights related to sleep or readiness score on the watch in the daily summary. You do get suggestions on the Fitbit app related to readiness, but that’s about it. With fitness apps adding more AI to their apps, Google needs to step up its game.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?w=311\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3078520\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=137,300 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=768,1681 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=311,680 311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=548,1200 548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=585,1280 585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=196,430 196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=329,720 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=411,900 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=702,1536 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=936,2048 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=305,668 305w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=171,375 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=282,617 282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=243,531 243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251223-200408.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Screenshot by Techcrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s new Material UI design for the watch is refreshing and matches the theme on my Pixel Fold. The weather app is very nice to look at for both hourly and day forecasts. My one gripe is that I wish the exercise app allowed for more than three kinds of workouts to be available through quick start. I could raise my watch to talk to Gemini, which is neat, but beyond starting timers, asking for occasional sports updates, and starting a workout, I have not needed Gemini to be ever-present for me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have been a fan of the recent Pixel Watch 4 update that lets me use the pinch gesture to dismiss notifications, play or pause videos or music, or even move my wrist to dismiss calls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The gripes I had about the watch didn’t bother me in daily usage. The display is fantastic, the software and fitness experience overall are great, and the display, along with the new design, is an upgrade from the last generation. However, the thing that drew me the most to the watch and made me stick to it is the combo of battery life and fast charging. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All in all, the Pixel Watch 4 is one of the best Android smartwatches around.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The number of startup funding rounds fell by nearly 39% from a year earlier, to 1,518 deals, according to Tracxn. Total funding slipped more modestly — down just over 17% to $10.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That pullback was not uniform. Seed-stage funding fell sharply to $1.1 billion in 2025, down 30% from 2024, as investors cut back on more experimental bets. Late-stage funding also cooled, slipping to $5.5 billion, a 26% decline from last year, amid tougher scrutiny of scale, profitability, and exit prospects. However, early-stage funding proved more resilient, rising to $3.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079057\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,1000 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,1067 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,358 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,600 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,750 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,667 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1536,1280 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,557 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=450,375 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=740,617 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=637,531 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The capital deployment focus has increased towards early-stage startups,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn, pointing to growing confidence in founders who can demonstrate stronger product–market fit, revenue visibility and unit economics in a tighter funding environment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-ai-quest\">The AI quest</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nowhere was that recalibration clearer than in AI, as AI startups in India raised just over $643 million across 100 deals in 2025, a modest 4.1% increase from a year earlier, per Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. The capital was mainly spread across early and early-growth stages. Early-stage AI funding totaled $273.3 million, while late-stage rounds raised $260 million, reflecting investor preference for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">application-led businesses</a> over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">capital-intensive model development</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was in sharp contrast to the U.S., where AI funding in 2025 surged past $121 billion across 765 rounds, per Tracxn, a 141% jump from 2024, and was overwhelmingly dominated by late-stage deals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t yet have an AI-first company in India, which is $40–$50 million of revenue, if not $100 million, in a year’s time frame, and that is globally happening,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, Swaroop told TechCrunch, lacks large foundational model companies and will take time to build the research depth, talent pipeline, and patient capital needed to compete at that layer — making application-led AI and adjacent deep-tech areas a more realistic focus in the near term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This pragmatism has shaped where investors are placing longer-term bets outside core AI. Venture capital is increasingly flowing into manufacturing and deep-tech sectors. These are some of the areas where India faces less global capital competition and has clear advantages in talent, cost structures, and customer access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/here-are-the-49-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">absorbs a significant share of investor attention</a>, capital in India arguably remains more evenly distributed than in the U.S., with substantial funding still flowing into consumer, manufacturing, fintech, and deep-tech startups. Swaroop noted that advanced manufacturing in particular has emerged as a long-term opportunity, with the number of such startups increasing nearly tenfold over the past four to five years — an area he described as a clear “right to win” for India given lower global capital competition.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, said AI startups accounted for roughly 30–40% of deals in India in 2025, but pointed to a parallel surge in consumer-facing companies as changing behaviour among India’s urban population creates demand for faster, more on-demand services — from quick commerce to household services — categories that play to India’s scale and density rather than Silicon Valley–style capital intensity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-versus-the-u-s\">India versus the U.S.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data from PitchBook shows a stark divergence in capital deployment between India and the U.S. in 2025. U.S. venture funding surged to $89.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone, according to PitchBook data up to December 23, compared with about $4.2 billion raised by Indian startups over the same period.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079058\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=768,581 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=680,515 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1200,908 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1280,969 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=430,325 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=720,545 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=900,681 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=800,605 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1536,1162 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=668,506 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=496,375 496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=815,617 815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=702,531 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, that gap does not tell the whole story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightspeed’s Taneja cautioned against drawing direct parallels between India and the U.S., arguing that differences in population density, labour costs, and consumer behaviour shape which business models can scale. Categories such as quick commerce and on-demand services have found far greater traction in India than in the U.S., reflecting local economics rather than any lack of ambition among founders or investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Lightspeed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lightspeed-raises-record-9b-in-fresh-capital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $9 billion in fresh capital</a> with a strong focus on AI, but Taneja said the move does not signal a wholesale shift in the firm’s India strategy. The U.S. fund, he noted, is geared toward a different market and maturity cycle, while Lightspeed’s India arm will continue backing consumer startups alongside selectively exploring AI opportunities shaped by local demand rather than global capital intensity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nuances-in-india-s-startup-ecosystem\">Nuances in India’s startup ecosystem</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s startup ecosystem also saw funding for women-led startups tighten. Capital invested in women-founded tech startups held relatively steady at about $1 billion in 2025, down 3% from a year earlier, according to Tracxn’s report. Still, that headline figure masked a sharper pullback beneath the surface. The number of funding rounds in women-founded startups fell by 40%, while their first-time funded counterparts declined by 36%.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079059\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg 1510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,89 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,227 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,201 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,354 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,378 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,127 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,213 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,266 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,236 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,197 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1440,425 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=708,209 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,15 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1510px) 100vw, 1510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">India’s women-led startups saw a 3% dip in funding in 2025</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, investor participation narrowed sharply as selectivity increased, with about 3,170 investors taking part in funding rounds in India this year, a 53% drop from roughly 6,800 a year earlier, according to Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. India-based investors accounted for nearly half of that activity, with around 1,500 domestic funds and angels participating — a sign that local capital played a more prominent role as global investors turned cautious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activity also became more concentrated among a smaller group of repeat backers. Inflection Point Ventures emerged as the most active investor, participating in 36 funding rounds, followed by Accel with 34, Tracxn data shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government’s participation in the startup ecosystem became more visible in 2025. New Delhi announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/india-pledges-fresh-billion-for-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.15 billion Fund of Funds</a> in January to expand capital access for startups, followed by a ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation scheme aimed at areas such as energy transition, quantum computing, robotics, space technology, biotech, and AI, using a mix of long-term loans, equity infusions and allocations to deep-tech funds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That push has begun to catalyze private capital as well. The government’s growing involvement helped spur a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nearly $2 billion commitment</a> from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/u-s-and-indian-vcs-just-formed-a-1b-alliance-to-fund-indias-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. and Indian venture capital and private equity firms</a>, including Accel, Blume Ventures, and Celesta Capital, to back deep-tech startups — an effort that also brought Nvidia on board as an adviser and drew Qualcomm Ventures. Furthermore, the Indian government also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/india-eyes-global-quantum-computer-push-and-qpiai-is-its-chosen-vehicle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-led a $32 million funding</a> for quantum computing startup QpiAI earlier this year — a rare federal move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This growing state involvement has helped ease a risk long flagged by investors: regulatory uncertainty. “One of the biggest risks you don’t want to underwrite is what happens if regulation changes,” said Taneja of Lightspeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As government entities become more familiar with the startup ecosystem, Taneja added, policy is more likely to evolve alongside it — reducing uncertainty for investors backing companies with longer development cycles.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-exits-in-india\">Exits in India</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reduced uncertainty has already started to show up in exit markets to some extent. India saw a steady pipeline of technology IPOs over the past two years, with 42 tech companies going public in 2025, up 17% from 36 in 2024, per Tracxn. Much of the demand for those listings has come from domestic institutional and retail investors, easing long-standing concerns that Indian startup exits depend too heavily on foreign capital. M&amp;A activity also picked up, with acquisitions rising 7% year-over-year to 136 deals, Tracxn data shows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop of Accel said investors had long worried that India’s public markets were mainly sustained by foreign capital, raising questions about exit durability during global downturns. “This year has disproven that,” he said, pointing to the growing role of domestic investors in absorbing technology listings — a shift that has made exits more predictable and reduced reliance on volatile overseas flows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079060\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,600 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,531 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,938 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,1000 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,336 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,563 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,703 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,625 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1536,1200 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,522 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=480,375 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=790,617 790w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s unicorn pipeline in 2025 also reflected that shift toward restraint. While the number of new unicorns remained flat year over year, Indian startups reached $1 billion valuations with less capital, fewer funding rounds, and a smaller pool of institutional investors, pointing to a more measured path to scale compared with both previous years and global peers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Challenges remain as India heads into 2026, particularly around how it positions itself in the global race for AI and whether late-stage funding can deepen without relying on outsized capital inflows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even so, the shifts seen in 2025 point to a startup ecosystem that is maturing rather than retreating — one where capital is being deployed more deliberately, exits are becoming more predictable, and domestic market dynamics increasingly shape its growth. For investors, India is emerging less as a substitute for developed markets and more as a complementary arena with its own risk profile, timelines, and opportunities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At TechCrunch Disrupt, three investors — Thomas Green of Insight Partners, Moxxie Ventures’ Katie Stanton, and GV’s Sangeen Zeb — broke down what they’ll be looking for in the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers tell a clear story. Fewer rounds are getting funded but deal sizes have grown, said Green citing a study.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It has never been easier to start a company, and it has never been harder to build something that is defensible,” Stanton said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Zeb, GV uses a specific formula to evaluate companies. The firm analyzes whether startups have achieved product-market fit, examining demand patterns to ensure every quarter outperforms the last. “That sequence should be happening consistently,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanton echoed this priority. “Can you prove that you can repeatedly sell? Can you prove that you can repeatedly grow in a big and growing market?”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Green cautioned that not every company should pursue venture-scale growth. “It’s not worth even taking this money unless you think it can be a really big business, right?” he said. “Most companies should not [pursue] venture scale. They should not take hundreds of millions of dollars.”  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond metrics, all three investors emphasized founder quality. Stanton said she is looking for passionate founders who can endure the long journey of building a company. Zeb agreed. “Passion is still the most important thing,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The panel inevitably turned to AI. Green assured non-AI companies: “Just because you’re not AI doesn’t mean you don’t have a very attractive asset, intrinsic quality to you,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For AI companies trying to differentiate in a crowded market, Green returns to first principles. “We try to understand, if it’s a market with a lot of competition — [including] both incumbents and next-gen competitors and platform players — what is going to be the standout path?”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanton said she looks founders who combine industry and technical expertise, while Zeb prioritizes relentless drive, seeking founders who are constantly asking how to move faster than the competition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite market fluctuations, the panel suggested that core investor priorities remain consistent. “The bar is high, but if the outcome can be impossibly huge, we’ll take that [bet],” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They work for the New York-headquartered nonprofit Access Now, specifically its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://accessnow.org/help/\">Digital Security Helpline</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their mission is to be the team of people who journalists, human rights defenders, and dissidents can go to if they suspect they’ve been hacked, such as with mercenary spyware made by companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/\">NSO Group</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/sanctioned-spyware-maker-intellexa-had-direct-access-to-government-espionage-victims-researchers-say/\">Intellexa</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/paragon/\">Paragon</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The idea is to provide this 24/7 service to civil society and journalists so they can reach out whenever they have… a cybersecurity incident,” Hassen Selmi, who leads the incident response team at the Helpline, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obk5T6kS0WY&amp;t=292s\">According to Bill Marczak</a>, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab who has been investigating spyware for almost 15 years, Access Now’s Helpline is a “frontline resource” for journalists and others who may have been targeted or hacked with spyware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The helpline has become a critical funnel for victims. So much so that when Apple sends its users a so-called “threat notification” alerting them that they have been targeted with mercenary spyware, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/why-apple-sends-spyware-victims-to-this-nonprofit-security-lab/\">the tech giant has long directed victims to Access Now’s investigators</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In speaking with TechCrunch, Selmi described a scenario where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/apple-alerts-exploit-developer-that-his-iphone-was-targeted-with-government-spyware/\">someone gets one of these threat notifications</a>, and where Access Now can help victims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Having someone who could explain it to them, tell them what they should do, what they should not do, what this means… This is a big relief for them,” said Selmi. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to several digital rights experts who have investigated spyware cases and previously spoke with TechCrunch, Apple is generally taking the right approach, even if the optics look like a trillion-dollar tech giant offloading its responsibility to a small team of nonprofit workers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being mentioned by Apple in the notifications, said Selmi, was “one of the biggest milestones” for the helpline.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi and his colleagues now look into about 1,000 cases of suspected government spyware attacks per year. Around half of those cases turn into actual investigations, and only around 5% of them, around 25, result in a confirmed case of spyware infection, according to Mohammed Al-Maskati, the helpline’s director.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Selmi started doing this work in 2014, Access Now were only investigating around 20 cases of suspected spyware attacks per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, there were three or four people working in each timezone in Costa Rica, Manila, and Tunisia, locations that allowed them to have someone online throughout the whole day. The team isn’t that much bigger now, with fewer than 15 people working for the helpline. The helpline has more people in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan region, given that these are hotspots for spyware cases, according to Selmi.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The increase in cases, Selmi explained, is due to several circumstances. For one, the helpline is now more well known, so it attracts more people. Then, with government spyware going global and becoming more available, there are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/why-a-lot-of-people-are-getting-hacked-with-government-spyware/\">potentially more cases of abuse</a>. Finally, the helpline team has done more outreach to potentially targeted populations, finding cases of abuse they may not have found otherwise. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tHave you received a notification from Apple, Google, or WhatsApp about being targeted with spyware? Or do you have information about spyware makers? We would love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When someone contacts the helpline, Selmi told TechCrunch, its investigators first acknowledge receipt, then they do a first check to see if the person who contacted them is within the organization’s mandate, meaning if they are part of civil society — and not, for example, a business executive or lawmaker. Then, the investigators assess the case in triage. If a case is prioritized, the investigators ask questions, such as why the person believes they were targeted (if there was no notification), and what device they own, which helps to establish what kind of information the investigators may need to collect from the victim’s device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After an initial, limited check of the device performed remotely over the internet, the helpline’s handlers and investigators may ask the victim to send more data, such as a full backup of their device, to do a more thorough analysis examining for signs of intrusions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For each known kind of exploit that has been used in the last five years, we have a process on how to check that exploit,” said Selmi, referring to known hacking techniques. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know more or less what is normal, what is not,” said Selmi.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Access Now handlers, who manage communication and often speak the victim’s language, will also give the victim advice on what to do, such as whether to get another device, or take other precautions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every case that the nonprofit looks into is unique. “It’s different from person to person, from culture to culture,” Selmi told TechCrunch. “I think we should do more research, get more people on board — not just technical people — to know how to deal with these kinds of victims.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi said that the helpline has also been supporting similar investigative teams in some regions of the world, sharing documentation, knowledge, and tools, as part of a coalition called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.civicert.org/\">CiviCERT</a>, a global network of organizations that can help members of civil society who suspect they were targeted with spyware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi said this network has also helped to reach journalists and others in places where otherwise they could not get to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“No matter where they are, [victims] have people who could talk to and report to,” Selmi told TechCrunch. “Having these people talk their language and know their context helped a lot.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label.html\">social media platforms should add warning labels</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,” Hochul said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the bill’s sponsors, Assemblymember Nily Rozic, made a similar point in a statement of his own: “New York families deserve honesty about how social media platforms impact mental health. By requiring warning labels based on the latest medical research, this law puts public health first and finally gives us the tools we need to make informed decisions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">California lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/a-new-california-bill-would-add-warning-labels-to-social-media-platforms-233653838.html\">proposed a similar bill.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/09/new-york-moves-to-limit-kids-access-to-addictive-feeds/\">New York passed laws</a> requiring that social media platforms obtain parental consent before showing children “addictive feeds” and before collecting or selling the personal data of users under 18.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t Hochul’s only end-of-year tech regulation; she also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-signs-raise-act-to-regulate-ai-safety/\">recently signed the AI safety-focused RAISE Act</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
