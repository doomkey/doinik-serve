            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An internal research study at Meta dubbed “Project MYST” created in partnership with the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.norc.org/\">University of Chicago</a>, found that parental supervision and controls — such as time limits and restricted access — had little impact on kids’ compulsive use of social media. The study also found that kids who experienced stressful life events were more likely to lack the ability to moderate their social media use appropriately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was one of the notable claims revealed during testimony at the social media addiction trial that began last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is identified by her initials “KGM” or her first name, “Kaley.” She, along with her mother and others joining the case, is accusing social media companies of creating “addictive and dangerous” products that led the young users to suffer anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case is now one of several landmark trials that will take place this year, which accuse social media companies of harming children. The results of these lawsuits will impact these companies’ approach to their younger users and could prompt regulators to take further action. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this case, the plaintiff sued Meta, YouTube, ByteDance (TikTok), and Snap, but the latter two companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/snap-reaches-settlement-in-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">had</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/tiktok-joins-snap-to-settle-social-media-addiction-lawsuit/\">settled</a> their claims before the trial’s start.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the jury trial now underway in L.A., Kaley’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, brought up an internal study at Meta, which he said found evidence that Meta knew of, yet didn’t publicize, these specific harms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Project MYST, which stands for the Meta and Youth Social Emotional Trends survey, Meta’s research concluded that “parental and household factors have little association with teens’ reported levels of attentiveness to their social media use.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or, in other words, even when parents try to control their children’s social media use, either by using parental controls or even just household rules and supervision, it doesn’t impact whether or not the child will overuse social media or use it compulsively. The study was based on a survey of 1,000 teens and their parents about their social media use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The study also noted that both parents and teens agreed on this front, saying “there is no association between either parental reports or teen reports of parental supervision, and teens’ survey measures of attentiveness or capability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the study’s findings are accurate, that would mean that the use of things like the built-in parental controls in the Instagram app or the time limits on smartphones wouldn’t necessarily help teens become less inclined to overuse social media, the plaintiff’s lawyer argued. As the original complaint alleges, teens are being exploited by social media products, whose defects include algorithmic feeds designed to keep users scrolling, intermittent variable rewards that manipulate dopamine delivery, incessant notifications, deficient tools for parental controls, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During his testimony, Instagram head Adam Mosseri claimed not to be familiar with Meta’s Project MYST, even though a document seemed to indicate he had given his approval to move forward with the study.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We do a lot of research projects,” Mosseri said, after claiming he couldn’t remember anything specific about MYST beyond its name. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the plaintiff’s lawyer pointed to this study as an example of why social media companies should be held accountable for their alleged harms, not the parents. He noted that Kaley’s mother, for example, had tried to stop her daughter’s social media addiction and use, even taking her phone away at times. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, the study found that teens who had a greater number of adverse life experiences — like those dealing with alcoholic parents, harassment at school, or other issues — reported less attentiveness over their social media use. That means that kids facing trauma in their real lives were more at risk of addiction, the lawyer argued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the stand, Mosseri seemed to partially agree with this finding, saying, “There’s a variety of reasons this can be the case. One I’ve heard often is that people use Instagram as a way to escape from a more difficult reality.” Meta is careful not to label any sort of overuse as addiction; instead, Mosseri stated that the company uses the term “problematic use” to refer to someone “spending more time on Instagram than they feel good about.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for Meta, meanwhile, pushed the idea that the study was more narrowly focused on understanding if teens felt they were using social media too much, not whether or not they were actually addicted. They also generally aimed to put more of the responsibility on parents and the realities of life as the catalyst for kids like Kaley’s negative emotional states, not companies’ social media products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/09/tech/instagram-youtube-social-media-trial\">Meta’s lawyers pointed to</a> Kaley being a child of divorced parents, with an abusive father, and facing bullying at school.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How the jury will interpret the findings of studies like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techoversight.org/2026/02/13/adam-mosseri-ig-testimony/\">Project MYST and others</a>, along with the testimonies from both sides, remains to be seen. Mosseri did note, however, that MYST’s findings had not been published publicly, and no warnings were ever issued to teens or parents as a result of the research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has been asked for comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Apple obviously has competition in this space, as other companies—including Meta (which is arguably the most <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/meta-facial-recognition-smart-glasses.html\">successful player</a> when it comes to smart glasses) and Snap (which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">plans to release</a> its “Specs” later this year)—are working on similar products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s new smart glasses, which will supposedly include a high-resolution camera, may see a public release sooner rather than later, with Bloomberg reporting that the company is “targeting the start of production as early as December, ahead of a public release in 2027.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on AirPods with new AI capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of these items will be designed to connect to the iPhone, and will include Siri, the company’s virtual assistant, as a critical component of the user experience, the outlet notes. The glasses are being described as “more upscale and feature-rich” than the AirPods and the AI pendant, however.

Of this, $1 billion is dedicated to early-stage investments, while the rest is for growth-stage investments, according to an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thrivecap.com/thrive-x\">announcement from the firm.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thrive told Bloomberg that this latest fundraise was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-17/josh-kushner-s-thrive-capital-raises-10-billion-in-new-funding?srnd=phx-technology\">oversubscribed</a>. This is the firm’s 10th fund — called Thrive X — and comes as some of the firm’s biggest investments, including OpenAI, Stripe, and SpaceX, continue to soar in value. Some of the firm’s other notable investments include Databricks, Anduril, and Cursor. The firm also incubates companies, having spun up 12 so far, with at least six now having reached unicorn status.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s strategy is to “commit deeply to a small number of founders,” the firm said in its announcement. “Concentration demands loyalty to the founders and missions we back.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speaking to Bloomberg, Josh Kushner, founder of the firm, said he believed the winners of the AI boom would “be bigger than we can ever imagine,” and that the technology is still nascent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thrive’s massive raise also hints at something else. IPO rumors have swirled around OpenAI and SpaceX in particular, bringing considerable interest from limited partners awaiting returns.

Felser noticed it was a common occurrence among startups producing novel materials. Fesler, who previously founded and invested in software startups, said the problem they faced seemed a bit unfair. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Software companies sell at a negative margin all the time in the beginning, you know, Uber, Lyft, you can look at lots of different examples,” he said. “But for materials companies, they they’re not allowed to do that. One of the questions I had is, ‘why is that?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Felser found that unlike software companies, which can quickly add more capacity from cloud service providers, materials startups face a market skeptical of their ability to scale up production without a guaranteed customer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Felser decided to give them one. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Felser doesn’t run a company with a big budget for clever materials, but he knows a few. And as a climate tech investor, he knows more than a few startups that could benefit from a well-known customer. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Felser has been quietly working on a new project, called Material Scale, that brings the two sides together using a hybrid debt-equity investment vehicle to give materials startups a boost, TechCrunch has learned. Material Scale will initially focus on climate tech startups in the apparel industry. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Material Scale is betting on startups with commercial-ready products that are ready to scale if a customer can purchase in bulk. Buyers will commit enough funds to cover the cost of the material at market price. Material Scale will fund the difference through a combination of loans and warrants in the startup. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s really minimally dilutive,” Felser said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ralph Lauren is joining the platform as a buyer for the initial launch of Material Scale. Investor <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.structureclimate.com/\">Structure Climate</a> is joining Climactic as a general partner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Money from purchase orders flows from the buyer through Material Scale to the startup. “In effect, we buy it and then simultaneously sell it,” Felser said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deals between Material Scale and the buyer and between Material Scale and the startup will be inked essentially at the same time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Once they sign the deals, this’ll be interesting because the value of the company has significantly changed because they’ve now got a buyer and they’ve got funding to achieve scale,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Material Scale hasn’t executed any deals yet; Felser said he has large apparel manufacturers interested in participating and a long roster of startups that could use the funding. “The startups all want it,” he said. “We have a big list of companies that are candidates that we’re talking with.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first investments will come out of a special purpose vehicle totaling about $11 million. Felser hopes to eventually branch out into other, similar markets like alternative fuels, eventually growing the Material Scale concept to nine figures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He hopes other investors will steal his idea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We need more novel instruments like this to attack climate change,” he said. “We want to be nimble and be able to take advantage of opportunities when we we see them and not just be doing the same old thing.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The OpenAI competitor has agreed to buy <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.koyeb.com/\">Koyeb</a>, a Paris-based startup that simplifies AI app deployment at scale and manages the infrastructure behind it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mistral has been primarily known for developing large language models (LLMs), but this deal confirms its ambitions to position itself as a full-stack player. In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/MistralAI/status/1932798814840332307\">June 2025</a>, it had announced <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mistral.ai/products/compute\">Mistral Compute</a>, an AI cloud infrastructure offering which it now hopes Koyeb will accelerate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2020 by three former employees of French cloud provider Scaleway, Koyeb aimed to help developers process data <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/koyeb-is-a-serverless-startup-that-ingests-processes-and-stores-data-from-multiple-cloud-providers/\">without worrying about server infrastructure</a> — a concept known as serverless. This approach gained relevance as AI grew more demanding, also inspiring the recent launch of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.koyeb.com/blog/koyeb-sandboxes-fast-scalable-fully-isolated-environments-for-ai-agents\">Koyeb Sandboxes</a>, which provide isolated environments to deploy AI agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before the acquisition, Koyeb’s platform already helped users deploy models from Mistral and others. In a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.koyeb.com/blog/koyeb-is-joining-mistral-ai-to-build-the-future-of-ai-infrastructure\">blog post</a>, Koyeb said its platform will continue operating. But its team and technology will now also help Mistral deploy models directly on clients’ own hardware (on premises), optimize its use of GPUs, and help scale AI inference — the process of running a trained AI model to generate responses — according to a press release from Mistral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, Koyeb’s 13 employees and its three co-founders, Yann Léger, Edouard Bonlieu, and Bastien Chatelard (pictured in 2020), are set to join the engineering team of Mistral, overseen by CTO and co-founder Timothée Lacroix. Under his leadership, Koyeb expects its platform to transition into a “core component” of Mistral Compute over the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Koyeb’s product and expertise will accelerate our development on the Compute front, and contribute to building a true AI cloud,” Lacroix wrote in a statement. Mistral has been ramping up its cloud ambitions. Just a few days ago, the company announced <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/mistral-ai-infrastructure-sweden.html\">a $1.4 billion investment in data centers in Sweden</a> amid growing demand for alternatives to U.S. infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Koyeb had raised <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/koyeb\">$8.6 million to date</a>, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/koyeb-raises-1-6-million-for-its-serverless-data-processing-engine/\">a $1.6 million pre-seed round</a> in 2020, followed in 2023 by a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.koyeb.com/blog/we-raised-7m-to-simplify-app-deployment-with-our-global-serverless-platform\">$7 million seed round</a> led by Paris-based VC firm Serena, whose principal Floriane de Maupeou celebrated the acquisition. For the firm, this combination will play a key role “in building the foundations of sovereign AI infrastructure in Europe,” she told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In part thanks to these geopolitical tailwinds, but also due to its focus on helping enterprises unlock value from AI, Mistral recently passed the milestone of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/664249e7-e8d5-4425-b397-ad3ed590b305\">$400 million in annual recurring revenue</a>.

CEO Brashears, President Ramos, and VP of Product Grown-Haeberli realized the opportunity when designing a new generation of compute-hungry SpaceX satellites forced them to assess the optical transceiver market, and they saw its limitations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Optical transceivers are particularly important for data centers aimed at training and operating large deep learning models, because they allow multiple GPUs to work in concert. One established U.S. supplier, AOI, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/aoi-ramps-its-focus-800g-optics-data-centers\">won a contract</a> worth $4 billion to provide components for AWS data centers last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Someone will brag about a million GPU cluster; you have to multiply by four to five for the number of transceivers in that cluster,” Brashears explained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s goal is to manufacture a thousand units per day within the year so they can begin qualifying for bulk orders in 2027 and 2028.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The optical transceiver market is dominated by Chinese firms and suppliers, and Mesh sees an advantage in building its supply chain outside of that country. While trade restrictions haven’t impacted the market yet, the founders and their backers see themselves as getting in front of a national security dilemma. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If AI is the most important technology in several generations (which we believe to be true), to have critical parts of AI data center capex run through misaligned/competitive countries is a problem,” Thrive Partner Philip Clark wrote TechCrunch. “In the immediate term, Mesh is solving our need for better ways to do interconnect if we want to keep scaling AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The challenge for Mesh, the founders say, is executing lights-out, automated manufacturing techniques, which aren’t common in U.S. industry. So much of this expertise is concentrated in China that even European equipment suppliers expect Chinese customers — one German firm’s standard intake form asks for a Chinese company registration number.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By co-locating design and production, the founders hope to realize more efficient and lower-cost components. Their current design removes one commonly used but power-hungry component, which Ramos said could reduce GPU cluster power usage by 3% to 5%, a meaningful amount as hyperscalers seek to wring as much efficiency out of their systems as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers are just the beginning of Mesh’s aspirations; the company sees optical wavelength communications as the next paradigm in communications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The world has primarily focused on [radio frequencies] for a long time,” Brashears told TechCrunch. “We want to be at the precipice of transition from RF to photonics…we want to interconnect everything, and not just computers, but that’s where we’re starting.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As hyperscalers prepare to build out billions of dollars worth of new data centers, the price for DRAM chips has jumped <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://datatrack.trendforce.com/Chart/content/4694/mainstream-dram-spot-price\">roughly 7x in the last year</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, there’s a growing discipline in orchestrating all that memory to make sure the right data gets to the right agent at the right time. The companies that master it will be able to make the same queries with fewer tokens, which can be the difference between folding and staying in business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/another-conversation-with-val-bercovici\">Semiconductor analyst Doug O’Laughlin</a> has an interesting look at the importance of memory chips on his Substack, where he talks with Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka. They’re both semiconductor guys, so the focus is more on the chips than the broader architecture; the implications for AI software are pretty significant too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I was particularly struck by this passage, in which Bercovici looks at the growing complexity of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching\">Anthropic’s prompt-caching documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tell is if we go to Anthropic’s prompt caching pricing page. It started off as a very simple page six or seven months ago, especially as Claude Code was launching — just “use caching, it’s cheaper.” Now it’s an encyclopedia of advice on exactly how many cache writes to pre-buy. You’ve got 5-minute tiers, which are very common across the industry, or 1-hour tiers — and nothing above. That’s a really important tell. Then of course you’ve got all sorts of arbitrage opportunities around the pricing for cache reads based on how many cache writes you’ve pre-purchased.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question here is how long Claude holds your prompt in cached memory: you can pay for a 5-minute window, or pay more for an hour-long window. It’s much cheaper to draw on data that’s still in the cache, so if you manage it right, you can save an awful lot. There is a catch though: every new bit of data you add to the query may bump something else out of the cache window. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is complex stuff, but the upshot is simple enough: Managing memory in AI models is going to be a huge part of AI going forward. Companies that do it well are going to rise to the top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And there is plenty of progress to be made in this new field. Back in October, I covered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/tensormesh-raises-4-5m-to-squeeze-more-inference-out-of-ai-server-loads/\">a startup called TensorMesh</a> that was working on one layer in the stack known as cache-optimization. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opportunities exist in other parts of the stack. For instance, lower down the stack, there’s the question of how data centers are using the different types of memory they have. (The interview includes a nice discussion of when DRAM chips are used instead of HBM, although it’s pretty deep in the hardware weeds.) Higher up the stack, end users are figuring out how to structure their model swarms to take advantage of the shared cache.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As companies get better at memory orchestration, they’ll use fewer tokens and inference will get cheaper. Meanwhile, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ramp.com/velocity/ai-is-getting-cheaper\">models are getting more efficient at processing each token</a>, pushing the cost down still further. As server costs drop, a lot of applications that don’t seem viable now will start to edge into profitability. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Australia <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/07/as-australia-bans-social-media-for-kids-under-16-age-assurance-tech-is-in-the-spotlight/\">became the first</a> to implement such measures at the end of last year, setting a precedent that other countries are now closely watching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Australia’s regulations, along with other countries’ proposals, aim to reduce the pressures and risks that young users may face on social media, which include cyberbullying, addiction, mental health issues, and exposure to predators. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, there are concerns about privacy regarding invasive age verification and excessive government intervention. Critics, including <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/12/australia-social-media-ban-for-children-and-young-people-an-ineffective-quick-fix-that-will-not-prevent-online-harms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amnesty Tech</a>, have said such bans are ineffective and that they ignore the realities of younger generations. Despite this, many nations are moving ahead with proposed legislation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve compiled a list of countries that are considering or have already moved forward with bans on social media for young users.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-australia\">Australia</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Australia became the world’s first country to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ban social media</a> for children under 16 in December 2025. The ban blocks children from using Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit, Twitch, and Kick. It notably doesn’t include WhatsApp or YouTube Kids. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Australian government has said these social media companies must take steps to keep children off their services. Companies that fail to comply may face penalties of up to $49.5 million AUD ($34.4 million USD).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government says these platforms should use multiple verification methods to ensure that people using their services are older than 16. It also notes that they can’t rely on users simply entering their own age. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-denmark\"><strong>Denmark</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Denmark is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/denmark-social-media-ban-australia-1e96a3df3276cc2033a6f04effb89f51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">set to ban</a> social media platforms for children under 15. The Danish government announced in November 2025 that it had secured support  for the ban from three governing coalition parties and two opposition parties in parliament.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government’s plans could become law as soon as mid-2026, according to the Associated Press. The Danish digital affairs ministry is also launching a “digital evidence” app that includes age verification tools that may be used as part of the ban. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-france\"><strong>France</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In late January, French lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/27/france-social-media-ban-under-15s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">passed a bill</a> that would ban social media for kids under 15. President Emmanuel Macron has supported the measure as a way to protect children from excessive screen time. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bill still has to get through the country’s Senate before a final vote in the lower house.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-germany\"><strong>Germany</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early February, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives discussed a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/germanys-cdu-weighs-social-media-age-curbs-under-16s-2026-02-06/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">proposal to bar</a> children under 16 from using social media, Reuters reported.

The government wants to regulate social networks where content is shared, citing platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-spain\"><strong>Spain</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spain’s prime minister announced in early February that the country <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-hold-social-media-executives-accountable-illegal-hateful-content-2026-02-03/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">plans to ban</a> social media for children under the age of 16. The ban still needs parliamentary approval. The Spanish government is also seeking to create a law that would make social media executives personally accountable for hate speech on their platforms.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-uk\"><strong>UK</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The United Kingdom is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm4xpyxp7lo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">weighing a ban</a> on social media for children under 16. The government says it will consult parents, young people, and civil society for their views to determine whether a ban would be effective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It will also consider whether to require social media companies to limit or remove features that drive compulsive use, such as endless scrolling.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The update, which is initially available to Fire TV owners in the U.S., represents the first major Fire TV redesign in years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes arrive after an explosion of streaming content has made it more difficult to know what’s available to watch on which service, requiring streaming platforms like Fire TV to serve more as a discovery hub than just a tool to launch streaming apps.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/amazon-revamps-fire-tv-launches-its-own-artline-televisions-with-frames/\">first previewed the new design</a> at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, showing off an interface intended to make Fire TV feel less cluttered.

YouTube announced last year that it has more than <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/youtube-surpasses-1-billion-monthly-podcast-viewers/\">1 billion monthly active viewers</a> of podcast content. Spotify said last November that it has half a million video podcasts, which nearly 400 million users have watched.

By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we’re putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the new video experience will officially launch in the spring, the update is available to test starting this week as part of betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and visionOS 26.4.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

To attract investment, the government is rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support aimed at pulling more of the global AI value chain into the South Asian nation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s pitch comes as U.S. technology giants, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/amazon-to-invest-additional-35b-in-india-by-2030-taking-total-planned-spending-to-75b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-to-invest-17-5b-in-india-by-2029-as-ai-race-accelerates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft</a>, have already <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2216901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">committed about $70 billion</a> to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country, giving New Delhi a foundation to argue it can combine scale, cost advantages, and policy incentives to attract the next wave of global AI computing investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the bulk of the projected $200 billion is expected to flow into AI infrastructure — including data centers, chips, and supporting systems, and encompassing the around $70 billion already <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/26/india-ai-google-microsoft-amazon/\">pledged</a> by Big Tech companies — Vaishnaw said the Indian government also anticipates an additional $17 billion of investment into deep-tech and AI applications, highlighting a push to move beyond infrastructure and capture more of the value chain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The effort is backed by recent policy decisions <span>aimed at making India a more attractive base for AI computing, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/india-offers-zero-taxes-through-2047-to-lure-global-ai-workloads/\" target=\"_blank\">long-term tax relief for export-oriented cloud services</a> and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/india-doubles-down-on-state-backed-venture-capital-approving-1-1b-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">₹100 billion (</a>about</span> $1.1 billion) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/india-doubles-down-on-state-backed-venture-capital-approving-1-1b-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">government-backed venture program</a> targeting high-risk areas such as AI and advanced manufacturing. Earlier this month, New Delhi also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/07/india-has-changed-its-startup-rules-for-deep-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">extended the period for which deep-tech companies</a> qualify as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.08 million).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have seen VCs committing funds for dtech startups,” Vaishnaw said at a press briefing on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. “We have seen VCs and other players committing funds for big solutions, big applications. We have seen VCs committing funds for further research in cutting-edge models.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India plans to <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2229171\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">scale its shared compute capacity</a> under the IndiaAI Mission beyond its existing 38,000 GPUs, the minister said, with an additional 20,000 units to be added in the coming weeks, signaling what he described as the next phase of the country’s AI strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, Vaishnaw said the Indian government is preparing a second phase of its AI Mission, with a stronger focus on research and development, innovation, and wider diffusion of AI tools, alongside further expansion of shared compute capacity, as India seeks to broaden access to AI infrastructure beyond a small group of companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The push also faces structural challenges, including access to reliable power and water for energy-intensive data centers, underlining the execution risks as India seeks to compress years of AI infrastructure build-out into a much shorter time frame.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vaishnaw acknowledged those challenges, saying the government was cognizant of the pressure AI infrastructure would place on power and water resources, and pointed to India’s energy mix — with more than half of installed generation capacity coming from clean sources — as an advantage as demand from data centers rises.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether India can deliver on that vision will matter well beyond its borders, as companies seek new locations for AI computing amid rising costs, capacity constraints, and intensifying global competition.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company noted that users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/@findjeremiah?lang=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jeremiah Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/@harryjowsey?lang=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Harry Jowsey</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/@skaijackk?lang=en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Skai Jackson</a>. This will allow users to unlock exclusive content while creating monetization opportunities for creators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscription within the app, while Snap will recommend different tiers to them. The subscription will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and ad-free consumption for that creator’s Stories.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap noted that this is a new way for creators to earn more money besides the existing programs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Expanding on existing monetization offerings like the Unified Monetization Program and the Snap Star Collab Studio, Creator Subscriptions introduce a premium layer of connection directly into how Snapchatters already engage with creators across Stories, Chat, and replies,” the company said in the blog <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-launches-creator-subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat reached 946 million daily active users, according to the company’s Q4 2025 results. The platform noted during its earnings that the number of U.S.-based users posting to Spotlight grew over 47% year-over-year. The company also spun out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/\">hardware to a new entity called Specs last month</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company added that it plans to expand the program to Snap Stars in Canada, the U.K., and France in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rival company Meta also allows creators to offer subscriptions on platforms like <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/856296695055001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Instagram and Facebook</a>, which gives users access to exclusive content and badges.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He, too, had a non-compete, but was noodling on ideas for a company. He knew Heckler, as Akintolayo had once served as an advisor on one of his projects. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this downtime, however, they wanted to come together — Heckler, with his connections, and Akintolayo, with his knowledge of AI and supply chains — to try and build something new. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result was <a href=\"https://spendrule.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SpendRule</a>, launched last summer as an AI-powered platform that helps healthcare systems track their spending. The company emerged from stealth on Tuesday, with $2 million in funding in a round led by Abundant Venture Partners. Others in the round include MemorialCare Innovation Fund and Zeal Capital Partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, if an item has a barcode, health systems use a three-way match, Akintolayo, the company’s CTO, said, which connects a purchase to an invoice. But a lot of the time, health systems have purchases and contracts (such as maintenance, janitorial, translation services, or laundry) that lack bar codes or easily identifiable purchase receipts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because these types of purchases can often be tricky and complex to manage, overspending is quite common. SpendRule is a technology that ensures hospitals pay only what was negotiated in their contracts. It is integrated with and operates on top of a hospital system’s current enterprise resource planning software, contract management software, and accounts payable workflows, pulling information from contracts, invoices, internal databases, and vendor data to validate invoices before payment is released. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It flags discrepancies and tells teams when to pay and when not to. Typically, hospitals hire an auditor every two years to perform this function or manually review each invoice. It was a tedious task bound to be automated in this current wave of AI. Already, big names like Kettering Health, MemorialCare, and MUSC Health are using the platform, Akintolayo said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heckler and Akintolayo started the company only last summer but managed to close a round by Halloween, mainly due to Heckler’s industry connections. “We were able to painlessly close that initial round and use that to grow the team to support the customers,” he said. The new capital will be used to hire and continue developing the company’s AI infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heckler said SpendRule considers existing invoice auditors its competition, such as SpendMend and GHX. But Akintolayo said again, one main difference is SpendRule’s focus on purchase services, the type of items hospitals buy that do not have barcodes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to build a more resilient hospital system,” Akintolayo said. “That’s our vision. To protect the bottom line of everyone by connecting their data and helping them make better decisions.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Emergent claims its users have created over 7 million applications on its platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nearly 40% of Emergent’s users are small businesses, and about 70% have no prior coding experience. People mostly use the platform to digitize operations previously run on spreadsheets, email, or messaging apps, and to build custom software, co-founder and CEO Mukund Jha told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emergent’s rapid growth comes as interest in “vibe-coding,” or using AI to code software, skyrockets around the world. The demand seems to be mostly driven by non-technical users who want to build production-ready applications using natural language and AI agents, though plenty of developers have turned to using such platforms to reduce their workloads. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup competes with the likes of Replit, Lovable, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/\">Rocket.new</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/replika-founder-raises-20m-pre-seed-for-wabi-the-youtube-of-apps/\">Wabi,</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/vibe-coding-startup-anything-nabs-a-100m-valuation-after-hitting-2m-arr-in-its-first-two-weeks/\">Anything</a>, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jha said most users on Emergent are building business-facing apps such as custom CRMs, ERPs, and inventory management and logistics tools. About 80% to 90% of new projects are focused on mobile apps, reflecting demand for software that can be deployed quickly and used on the go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emergent generates revenue through a mix of subscriptions, usage-based pricing, and deployment and hosting fees, Jha said, adding that all three segments are growing rapidly and that the company’s gross margins are improving every month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Growth is accelerating,” Jha told TechCrunch. “As the models and platforms are improving, we’re seeing a lot more users getting to success.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While usage today is dominated by consumers and small businesses, the company has begun testing an enterprise offering, and is running pilots with “a small number of customers” to better understand requirements around security, compliance, and governance, Jha said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. and Europe account for roughly 70% of Emergent’s overall revenue, though India is the startup’s next-largest and fastest-growing market, supported by local pricing that has driven adoption among small businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Emergent on Tuesday also launched a mobile app for iOS and Android that lets users create apps and publish them directly to Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. The app is currently in testing, though its users have already built more than 10,000 applications, the startup said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app lets users type in text prompts or converse with AI using voice to build apps, websites, or platforms. The startup noted that users can also switch between the mobile app and the desktop version without losing context or progress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jha said the mobile launch reflects the platform’s asynchronous, agent-based workflow, where users delegate tasks to AI and return later to review progress. With a growing share of users already accessing the platform via mobile browsers and a large proportion of apps being built for mobile use, he said extending those workflows to a native app was a natural next step.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco-headquartered startup, with an office in Bengaluru, drew attention in January after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/indian-vibe-coding-startup-emergent-raises-70m-at-300m-valuation-from-softbank-khosla-ventures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raising $70 million in a funding round</a> jointly led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Khosla Ventures, less than four months after closing a $23 million Series A. The financing tripled Emergent’s valuation to $300 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The conglomerate is developing large-scale AI data-center campuses in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/google-to-invest-15b-in-indian-ai-infrastructure-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visakhapatnam</a> and Noida, and has plans for more facilities in Hyderabad and Pune. An expanded partnership with Walmart-owned Flipkart will focus on another AI data center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adani said the broader plan calls for deploying up to 5 gigawatts of data-center capacity. The company said the facilities will be developed as a unified system that would scale power generation and processing capacity in parallel.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The effort builds on AdaniConneX, a joint venture between Adani Enterprises and U.S.-based EdgeConneX, a developer and operator of data centers for hyperscale and enterprise customers. The JV, Adani said, has already developed about 2 gigawatts of data-center capacity across India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Central to the strategy is Adani’s renewable-energy portfolio, which the group said will supply carbon-neutral power to the data centers. The company pointed to its 30-gigawatt Khavda renewable project in western India — more than 10 gigawatts of which is already operational — and said it plans to invest an additional $55 billion to expand renewable generation and battery energy storage over the coming years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To reduce exposure to global supply-chain disruptions, Adani said it plans to co-invest in domestic manufacturing of critical components, such as transformers, power electronics and thermal management systems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adani did not respond to questions about how much of the $100 billion investment is already committed capital, how the spending will be phased over the coming years, and when the first large-scale AI workloads are expected to become operational.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This allows users to cancel their bookings if there is a change of plans without losing money up front.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company launched the feature in the U.S. last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/airbnb-will-allow-us-users-to-book-stays-without-paying-up-front/\">for domestic travel</a>. Airbnb said that properties with a “flexible” or “moderate” cancellation policy are eligible for the upfront reservation. With this option, users get charged closer to their check-in date rather than at the time of booking. The feature mirrors “buy now, pay later” payment plans that have become popular in e-commerce, making expensive travel more accessible by spreading out costs. The company noted that since the launch, the feature saw 70% adoption for eligible bookings.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?w=351\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036917\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg 978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=77,150 77w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=155,300 155w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=768,1489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=351,680 351w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=619,1200 619w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=660,1280 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=222,430 222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=371,720 371w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=464,900 464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=413,800 413w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=792,1536 792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=345,668 345w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=193,375 193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=318,617 318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=274,531 274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/First-time-booker-Pay-now-Airbnb.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Airbnb</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During its earnings calls for Q4 2025, Airbnb said that the feature helped grow nights booked in the quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Reserve Now, Pay Later saw significant adoption among eligible guests in Q4. It’s also led to longer booking lead times and a mix shift towards larger entire homes, especially those with four or more bedrooms, contributing to the increase in average daily rate,” Ellie Mertz, CFO of Airbnb, said during the call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mertz noted that Airbnb’s overall cancellation rate jumped from 16% to 17% for the quarter, and it was higher among customers who use the upfront booking product. However, she said that this was “not hugely material relative to the broader cancellations on the platform.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, the company surveyed U.S. travelers along with Focaldata, a London-based market research and polling company. Of those surveyed, 60% of participants said that a flexible payment option is important while booking a holiday, and 55% said they would use a flexible payment option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been experimenting with pay-later products for years now. Back in 2018, Airbnb launched a product that allowed users to book a property by paying <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/airbnb-now-lets-users-pay-less-up-front-for-bookings/\">20% or 50% of the total charges</a> up front, with the rest due later. In 2023, the company partnered with fintech firm Klarna to let users pay for their stays in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/03/airbnbs-average-home-prices-have-gone-up-so-now-its-refocusing-on-rooms-to-give-users-more-affordable-alternatives/\">four installments over six weeks</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
