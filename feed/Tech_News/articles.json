Flexible policies let users cancel their reservation up to 24 hours before they check-in, while moderate policies allow for no-fee cancellations until five days before check-in.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users will need to pay the full amount for their booking before the listing’s free cancellation period ends.

Babuschkin led engineering teams at xAI and helped build the startup into one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI model developers just a few years after it was founded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023,” Babuschkin wrote in the post. “I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Babuschkin is leaving xAI to launch his own venture capital firm, Babuschkin Ventures, which he says will support AI safety research and back startups that “advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The xAI co-founder says he was inspired to start the firm after a dinner with Max Tegmark, the founder of the Future of Life Institute, in which they discussed how AI systems could be built safely to encourage the flourishing of future generations. In his post, Babuschkin says his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Russia in pursuit of a better life for their children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Babuschkin’s departure comes after a tumultuous few months for xAI, in which the company became engrossed in several scandals related to its AI chatbot Grok. For instance, Grok was found to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-4-seems-to-consult-elon-musk-to-answer-controversial-questions/\">cite Musk’s personal opinions</a> when trying to answer controversial questions. In another case, xAI’s chatbot went on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/grok-is-being-antisemitic-again-and-also-the-sky-is-blue/\">antisemitic rants</a> and called itself “Mechahitler.” Most recently, xAI unveiled a new feature in Grok that allowed users to make AI-generated videos <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/report/718975/xai-grok-imagine-taylor-swifty-deepfake-nudes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">resembling nude public figures</a>, such as Taylor Swift.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These scandals have at times overshadowed the performance of xAI’s models, which are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/\">state-of-the-art</a> on several benchmarks compared to AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to co-founding xAI, Babuschkin was part of a research team at Google DeepMind that pioneered AlphaStar in 2019, a breakthrough AI system that could defeat top-ranked players at the video game StarCraft. Babuschkin also worked as a researcher at OpenAI in the years before it released ChatGPT.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his post, Babuschkin details some of the challenges he and Musk faced in building up xAI. He notes that industry veterans called xAI’s goal of building its Memphis, Tennessee supercomputer in just three months “impossible.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xAI was able to build its AI supercomputer in record time, however, <a href=\"https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">environmentalists warn</a> that the temporary gas turbines powering the cluster are pumping out emissions into neighboring communities and exacerbating their longstanding health issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevertheless, Babuschkin says he’s already looking back fondly on his time at xAI, and “feels like a proud parent, driving away after sending their kid away to college.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency,” said Babuschkin.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m riding in the back of a Waymo that’s autonomously navigating the busy streets of San Francisco with relative ease thanks to 29 external cameras, six radar, and five lidar sensors all feeding into an AI model. For just 15 bucks, I get to experience what feels like a miracle of modern technology, and yet, there’s a nagging thought I can’t shake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The music sucks in here.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s music-streaming feature has felt like an aged barnacle attached to a futuristic shell. Until this week, passengers were limited to a few music stations that played lo-fi beats, smooth jazz, K-pop, or other genres they may or may not care for. For those who wanted to listen to something more specific, they had to use another app from Waymo’s parent company Alphabet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For iPhone users, that meant downloading the Google Assistant app and configuring it to connect to Spotify. At that point, you had to ask Google Assistant through written or verbal commands to stream certain songs, artists, or playlists on the Waymo. Even if you get to this point — at which you may be halfway to your destination and have listened to approximately three lo-fi beats — the service didn’t work reliably.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As I rode along in a robotaxi full of cutting-edge technology, I was puzzled why Waymo had not figured out a simple way to stream music from my phone into the car’s speakers — a breakthrough that automakers and audio manufacturers figured out a couple of decades ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s why I was pleasantly surprised this week to see that Waymo launched a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waymo.com/music/\">Spotify integration</a> allowing users to seamlessly link the music-streaming and robotaxi-hailing services. I immediately connected the services and hailed a Waymo to see how it would work.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036502\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg 4284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2420_b893a8.jpg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Listening to Spotify in a Waymo.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Maxwell Zeff</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s Spotify integration is nothing groundbreaking, but it adds to the user experience. It works seamlessly, which is roughly what I would expect when trying to play music on my car’s speakers in 2025. But riding around in a Waymo, listening to my own playlist or picking up where I left off on a podcast, the back seat of the robotaxi feels more like my own space — which is increasingly the reason I opt for a Waymo.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To set it up, open the Waymo app and navigate to the “Music” section, where you will notice a new offering that lets you connect to Spotify. From there, you can press a button and authorize Spotify to connect to Waymo, albeit while giving the robotaxi provider some access to your listening information.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?w=330\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036461\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=768,1581 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=330,680 330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=583,1200 583w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=622,1280 622w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=209,430 209w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=350,720 350w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=437,900 437w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=389,800 389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=746,1536 746w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=995,2048 995w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=182,375 182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=300,617 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=258,531 258w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2413_9113c2.jpg?resize=24,50 24w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Maxwell Zeff (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?w=338\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036462\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=149,300 149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=768,1544 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=338,680 338w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=597,1200 597w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=637,1280 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=214,430 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=358,720 358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=448,900 448w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=398,800 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=764,1536 764w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=1019,2048 1019w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=332,668 332w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=187,375 187w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=307,617 307w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=264,531 264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2414.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Maxwell Zeff (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m sure Apple Music users will soon want to stream their music and podcasts in Waymos as well.

The subsidiary lists Sanka and Rapido vice president of finance Vivek Krishna as the directors, per the regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanka said there was no specific reason for setting up the subsidiary. However, it may be a strategic move to avoid potential conflicts of interest with Swiggy, which currently holds a 12% minority stake in the ride-hailing startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swiggy recently <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/swiggy-re-evaluate-rapido-stake-potential-conflict-of-interest-food-delivery-quick-commerce-zepto-ownly-startup-11753962658356.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">confirmed</a> in a letter to shareholders that it would reevaluate its investment in Rapido, citing a potential conflict of interest “that may arise in the future.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Rapido’s Ownly has also <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ownly.customer&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> its Android app on Google Play that offers food from nearby restaurants at around 15% lower prices than those on Swiggy and Zomato.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036641\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=680,412 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=1200,726 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=1280,775 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=430,260 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=720,436 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=900,545 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=800,484 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=1536,930 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=668,404 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=620,375 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=1019,617 1019w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=708,428 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ownly-rapido-food-delivery_c5e921.jpg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Rapido’s Ownly Food delivery app.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ownly</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lower pricing is a result of Rapido’s model of not taking commissions from restaurants, which are up to 30% in the case of other food delivery apps, including Swiggy and Zomato, and instead charging a fixed fee per order.

The company is using its two-wheeler fleet to deliver food — alongside offering its taxi and courier services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rapido will avoid showing restaurants located far from customers to reduce fuel costs and delivery times, and will curate menu items on its app to maximize margins while offering enough discoverability, a Rapido investor told TechCrunch on condition of anonymity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While handling deliveries for Swiggy, Rapido gained insight into peak hours and high-demand restaurants — the data it would now leverage for its own food delivery service, the investor said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The agreement with Swiggy does not prevent Rapido from using this data, although it does prohibit the startup from entering into contracts with Zomato or other competitors, the investor added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2015, Rapido began as a bike taxi aggregator before expanding into auto rickshaws, parcel delivery, and third-party logistics. In 2023, it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/26/rapido-cabs-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entered the cab business</a> to take on Uber and local rival Ola. The startup gained traction in this segment with its subscription-based model, positioning it as an alternative to the commission-based approach used by its competitors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rapido also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/16/gogoro-delays-india-plans-due-to-policy-uncertainty-launches-bike-taxi-pilot-with-rapido/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnered with Taiwanese battery-swapping electric two-wheeler maker Gogoro</a> to deploy its vehicles as bike taxis. Moreover, the recent moves helped the startup boost its valuation and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/29/indias-rapido-becomes-unicorn-with-fresh-120-million-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">become a unicorn</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s online food delivery market is <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/online-food-delivery-market-to-grow-18-on-year-to-rs-2-lakh-crore-by-2030-bain-report/articleshow/111452013.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">projected to surpass ₹2 trillion</a> (approximately $23 billion) by 2030, per a report by Bain &amp; Company and Swiggy released last year.

Uber was also among the early players in the space with Uber Eats, which it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sold to Zomato in early 2020</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Rapido has raised $574 million in 13 rounds, <a href=\"https://tracxn.com/d/companies/rapido/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">per</a> Tracxn.

The Meta-owned social network confirmed to TechCrunch that Picks is an internal prototype and isn’t being tested externally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature was first spotted by <a href=\"https://x.com/alex193a/status/1953149516015911097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953149516015911097%7Ctwgr%5Eacc2de4306c55733f92bcddbab1fa9a436c57549%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D3036648action%3Dedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to screenshots shared by Paluzzi, people select their favorite movies, books, TV shows, games, and music, or their “Picks.” Instagram then finds overlaps with friends who chose the same things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Instagram hasn’t shared any details about the feature, the company likely views Picks as a way for users to connect more personally with friends and spark conversations around shared interests. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instagram head Adam Mosseri said earlier this year that the social network was going to focus on creativity and connection in 2025. “To help people connect with friends over the things they discover on Instagram, we’re going to double down on messaging, make consuming content more interactive and social, and explore new ways to connect with friends,” Mosseri wrote in a January <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DExLMjZzfdv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Instagram post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, not everyone will welcome Picks, as it adds yet another feature to an already overcrowded app. Instagram is facing backlash following the launch of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/how-to-use-instagram-map-and-protect-your-privacy/\">Instagram Map</a>, with many <a href=\"https://x.com/__Living__Well/status/1953404258297979080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">users saying</a> they <a href=\"https://x.com/_stxrg1rl_/status/1953480951025021282\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">never wanted</a> the feature in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with any other feature in development, it’s not known when or if Instagram plans to officially roll out Picks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He also said his company worked with Foxconn to “build up inventory” before the sale of the factory, noting his startup has “enough to meet customer demand for the next 12 months, along with ample spare parts.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more about our plans to introduce more Monarch-enabled products in the market through new manufacturing partnerships,” Penmetsa wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Following the sale, SoftBank is expected to work with Foxconn to use the factory to make equipment for the Stargate AI project led by OpenAI and Oracle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Foxconn purchased the former General Motors factory from EV startup Lordstown Motors in 2022. Young Liu, Foxconn’s chairman, said prior to the sale closing that the facility was  going to be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&amp;D hub in North America.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Monarch was one of four companies Foxconn promoted as customers (or potential customers) of the electric vehicle contract manufacturing operation it tried to establish at the former General Motors factory. Foxconn built a few hundred tractors for Monarch at the plant, but the startup has struggled. Last year, it went through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/monarch-tractor-lays-off-10-in-restructuring-towards-software-and-licensing-av-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two rounds of layoffs</a> and had to quickly pivot to new types of customers as California’s wine industry crashed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The other three companies Foxconn wanted to build vehicles for have all filed for bankruptcy. While Foxconn made a handful of Lordstown Motors pickups at the plant, the startup went under in 2023. The other two prospective customers were Fisker Inc. and a small California startup called IndiEV. Foxconn never built any vehicles for those companies at the factory, and they have also both since gone out of business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Now the agency is shifting to buying connectivity as a service, much like it does for launch and astronaut transport.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That pivot has sparked a race, with major contenders pitching ways to keep Mars missions online. What’s at stake isn’t a single contract: it’s the data pipe to Mars.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new approach, which will mix NASA assets and commercial infrastructure, would gradually replace the patchwork relay network the agency relies on today. Generally, that works by orbiters like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN that pick up data from rovers and landers and transmit it to the Deep Space Network’s (DSN) giant antennas on Earth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NASA’s relay spacecraft are still healthy, but they were never meant to be a permanent backbone. The <a href=\"https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/psd/resources/senior-review/2025/PMSR25_Final_Report_Package_June9_2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">agency’s latest senior review</a> on planetary missions calls out MAVEN’s critical role as a relay and provides steps to keep it available into the early 2030s. But eventually, this hardware will decay.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program, which manages the DSN, is looking for solutions to augment these aging assets. The aim, according to an RFP released in July and due today, is to create an interoperable marketplace where NASA can be one of many customers instead of the owner-operator.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The current request is specifically for capability studies, not immediate hardware buys. The ask is twofold: a “lunar trunkline” between the moon and Earth and end-to-end Mars communications that move data from assets on the surface, through Mars orbit, and to operations centers on Earth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a formidable challenge. Any architecture must contend with the vast distance between Earth and the moon and Mars, long latency, periodic solar interference and Earth visibility windows, and high requirements for fault-tolerant systems. That’s why NASA is asking for plans, to gauge how industry might solve these puzzles, rather than immediately jumping to procurement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While TechCrunch can’t confirm which companies are submitting concept proposals, a handful have already staked their place in the race. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blue Origin <a href=\"https://x.com/blueorigin/status/1955405386795614666\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">just unveiled</a> a Mars Telecommunications Orbiter built on its Blue Ring platform, pitched as maneuverable, high-performance spacecraft to support NASA missions to Mars as soon as 2028. Rocket Lab has touted its own Mars telecom orbiter concept, <a href=\"https://rocketlabcorp.com/missions/mars-comms-orbiter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">which the company says</a> is a core element of its proposed architecture for the Mars Sample Return campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, NASA’s Mars Exploration Program <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/nasa-orders-studies-from-private-space-companies-on-mars-mission-support-roles/\">separately funded 12 short commercial services studies</a>, including a trio of studies for next-gen relay services, to SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, and Blue Origin. SpaceX’s proposal to “adapt Earth-orbit communication satellites for Mars” will likely be derived from its Starlink internet satellite constellation.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The long-term goal is to transform the agency’s planetary exploration agenda from pure-science missions to a permanent human presence on the moon and, eventually, on Mars.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It can also do “beat analysis” to shape the writing in a way to makes it more engaging for an audio series of a particular genre. The tool additionally has basic chatbot-style writing features such as “shorten,” “expand,” and the ability to generate text via a prompt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To build CoPilot, the company examined thousands of hours of data points to understand what makes users engage more with a particular storyline in a specific genre. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on that, it added writing suggestion features designed to increase conflict between characters and recommend endings for an episode to make it more exciting. AI can also suggest tags for background effects that can be used while producing the audio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tool can automatically generate bios of characters, their relationships, and summarize plot points of different episodes, allowing creators to refer back to these details while writing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CoPilot also has a review tool, which checks for plot points, grammar, and leaves qualitative feedback through comments on an episode.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the hood, Pocket FM is training smaller models to maintain context for a story for character arcs and relations, along with narrative consistency.

The company’s co-founder, Prateek Dixit, said that when it switches to its own LLM, it won’t need to train a ton of small models for separate features.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-s-potential-downsides\">AI’s potential downsides</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adopting AI has had its side effects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pocket FM has already laid off people who were employees or contractors <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/pocket-fm-to-lay-off-75-employees-amid-push-for-profitability-12912308.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">across</a> <a href=\"https://inc42.com/buzz/lightspeed-backed-pocket-fm-fires-around-200-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/business/brandwagon-pocket-fm-lays-off-50-employees-3637706/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rounds</a> in the last 12 months. There have also been reports of writers seeing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24317729/pocket-fm-audio-stories-creators-insta-millionaire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">diminished returns</a> over time. And the company is facing <a href=\"https://themorningcontext.com/internet/pocket-fm-faces-multiple-legal-complaints-in-the-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lawsuits in California over employment and wage issues</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Like most content-led industries, we work with a diverse network of writers, voice artists, and production partners on a project basis, tailoring resources to each market. AI has had minimal impact on our core creative community; instead, it has opened new avenues to expand reach and output,” a company rep said, in response to these layoffs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are questions around quality, as well. The company measures quality by the retention numbers of a show. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The base argument is that the new AI tools act as a writers’ room even for solo creators, so they will be able to produce more content at a rapid rate. Plus, based on the numbers, writers can quickly edit the story with the help of AI. However, these tools can very well induce “AI slop” — or low-quality, AI-generated content — into the platform and could impact a user’s recommendations, making it difficult for them to discover good stories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pocket FM argues that stories that have a solid structure will gain popularity, despite AI helping them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company noted that every piece of content is reviewed by its AI-powered moderation framework to ensure quality and originality. It also claims its AI moderation checks for things like duplication, copyright issues, content health, and other quality measures before approving audio to go live. Each show receives an equal push, and user engagement ultimately determines a show’s ranking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another concern is that writers could become overly dependent on AI over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Germany, AI is writing more content than humans per show for select titles. With Pocket FM’s plans to roll out more AI tools, the amount of AI-written content could increase. And with that, the expectation of churning out more shows could rise, too. Unless user adoption also rises rapidly, average returns could drop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company didn’t directly address TechCrunch’s questions about returns, but said that its AI tools can speed up a writer’s work and help them edit an episode based on numbers and audience feedback. That is they could make targeted improvements, instead of doing a full rewrite. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This way, faster content creation doesn’t necessarily dilute quality or relevance; it just shifts the writer’s role towards editing, refining, and steering more productive output,” a spokesperson said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Humanloop’s three co-founders — CEO Raza Habib, CTO Peter Hayes, and CPO Jordan Burgess — have all joined Anthropic, alongside around a dozen engineers and researchers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-revenue-hits-4-billion-annual-pace-competition-cursor-intensifies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growing fast</a> in the enterprise space as it leads in agentic and coding capabilities. While an Anthropic spokesperson confirmed that the AI firm did not acquire Humanloop’s assets or its intellectual property, that’s a moot point in an industry where IP lives in the brain. And what Humanloop’s team is bringing to Anthropic is experience developing the tools that help enterprises run safe, reliable AI at scale.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or as Brad Abrams, API product lead at Anthropic, put it: “Their proven experience in AI tooling and evaluation will be invaluable as we continue to advance our work in AI safety and building useful AI systems.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a market where model quality alone isn’t enough to stay competitive, bolstering its tooling ecosystem could position Anthropic to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/\">cement its lead over OpenAI and Google DeepMind</a> in both performance and enterprise readiness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humanloop was founded in 2020 as a University College London spinout. The startup then went on to participate in Y Combinator and the Fuse Incubator before raising $7.91 million in seed funding across two rounds led by YC and Index Ventures, per PitchBook. Humanloop gained a reputation for helping enterprise customers — including Duolingo, Gusto, and Vanta — develop, evaluate, and fine-tune robust AI applications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, Humanloop told customers that it would be shutting down in preparation for an acquisition.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of this acqui-hire comes as Anthropic offers features like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/anthropics-claude-ai-model-can-now-handle-longer-prompts/\">longer context windows</a> to enterprise clients, improving what its models are capable of and where they can be applied.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this week, Anthropic reached a deal with the U.S. government’s central purchasing arm to sell its AI services to government agencies across executive, judiciary, and legislative branches for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/anthropic-takes-aim-at-openai-offers-claude-to-all-three-branches-of-government-for-1/\">just $1 per agency</a> for the first year — a clear move to undercut OpenAI’s similarly priced offering. Both government and enterprise buyers demand the type of evaluation, monitoring, and compliance features that Humanloop specialized in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The acquisition is also on brand for Anthropic as it bills itself as a “safety-first” AI company. Humanloop’s evaluation workflows align with that mission by providing constant performance measurement, safety guardrails, and bias mitigation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“From our earliest days, we’ve been focused on creating tools that help developers build AI applications safely and effectively,” said Raza Habib, former CEO of Humanloop, in a statement. “Anthropic’s commitment to AI safety research and responsible AI development perfectly aligns with our vision.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

It gave him an interest for both sides of healthcare: the medicine and business sides, he told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So he went to the annual conference hosted by famed physician-scientist Dr. Daniel Kraft to learn about new tech that could improve results while lowering costs. Dr. Peter Diamandis, founder and chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, was on stage that year with Dr. Bob Hariri, a stem-cell pioneer and co-founder of several health techs like genomics company Human Longevity, Kapp said. They discussed genomics, microbiomics, and new tech that wasn’t part of mainstream medicine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inspired, Kapp went back to his home town of Naples, Florida, and “started a thing called Longevity Performance Center. The idea was to do early detection and then optimization of people’s health,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In March 2020, Diamandis (pictured above) and his buddy Tony Robbins heard of Kapp’s center and visited. They had a stem cell startup called Fountain Therapeutics. Conversation soon turned toward a merger, and by October that year, the two companies became <a href=\"https://www.fountainlife.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fountain Life</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kapp remained CEO with both Diamandis and Robbins as his co-founders and board members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today his board also includes Hariri as an adviser; Todd Wanek, CEO of Ashley Furniture Industries, as an investor; and wealthy Indian business mogul B.K. Modi as an investor as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fountain Life tells TechCrunch exclusively that it just raised an $18 million Series B, led by EOS Ventures, with participation from most of the existing members of the board. Fountain previously raised an $80 million Series A and has raised about $108 million total, Kapp said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Longevity as a subject of serious study by the medical community is a new field. When Kapp (pictured below) first launched his center, “We didn’t know exactly what longevity meant,” he said. But over the last four or five years, much more research has been done. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first principle of longevity, he said, is “don’t die of anything stupid.” Therefore, Fountain Life’s centers, of which there are four today, have a heavy focus on prevention screening, looking for illnesses and chronic conditions at their earliest stages when they tend to be asymptomatic. Blood tests and body scans gather data on over 100 biomarkers, from liver fat to “microbiome concentrations,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second principal is optimization, meaning improving those markers with scientifically validated treatments, he said. And the third principal is “using the latest regenerative therapies under FDA trials,” to treat illness or achieve optimization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Screening tests may discover, for example, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which, left untreated, may lead to certain cancers, he said. The solution, if caught early, is to restore microbiome balance with specific, prescribed microbiotics.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Fountain Life co-founder CEO Dr. William Kapp\" class=\"wp-image-3036347\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg 938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dr.-William-Kapp.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Dr. William Kapp</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Fountain Life</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Fountain’s members, testing is repeated every quarter or so, and patients can track results and ask questions of an AI-powered app called Zori.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s pricey, Kapp admitted. A full subscription costs $21,500 a year, which covers a barrage of tests and access to a physician but doesn’t cover extended medical care. For $10,500, a patient can get just the testing process and AI, but not ongoing tests and medical support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Kapp remembers two stories that told him this work was on the right track. The wife of a Robbins fan bought a membership for her husband, and the tests caught early-stage, asymptomatic kidney cancer. The husband is now cancer-free. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When global hotelier Sam Nazarian was exploring a partnership with Fountain to <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-hotelier-sam-nazarian--global-business-icon-tony-robbins-partner-to-announce-the-estate-a-revolutionary-luxury-hospitality--residential-ecosystem-anchored-in-the-world-of-preventative-medicine-ai-and-longevity-302252505.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">put longevity centers in luxury hotels</a>, Nazarian did Fountain’s tests and found a brain aneurysm. They successfully treated it, Nazarian has <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/therealdeal_salonseries-activity-7315381878507593729-0a2v/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">publicly said.</a> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kapp says the new funding will allow the company to open more centers. In addition to Naples, they opened facilities in Orlando, Dallas, and Westchester, New York; a center in Houston will open in December. Centers in Los Angeles and Miami are planned for Q2 of 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He hopes to solve the affordability issue by working on “clinic development” where Fountain trains medical facilities on its methodologies. Kapp says that as the tech and expertise become more widely available, this will drive down costs for access.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fountain is not the only doctor-driven longevity testing startup. Famed functional health doctor Mark Hyman has a company called <a href=\"https://www.functionhealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Function Health</a>. It offers a package of about 160 blood tests, with follow-up tests every three to six months, for a $500/year membership (with additional fees for additional blood tests). Its platform similarly analyzes and tracks test results, although it doesn’t include access to physicians. That price doesn’t include full body scans but in May Function <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/function-health-acquires-ezra-introduces-499-full-body-mri-scan-302446016.html\">acquired</a> a body-scan company called Ezra and now, for an additional fee starting at $499, offers scans as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: Fountain has clarified the price of the annual subscription and that information has been updated.

But much like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/dating-safety-app-tea-breached-exposing-72000-user-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tea, the dating-gossip app for women</a> it was trying to replicate, TeaOnHer had gaping holes in its security that exposed its users’ personal information, including photos of their driver’s licenses and other government-issued identity documents, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/a-rival-tea-app-for-men-is-leaking-its-users-personal-data-and-drivers-licenses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch reported</a> last week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These gated community-like apps were created ostensibly to let users share information about their relationships under the guise of personal safety. However, shoddy coding and security flaws highlight the ongoing privacy risks inherent in requiring users to submit sensitive information to use apps and websites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such risks are only going to worsen; popular apps and web services are already having to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/reddit-rolls-out-age-verification-in-the-uk-to-comply-with-new-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comply with age-verification laws</a> that require people to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/youtube-rolls-out-age-estimatation-tech-to-identify-u-s-teens-and-apply-additional-protections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">submit their identity documents</a> before they can be granted access to adult-themed content, despite the privacy and security risks associated with storing databases of people’s personal information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch published our story last week, we did not publish specific details of the bugs we discovered in TeaOnHer, erring on the side of caution so as to not help bad actors exploit the bug. Instead, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/a-rival-tea-app-for-men-is-leaking-its-users-personal-data-and-drivers-licenses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">we decided to publish a limited disclosure</a>, because of the app’s rising popularity and the immediate risks that users faced when using the app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of the time of disclosure, TeaOnHer was No. 2 in the free app charts on the Apple App Store, a position still held by the app today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flaws we found appear to be resolved. TechCrunch can now share how we were able to find users’ driver’s licenses within 10 minutes of being sent a link to the app in the App Store, thanks to easy to find flaws in the app’s public-facing backend system, or API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app’s developer, Xavier Lampkin, did not respond to multiple requests for comment after we submitted details of the security flaws, nor would Lampkin commit to notifying affected TeaOnHer users or state regulators of the security lapse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We also asked Lampkin if any security reviews were carried out before the TeaOnHer app was launched, but we got no reply. (We have more on disclosure later on.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alright, start the clock.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-teaonher-exposed-admin-panel-credentials\">TeaOnHer exposed ‘admin panel’ credentials</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before we even downloaded the app, we first wanted to find out where TeaOnHer was hosted on the internet by looking at its public-facing infrastructure, such as its website and anything hosted on its domain.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is usually a good place to start as it helps understand what other services the domain is connected to on the internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To find the domain name, we first looked (by chance) at the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250812173917/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teaonher-dating-advice/id6749215648?platform=iphone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">app’s listing on the Apple App Store</a> to find the app’s website. This can usually be found in its privacy policy, which apps must include before Apple will list them. (The app listing also claims the developer “does not collect any data from this app,” which is demonstrably false, so take that as you will.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TeaOnHer’s privacy policy was in the form of a published Google Doc, which included an email address with a <code>teaonher.com</code> domain, but no website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The website wasn’t public at the time, so with no website loading, we looked at the domain’s public-facing DNS records, which can help to identify what else is hosted on the domain, such as the type of email servers or web hosting. We also wanted to look for any public subdomains that the developer might use to host functionality for the app (or host other resources that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/08/sorry-i-gatecrashed-your-zoom-meeting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">should probably not be public</a>), such as admin dashboards, databases, or other web-facing services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But when we looked at the TeaOnHer’s public internet records, it had no meaningful information other than a single subdomain, <code>appserver.teaonher.com</code>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When we opened this page in our browser, what loaded was the landing page for TeaOnHer’s API (for the curious, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26048764-teaonher-api-backend-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">we uploaded a copy here</a>). An API simply allows things on the internet to communicate with each other, such as linking an app to its central database.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was on this landing page that we found the exposed email address and plaintext password (which <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26048764-teaonher-api-backend-page/#document/p1/a2666767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wasn’t that far off “password”</a>) for Lampkin’s account to access the TeaOnHer “admin panel.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The API page showed that the admin panel, used for the document verification system and user management, was located at “localhost,” which simply refers to the physical computer running the server and may not have been directly accessible from the internet. It’s unclear if anyone could have used the credentials to access the admin panel, but this was in itself a sufficiently alarming finding.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this point, we were only about two minutes in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Otherwise, the API landing page didn’t do much other than offer some indication as to what the API can do. The page listed several API endpoints, which the app needs to access in order to function, such as retrieving user records from TeaOnHer’s database, for users to leave reviews, and sending notifications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With knowledge of these endpoints, it can be easier to interact with the API directly, as if we were imitating the app itself. Every API is different, so learning how an API works and how to communicate with one can take time to figure out, such as which endpoints to use and the parameters needed to effectively speak its language. Apps like Postman can be helpful for accessing and interacting directly with APIs, but this requires time and a certain degree of trial and error (and patience) to make APIs spit out data when they shouldn’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But in this case, there was an even easier way. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-teaonher-api-allowed-unauthenticated-access-to-user-data\">TeaOnHer API allowed unauthenticated access to user data</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This API landing page included <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26048764-teaonher-api-backend-page/#document/p1/a2666752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an endpoint called <code>/docs</code></a>, which contained the API’s auto-generated documentation (powered by a product called Swagger UI) that contained the full list of commands that can be performed on the API. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This documentation page was effectively a master sheet of all the actions you can perform on the TeaOnHer API as a regular app user, and more importantly, as the app’s administrator, such as creating new users, verifying users’ identity documents, moderating comments, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The API documentation also featured the ability to query the TeaOnHer API and return user data, essentially letting us retrieve data from the app’s backend server and display it in our browser.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it’s not uncommon for developers to publish their API documentation, the problem here was that some API requests could be made without any authentication — no passwords or credentials were needed to return information from the TeaOnHer database. In other words, you could run commands on the API to access users’ private data that should not have been accessible to a user of the app, let alone anyone on the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this was conveniently and publicly documented for anyone to see.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Requesting a list of users currently in the TeaOnHer identity verification queue, for example — no more than pressing a button on the API page, nothing fancy here — would return dozens of account records on people who had recently signed up to TeaOnHer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The records returned from TeaOnHer’s server contained users’ unique identifiers within the app (essentially a string of random letters and numbers), their public profile screen name, and self-reported age and location, along with their private email address. The records also included web address links containing photos of the users’ driver’s licenses and corresponding selfies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Worse, these photos of driver’s licenses, government-issued IDs, and selfies were stored in an Amazon-hosted S3 cloud server set as publicly accessible to anyone with their web addresses. This public setting lets anyone with a link to someone’s identity documents open the files from anywhere with no restrictions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg\" alt=\"Two driver's licenses, one from Texas and the other from Massachusetts, redacted by TechCrunch, which were exposed by the TeaOnHer app.\" class=\"wp-image-3036325\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg 1995w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=1200,617 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=1280,658 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=430,221 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=720,370 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=900,462 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=800,411 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=1536,789 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=668,343 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=1201,617 1201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=708,364 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/redacted-pii-tea-on-her-app-flat.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1995px) 100vw, 1995px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Two driver’s licenses (redacted by TechCrunch) exposed by the flaws in the TeaOnHer app</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that unique user identifier, we could also use the API page to directly look up individual users’ records, which would return their account data and any of their associated identity documents. With uninhibited access to the API, a malicious user could have scraped huge amounts of user data from the app, much like what happened with <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/women-dating-safety-app-tea-breached-users-ids-posted-to-4chan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Tea app to begin with</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From bean to cup, that was about 10 minutes, and we hadn’t even logged-in to the app yet. The bugs were so easy to find that it would be sheer luck if nobody malicious found them before we did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We asked, but Lampkin would not say if he has the technical ability, such as logs, to determine if anyone had used (or misused) the API at any time to gain access to users’ verification documents, such as by scraping web addresses from the API.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the days since our report to Lampkin, the API landing page has been taken down, along with its documentation page, and it now displays only the state of the server that the TeaOnHer API is running on as “healthy.” At least on cursory tests, the API now appears to rely on authentication, and the previous calls made using the API no longer work. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The web addresses containing users’ uploaded identity documents have also been restricted from public view. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TeaOnHer developer dismissed efforts to disclose flaws</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that TeaOnHer had no official website at the time of our findings, TechCrunch contacted the email address listed on the privacy policy in an effort to disclose the security lapses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the email bounced back with an error saying the email address couldn’t be found. We also tried contacting Lampkin through the email address on his website, Newville Media, but our email bounced back with the same error message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch reached Lampkin via LinkedIn message, asking him to provide an email address where we could send details of the security flaws. Lampkin responded with a general “support” email address.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch discloses a security flaw, we reach out to confirm first that a person or company is the correct recipient. Otherwise, blindly sending details of a security bug to the wrong person could create a risk. Before sharing specific details of the flaws, we asked the recipient of the “support” email address if this was the correct address to disclose a security exposure involving TeaOnHer user data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You must have us confused with ‘the Tea app’,” Lampkin replied by email. (We hadn’t.) “We don’t have a security breach or data leak,” he said. (It did.) “We have some bots at most but we haven’t scaled big enough to be in that conversation yet, sorry you were misinformed.” (We weren’t.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Satisfied that we had established contact with the correct person (albeit not with the response we received), TechCrunch shared details of the security flaws, as well as several links to exposed driver’s licenses, and a copy of Lampkin’s own data to underscore the severity of the security issues.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Thank you for this information. This is very concerning. We are going to jump on this right now,” said Lampkin.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite several follow-up emails, we have not heard from Lampkin since we disclosed the security flaws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It doesn’t matter if you’re a one-person software shop or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/jack-dorsey-says-his-secure-new-bitchat-app-has-not-been-tested-for-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a billionaire vibe coding through a weekend</a>: Developers still have a responsibility to keep their users’ data safe.

But there is no evidence that the App Store favors OpenAI over other AI companies — indeed, AI apps like Perplexity and DeepSeek have topped the App Store charts over the last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In previous years, Apple would have likely ignored claims of chart manipulation. Today, however, the company faces regulatory pressure and new laws around the world to rein in its power in the app distribution market. Apple has also recently been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-just-scored-a-major-win-against-apple/\">taken to task</a> by a U.S. district judge in its case with Epic Games over not implementing policy changes as the court instructed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

It’s just that Spotify and I have grown up, but we haven’t grown together.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, I’ve been tempted to leave Spotify many times. I know that the company faces accusations of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/\">poor streaming payouts</a> for artists compared to its competitors, and I haven’t forgotten that it was Spotify that platformed Joe Rogan’s podcast, then exclusive to the platform, to spread <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/covid-misinformation-joe-rogan-spotify-petition-1282240/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">misinformation</a> about COVID-19 and other viruses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I know that Spotify is trying to <a href=\"https://x.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1534556884384063490\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">kill the RSS feed</a>, a move that <a href=\"https://techwontsave.us/episode/204_how_spotify_tried_to_take_over_podcasting_w_eric_silver\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">siphons independence</a> from podcasters. And yet, I’m embarrassed to say that until recently, these issues didn’t move me enough to take the time and energy to investigate alternatives to Spotify, a platform that I’ve been using daily since high school.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unfortunately easy for us to bury our heads in the sand when the tech companies we pay monthly do things that disappoint us. (Yes, I still remember when Netflix<span> </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/netflix-layoffs-tudum-editorial/\">laid off my industry colleagues</a>, but I also know I’ll end up watching the new season of “Love Is Blind.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We don’t feel like our one subscription makes a difference — after all, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/the-backlash-against-duolingo-going-ai-first-didnt-even-matter/\">Duolingo</a> still beat revenue estimates after sparking a backlash when it said it would replace contractors with AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Spotify finally got to me in a way that’s unavoidable: When I open the app, I cannot bear its all-encompassing, suffocating reliance on algorithmic recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s an overwhelming display of visual clutter from the time it takes to navigate from Spotify’s home page to the music you’re looking for. These suggestions are front and center when you open the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, I may see an unsolicited, full-screen pop-up promoting a new podcast. Then I’m greeted with a 2-by-4 grid of music and podcast suggestions, including new episodes of shows I listened to once because they had a guest I liked, plus some other albums that I’ve dabbled in briefly over the last month or so. Below that, there’s a sponsored recommendation for a song I might like by an artist that I have never heard of. When I navigate to the search tab, I’m prompted with an audiobook recommendation, and if I scroll a little bit, I see vertical video clips that look like they belong on TikTok.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s easy to fall into Spotify’s recommendations, as the app constantly pelts you with customized playlists that its AI has curated specifically for you. On Spotify, you never have to make any decisions — and for some listeners, maybe that’s the point. But I noticed that I stopped listening to the music I actually wanted to listen to, and instead, I embraced the music that Spotify told me I wanted to listen to. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Without realizing it, I gave up my agency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t to say that my moral qualms with Spotify didn’t influence my choice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a January <a href=\"https://report.duetti.co/#1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report</a> from the music financing platform Duetti, Spotify, a company worth about $140 billion, pays about $3 per 1,000 streams. Amazon Music, Apple Music, and YouTube paid $8.80, $6.20, and $4.80, respectively, per 1,000 streams in 2024. (Spotify <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/spotify-says-it-paid-10-billion-to-music-industry-last-year/\">previously disputed the accuracy</a> of these figures.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify further alienated a portion of its audience in June, when CEO Daniel Ek announced that his investment firm led a nearly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/spotifys-daniel-ek-just-bet-bigger-on-helsing-europes-defense-tech-darling/\">$700 million funding round</a> for a company making AI-enabled military weapons. Some bands like <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/deerhoof-to-remove-music-from-spotify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Deerhoof</a>, <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/xiu-xiu-to-pull-music-from-spotify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Xiu Xiu</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2025/08/11/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-spotify-protest-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard</a> pulled their catalogs from Spotify in protest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s like déjà vu. In 2022, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young pulled their music from Spotify over Joe Rogan’s platforming of medical misinformation. (The two artists returned to the platform in 2024.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps it’s taken me so long to leave Spotify because choosing a streaming platform leaves you between a rock and a hard place. But if you’re attached to your years of playlists, tools like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/14/these-two-friends-built-a-simple-tool-to-transfer-playlists-between-apple-music-and-spotify-and-it-works-great/\">Soundiiz</a> make it easy to port your collection between platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I chose Apple Music, mostly because I got a new iPhone and it came with a three-month free trial, which helped me ease my transition. Also, Apple Music has lossless audio, which Spotify has been <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/audio/spotify/spotify-hi-fi-release-date-rumors-price-predictions-and-more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">promising for nearly five years</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But I cannot tell you with a straight face that I have departed big, bad Spotify to support the little guy, when I’ve opted for another tech giant. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I have my ethical concerns around Apple, too — even as I type this on my Magic Keyboard that’s connected to my MacBook Pro while my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch sit on the other side of my desk. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently showed up at the White House to gift Donald Trump with a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/07/trump-tim-cook-gift-white-house-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">custom, Apple-branded plaque,</a> which sits atop a 24-karat gold base, while performing his fiduciary duty to shareholders to keep Apple products tariff-free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At least the Apple Music app isn’t as overwhelming as Spotify. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

You can’t innovate in circuit design. It’s too mature.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Israel-based NeoLogic nevertheless set out to prove them wrong, and the fabless semiconductor startup has been building a server CPU that uses more simplified logic — how a chip processes information — with fewer transistors and logic gates to run faster while requiring less power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NeoLogic was founded in 2021 by Messica, CEO, and Leshem, CTO, who together have 50 years of experience in the semiconductor industry. Leshem spent decades working on chip design at companies like Intel and Synopsis, while Messica focused on circuit design and the manufacturing side.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We co-founded this company more than four years ago because Moore’s law was dead,” Messica said, referring to the 1960s observation that the number of transistors on microchips doubles every two years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around a decade ago, Messica said, companies stopped trying to scale transistors down in size, because transistors had gotten so small, there wasn’t much more progress to be made there. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But, he says, NeoLogic wasn’t convinced. The startup is working with two hyperscaler partners on the design of the server CPUs, but Messica would not disclose their names. The company plans to have a single-core test chip by the end of the year and hopes to get its server CPUs into data centers by 2027.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NeoLogic recently raised a $10 million Series A round led by KOMPAS VC with participation from M Ventures, Maniv Mobility, and lool Ventures. The company will use the funds to expand its engineering team and continue developing its CPUs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding round comes as data centers are straining existing energy resources with no relief in sight. The ongoing AI boom has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/data-center-power-demand-will-double-over-the-next-five-years/\">data center power usage expected to double</a> in just the next four years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Messica hopes that NeoLogic’s energy-saving potential will help make its server CPUs too attractive for the market to ignore.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It affects everything,” Messica said of the potential energy savings. “If you talk about next-generation data centers, it affects the construction costs; it affects the amount of capital that you’ll invest because you can shave off roughly 30% of the cost. And it affects the water usage. It has an impact on society, and basically that was our vision roughly five years ago.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/openai-cancels-its-o3-ai-model-in-favor-of-a-unified-next-gen-release/\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1955438916645130740\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on X </a>Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5’s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside GPT-5’s new modes, Altman said that paid users can once again access several legacy AI models — including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3 — which were deprecated just last week. GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT’s settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036523\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png 2214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1200,508 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1280,542 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=430,182 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=720,305 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=900,381 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=800,339 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1536,651 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=2048,868 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=668,283 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=1440,610 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=708,300 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-12-at-8.27.16PM.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">ChatGPT’s model picker now features several options.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>openai/maxwell zeff</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5’s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5’s rollout has been rougher than expected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/gpt-5-panned-on-reddit-sam-altman-ama?test_uuid=003aGE6xTMbhuvdzpnH5X4Q&amp;test_variant=b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">backlash among users</a> who had grown attached to the AI models’ responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT-5’s model router also appeared to be largely broken on launch day. That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn’t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/\">AMA session on Reddit</a>. However, it seems that GPT-5’s router may still not be satisfying for all users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a <a href=\"https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1955441658050515144\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on X</a> Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Routing prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user’s preferences, as well as the specific question they’re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast-responding AI model, the response can still be fast.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Human attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn’t well understood. For example, hundreds of people in San Francisco recently <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/claude-3-sonnet-funeral-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">held a funeral</a> for Anthropic’s AI model, Claude 3 Sonnet, when it was taken offline. In other cases, AI chatbots seem to be contributing to people struggling with mental health issues going down <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html\">unhealthy rabbit holes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems OpenAI has more work to do around aligning its AI models to individual user preferences. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Merge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-launches-neuralink-to-connect-brains-with-computers-1490642652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">known until 2017</a>) and the company has made serious progress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neuralink is <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/updates/gb-prime-study-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">currently in trials</a> with people who suffer from severe paralysis. It aims to allow them to control devices with their thoughts. It <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/updates/neuralink-raises-650m-series-e/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised a $600 million Series E at a $9 billion</a> valuation in June.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neuralink (and perhaps, Merge Labs) could revolutionize how humans interact with technology. Some might even say their tech could take humanity toward “the singularity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long before Silicon Valley became obsessed with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it was enamored with “the singularity.” Musk has used <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893810875875889507?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the term</a> to describe a time when AI surpasses human intelligence. The more classic definition (after a 1960’s novella of the same name by Dino Buzzati) means the merging of tech with humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman <a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blogged </a>about “The Merge” in 2017. “Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants,” he postulated at the time, citing research work he saw at OpenAI, where Musk was still a co-founder.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and the relationship between the two tech leaders has since disintegrated.
