Sure, why not! AI was everywhere at this year’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/ces-2026-everything-revealed-from-nvidias-debuts-to-amds-new-chips-to-razers-ai-oddities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES) in Las Vegas, where companies large and small were showing off how they’re bringing AI to more devices. For Amazon, CES was a time to show off its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/amazon-acquires-bee-the-ai-wearable-that-records-everything-you-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">newest acquisition in the space: Bee</a>, an AI device that can be worn as a clip-on pin or a bracelet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon already has an entry in the AI consumer devices space with Alexa, whose upgraded AI-powered version, Alexa+, can run on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/amazon-says-97-of-its-devices-can-support-alexa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">97% of the hardware devices Amazon has shipped</a>. However, with <a href=\"https://www.bee.computer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bee</a>, the company is gaining access to a wearable that could extend its reach outside the home.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Largely designed for recording conversations like interviews, meetings, or classes, Bee also works as an AI companion. The AI has access to world knowledge, and it learns more about you from a combination of your recordings and the services you permit it to access like Gmail, Google Calendar, your phone’s contacts, and Apple Health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that Amazon has already tried integrating Alexa into wearables like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/amazons-alexa-earbuds-return-with-a-smaller-design-and-wireless-charging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earbuds</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/23/amazons-new-echo-frames-cant-touch-the-ray-ban-meta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">glasses</a>, it could seem like the company is muddying the waters with the addition of another AI companion. However, those earlier Alexa devices have not taken off in the face of competition like Apple’s AirPods and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Amazon seems to understand this, which is why it’s adding Bee to its lineup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We see each other as complementary friends,” says Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo of Bee’s relationship with Alexa, in an interview at CES last week. “Bee has the understanding of outside the house, and Alexa has the understanding of inside the house. Of course, there will be a future where these two things come together.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That future doesn’t yet mean Bee’s AI will be replaced by Alexa. Noted Amazon Alexa VP Daniel Rausch, Amazon thinks what the team at Bee created is an “important and lovable experience.” He describes Bee as a “deeply engaging and personal” AI, but he also agreed that, at some point, Alexa and Bee would come together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know that it will create even more benefit for customers than what [the AI experiences] do on their own,” Rausch explained. “When you have access to the power of these AI experiences with you throughout the day, and they’re continuous — we’re gonna be able to do so much more for customers.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">De Lourdes Zollo said that Bee learns from its users, gaining an understanding of their patterns, insights, and commitments, which can help it to suggest to-do items and follow-ups throughout your day. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early use cases have included students who record lectures, elderly people who have trouble remembering things, and people who speak for a living and don’t want to always take notes manually. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They just want a place to have all the summarization of everything they said,” Bee’s co-founder said. “So based on that, we build a really big graph of knowledge [about] you, where you can go chat with Bee, and have an understanding of what happened to you, but also how you’re changing during the course of your life,” de Lourdes Zollo added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to Alexa, Bee uses a combination of AI models under the hood, but it’s exploring adding Amazon’s AI as one in the mix. After transcribing the conversation, Bee discards the audio, making it impractical for many work-related use cases where you need to play back the conversation to ensure accuracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s still much ahead for Bee in 2026, de Lourdes Zollo teased, without giving anything away. In addition to recent announcements of <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/bee-amazon-wearable-ai-device-new-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new features and functionality</a> — like voice notes, templates, daily insights, and more — the founder said the eight-person team is working on “many new things” out of their HQ in San Francisco, where Amazon already has a large number of hardware and Alexa employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Honestly, it’s endless possibilities now, and that’s one of the reasons why we’re really excited to be part of Amazon,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DTa3-B1EbTp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> the launch of Meta Compute, a new initiative designed to bolster the tech giant’s AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg said the company intended to drastically expand its energy footprint in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Meta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time. How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,” Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For reference, a gigawatt is a measurement of electrical power equivalent to a billion watts. The energy-hungry AI business means that America’s electrical consumption could spike exponentially over the next decade (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/energy/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/081325-artificial-intelligence-power-demand-in-us-could-top-50-gw-by-2030-epri\">from 5 GW to 50</a>, according to one estimate).   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerberg has named three executives that he says will be spearheading the new project. One of those people is Santosh Janardhan, the company’s head of global infrastructure. Janardhan, who has <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjanardhan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">been with the company since 2009</a>, will lead work on “technical architecture, software stack, silicon program, developer productivity, and building and operating our global datacenter fleet and network,” Zuckerberg said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also involved is Daniel Gross, who joined the company just last year. Gross is the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/19/meta-tried-to-buy-safe-superintelligence-hired-ceo-daniel-gross.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">co-founder of Safe Superintelligence</a>, along with former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Zuckerberg said that Gross would be leading a new group within Meta that is “responsible for long-term capacity strategy, supplier partnerships, industry analysis, planning, and business modeling.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, Zuckerberg said that Dina Powell McCormick, a former government official who <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/dina-powell-mccormick-joins-meta-president-vice-chairman-2026-01-12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently joined Meta</a> as the company’s president and vice chairman, would be responsible for working with governments to help “build, deploy, invest in, and finance Meta’s infrastructure.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s obviously a race to build out generative AI-ready cloud environments, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/apple-isnt-playing-the-same-ai-capex-game-as-the-rest-of-the-megacaps.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Capex projections</a> announced last year showed most of Meta’s peers had similar ambitions. Microsoft has been busy <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/03/lambda-ai-microsoft-nvidia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnering with AI infrastructure providers</a> wherever it can, and in December, Google parent company Alphabet announced the acquisition of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/alphabet-to-buy-intersect-power-to-bypass-energy-grid-bottlenecks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">data center firm Intersect</a>. TechCrunch reached out to Meta for more information about the new initiative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But Anthropic’s product promises more sophistication than ChatGPT Health, which seems as though it will be more focused on a patient-side chat experience as it rolls out gradually.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though some industry professionals are concerned about the role of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/psa-you-shouldnt-upload-your-medical-images-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hallucination-prone LLMs</a> in offering clients medical advice, Anthropic’s “<a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">agent skills</a>” seem promising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Claude has added what it calls “connectors” to give the AI access to platforms and databases that can speed up research processes and report generation for payers and providers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database; the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); the National Provider Identifier Standard; and PubMed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic explained in a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/healthcare-life-sciences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> that Claude for Health could use its connectors to speed up prior authorization review, the process in which a doctor must submit additional information to an insurance provider to see if it will cover a medication or treatment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Clinicians often report spending more time on documentation and paperwork than actually seeing patients,” Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said in a presentation about the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For doctors, submitting prior authorization documents is more of an administrative task than something that requires their specialized training and expertise. It’s something that makes more sense to automate than the actual process of administering medical advice … though Claude will do that as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People are already relying on LLMs for medical advice. OpenAI said that 230 million people talk about their health with ChatGPT each week, and there’s no doubt that Anthropic is observing that use case as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, both Anthropic and OpenAI warn consumers that they should see healthcare professionals for more reliable, tailored guidance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But this is not a new idea,” Migicovsky said, referring to the smartwatch reboot. “This is an old idea. We’re just bringing it back.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pebble founder said he’s learned a lot from his earlier efforts at building a hardware device maker, including what not to do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble, the original company that Migicovsky started, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/fitbit-pebble/\">was sold to Fitbit in 2016</a> for around $40 million; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/google-is-acquiring-fitbit/\">Fitbit was later acquired by Google</a> for $2.1 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just before its exit, Migicovsky’s team had been scrambling. Christmas 2015 had put Pebble into a tailspin, as the company had bought too much inventory.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Hardware is different from software. You have to predict ahead of time how much you’re going to sell, because you need to build the hardware,” Migicovsky explained, reminiscing on the time when things went wrong. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble’s team then had estimated they would do $102 million in sales that year, but they did “only” $82 million. While that number is impressive for a smartwatch brand (particularly one that’s not Apple, Google, or Samsung), the company was left with unsold inventory that had to be sold at a discount.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Retail partners were also upset because discounted sales meant reduced margins. Meanwhile, Pebble didn’t have enough money to finish developing its new products. To make ends meet, the company had to do rapid layoffs and reorganize. And ultimately, it had to find an exit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think I lost sight of the vision of why I was building Pebble,” Migicovsky admitted. “At the beginning, it was very clear. We had a Kickstarter. We posted on the web: here’s exactly what Pebble does, here’s what the features are, here’s who should be interested in it. And then we kind of meandered a bit. We tried to do health tracking.

The new Pebble smartwatches aren’t meant to be for everyone, he says. They’re meant to be for people like himself: a self-described “bit of a nerd,” who just likes hacking, building, and creating things. Nor are they for fitness junkies or those who want a smartphone on their wrist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I want a companion to my phone, rather than a replacement for my phone. I want it to be more like a Swatch than a Rolex. I want it to be a little bit more fun, casual, playful, and plasticky.” Plus, he added, with the reboot of Pebble, he’s now okay with a watch that doesn’t try to do it all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m okay with a limited vision and a limited scope of what we’re trying to accomplish,” Migicovsky said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the new company, Core Devices, the team has announced the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/pebbles-smartwatch-is-back-pebble-time-2-specs-revealed/\">Pebble Time 2 smartwatch</a>, a round-faced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/pebble-reboots-its-thinnest-smartwatch-with-the-pebble-round-2/\">Pebble Round 2</a>, and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/\">$75 AI smart ring, called the Index 01</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the company today is not going to be a large team of 180 employees as before, or one that works with distributors. Instead, there are only five people, and it sells directly to consumers on its website.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081857\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg 2386w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=1280,719 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=430,241 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=720,404 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=900,505 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=800,449 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1150 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=1099,617 1099w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-11.18.25-AM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pebbleos-core.readthedocs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">PebbleOS documentation website <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The foundation, however, remains PebbleOS, the smartwatch’s operating system, which was thankfully open sourced by Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky recalls that he ran into a Google employee, Matthieu Jeanson, at a kid’s birthday party, where he got the contact information for someone who might be able to make a call about open sourcing the smartwatch’s operating system. He sent the email requesting that Google make the OS open source, and a year later, it followed through.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I really am thankful to Google, because what other big company in the world would do that?” said Migicovsky. “I think they did it as an homage to the Pebble community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Without PebbleOS, the rebooted Pebble smartwatch would have been an impossibility, as it took a team of 30 to 40 people working for years to build it originally. Recreating that from scratch wasn’t an option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, the new company’s structure is working. The company has sold 25,000 preorders for its smartwatches, and around 5,000 for its AI ring, which is newer.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081850\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=1200,629 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=1280,671 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=720,378 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=900,472 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=800,420 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=1536,805 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=668,350 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=1177,617 1177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=708,371 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Black-hero-updated_small.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Pebble</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pebble preorders are currently shipping about six months out, but Migicovsky said that the team will tighten that down to a couple of weeks. In addition, the Pebble App Store features 15,000 watch faces and apps. In a few weeks, the team will also be relaunching the SDK for developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Migicovsky says the team is in a “comfortable spot,” where their expenses are paid, and they’re able to finance new projects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s right — the team is not done yet. Migicovsky won’t detail what sort of hardware devices Core Devices may ship next, but says they’ll be the sort of things he personally wants to have.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are a lot of products that are already on the market. Nothing that we’re making is like something that already exists,” Migicovsky hints. “[The next products will be] fun, casual, simple hardware, and they’re things that will kind of make my life a little bit better, one block at a time. And they’re going to work together.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Built into the Claude Desktop app, the new tool lets users designate a specific folder where Claude can read or modify files, with further instructions given through the standard chat interface. The result is similar to a sandboxed instance of Claude Code, but requires far less technical savvy to set up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Currently in research preview</a>, Cowork is only available to Max subscribers, with a waitlist available for users on other plans.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new tool is inspired in part by <a href=\"https://everything.intellectronica.net/p/claude-code-for-non-coders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the growing number of subscribers</a> using Claude Code to achieve non-coding tasks, treating it as a general-purpose agentic AI tool. Cowork is built on the Claude Agent SDK, which means it’s drawing on the same underlying model as Claude Code. The folder partition gives an easy way to manage what files Cowork has access to, and because the app doesn’t require command-line tools or virtual environments, it’s less intimidating for non-technical users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That opens up a new world of potential use cases. Anthropic gives the example of assembling an expense report from a folder of receipt photos — but Claude Code users have also <a href=\"https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/everyone-should-be-using-claude-code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">put the system to work</a> managing media files, scanning social media posts, or analyzing conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar to Claude Code, Cowork is designed to take strings of actions without user input — a potentially dangerous approach if the tool is given vague or contradictory instructions. In a blog post announcing the new tool, Anthropic explicitly warns about the risk of prompt injection or deleted files, recommending that users make instructions as clear and unambiguous as possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These risks aren’t new with Cowork,” the post reads, “but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched as a command-line tool in November 2024, Claude Code has become one of Anthropic’s most successful products, leading the company to launch a string of new interfaces in recent months. A web interface launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/anthropic-brings-claude-code-to-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in October</a>, followed by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/claude-code-is-coming-to-slack-and-thats-a-bigger-deal-than-it-sounds/\">a Slack integration</a> just two months later.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If you think too long about it, it’s a bit crass, but the upshot was to provide some cost-benefit analysis of pollution controls. Lowering pollution can prolong human life, so if the health benefits of reducing pollution outweighed the costs, then there was an economic argument to be made in favor of those reductions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every administration since has assigned some value to human life when determining how to regulate air pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration is planning to throw decades of accepted practice out the window, according to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/climate/trump-epa-air-pollution.html\">report</a> in the New York Times. If the EPA follows through on its plans, then it would no longer count the value of human health when regulating ozone and fine particulate matter pollution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The risks of air pollution have been known for decades, which was part of the reason the EPA was founded under President Richard Nixon in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ozone and fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, have long been linked to cardiovascular ailments like <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/advance/health-effects-ozone-and-particulate-matter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asthma, heart disease, and emphysema</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ozone high in the atmosphere protects us against UV radiation. But when it forms close to the ground, as happens when oxides of nitrogen are emitted by everything from cars to power plants, it can create smog. On particularly smoggy days, it can be deadly to vulnerable populations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PM2.5 might be even more pernicious. Recent research has connected PM2.5 to a broader range of illnesses, including <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Parkinson’s</a>, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">kidney disease</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30227-8/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Alzheimer’s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02844-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dementia</a>, and <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">type 2 diabetes</a>. Even the tiniest, youngest infants aren’t spared, since a mother’s exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">low birth weight</a>. Worldwide, as many as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">10 million people</a> per year die from fine particulate matter pollution annually.

Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, used <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/xai-is-facing-a-lawsuit-for-operating-over-400-mw-of-gas-turbines-without-permits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dozens of unpermitted natural gas turbines</a> to power its Colossus data center near Memphis, Tennessee, a region the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America said was already an “asthma capital” due to pollution from transportation and industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is welcoming the Trump administration’s policy change. “We appreciate the efforts of this administration to rebalance regulations with a common-sense approach. We look forward to examining the proposal from E.P.A,” Marty Durbin, president of the chamber’s Global Energy Institute, told the New York Times.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company has been steadily rolling out access to the AI platform, with more than 1 million Alexa customers gaining access <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/over-a-million-people-now-have-access-to-the-gen-ai-powered-alexa/\">by last June</a>, and now, “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/alexa-without-an-echo-amazons-ai-chatbot-comes-to-the-web-and-a-revamped-alexa-app/\">tens of millions</a>” can opt in to upgrade to the AI assistant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon doesn’t have an exact date for when Alexa+ will be available to everyone; the company is focusing first on bringing the AI to all Prime members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What Amazon soon has to prove, beyond availability, is whether customers will actually use its AI. That’s where Rausch believes Alexa’s existing footprint will help. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that there’s going to be a whole range of AI out there for customers. I think that Alexa will be one of the foundational assistants,” he said. While he believes there will always be some specialist AIs on the market, like those that focus on one thing, like being a legal assistant, there will be a few “nameable, foundational AIs that are highly capable,” which is where Alexa slots in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think some of the advantages Alexa has is the familiarity of customers, the tens of millions of customers already engaging continuously,” Rausch said. “It’s in the home, ambiently available, in voice, in the most natural interface. I do believe that that’s our opportunity to grow,” he added.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa’s plans for the home come as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/googles-gemini-to-power-apples-ai-features-like-siri/\">Apple announced it’s teaming up with Google’s Gemini for Siri,</a> as other AI chatbots, like ChatGPT and Claude, compete across a variety of use cases ranging from research to healthcare to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/anthropic-brings-claude-code-to-the-web/\">coding</a> and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just ahead of CES, Amazon announced a way to access Alexa on the web and a redesigned Alexa app that puts a chatbot-style interface front and center. At the conference, Amazon partners like <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-plus-samsung-bmw-bosch-oura-integrations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Samsung, BMW, and Oura</a> showed off their Alexa integrations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also promoted its recent acquisition of Bee, an AI wearable that lets you record conversations and gain insights. Customers can engage with Bee via text or voice chat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the future, Rausch says Alexa and Bee will become more integrated. But, he added, Bee has value as its own standalone brand, calling it a “an important and lovable experience.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This indicates significant growth, as Apple last reported that as of 2021, it had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-paid-out-around-60-billion-to-app-store-developers-in-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">paid out $260 billion to developers</a>, up from the $200 billion it reported in 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The App Store generally takes a 30% commission from in-app purchases, though it offers small businesses (developers making under $1 million annually) a reduced 15% fee.

Apple TV eclipsed all prior viewership records in December 2025, the company says, and Apple Music achieved record highs in listenership and new subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple TV’s growth comes alongside the debut of new hits like “Pluribus” and “The Studio,” as well as ongoing successes like “Severance.” Apple TV also struck major streaming deals with Major League Soccer and Formula 1. “F1,” Apple TV’s movie about the sport, became Apple Studios’ highest-grossing film yet, as well as the highest-grossing film of star Brad Pitt’s career.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple credits its karaoke-like “Sing” feature, partnerships with companies like GM and Chase, and other new developments for its growth. It notes that Shazam generated over 1 billion recognitions per month, which could have funneled growth into its Music service. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s also possible that Apple benefited from controversy around Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s business ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ek’s investment firm led a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/spotifys-daniel-ek-just-bet-bigger-on-helsing-europes-defense-tech-darling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">€600 million investment</a> in European defense tech company Helsing, which makes AI-powered military software and <a href=\"https://helsing.ai/hx-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">strike drones</a>. Artists like Xiu Xiu, Sylvan Esso, King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof, and others removed their catalogs from Spotify in protest.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify has faced other controversies over the last several years, from its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/joe-rogan-alex-jones-and-spotifys-illusion-of-neutrality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">platforming</a> of COVID-19 misinformation via Joe Rogan’s podcast (formerly a Spotify <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">exclusive</a>) to its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/spotify-says-its-payouts-are-getting-better-but-artists-still-disagree/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">artist payout</a> metrics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the other hand, Apple Music could be growing because it’s simply making a product that is better suited for some listeners (I wrote about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/why-i-finally-left-spotify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my decision</a> to switch from Spotify to Apple Music as I became increasingly suffocated by algorithmic recommendations).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It could also be a financial decision amid uncertain economic times — Apple Music lures new subscribers with its three-month free offer, which comes alongside the purchase of most new Apple devices.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Apple has chosen to work with Google, a longtime partner, to power AI features like Siri. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” Apple and Google said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership confirms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/apple-is-in-talks-to-use-googles-gemini-for-siri-revamp-report-says/\">previous reporting</a> on a deal with Google. Neither Apple nor Google have confirmed the price tag, but previous reports indicate Apple could be paying Google around <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/apple-nears-deal-to-pay-google-1b-annually-to-power-new-siri-report-says/\">$1 billion</a> for access to its AI technology. The deal also comes after Apple spent some time testing the technology of competitors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/heres-how-chatgpt-integration-works-for-apple-intelligence/\">like OpenAI </a>and Anthropic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The multi-year partnership will involve Apple using Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models. The deal is not exclusive, per a source familiar with the matter. Apple has historically focused on vertical integration, relying on its own hardware and software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone-maker has faced a fair amount of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/apple-just-named-a-new-ai-chief-with-google-and-microsoft-expertise-as-john-giannandrea-steps-down/\">public chatter criticizing</a> it after its AI efforts, particularly its assistant Siri, lagged behind competitors. That’s not to say Apple hasn’t been quietly building powerful foundational models. The company released the first versions of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/apple-intelligence-everything-you-need-to-know-about-apples-ai-model-and-services/\">Apple Intelligence</a> in 2024, which adds AI to existing OS functions like searching for photos and summarizing notifications. Apple has also focused on privacy with its AI rollout, with much of the processing happening on-device or through tightly controlled infrastructure. Apple says it will maintain those privacy standards throughout its partnership with Google. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s strategy has resulted in a subtle, sometimes invisible, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-are-honestly-pretty-bad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">occasionally resented</a> form of AI — one that doesn’t have the same wow factor as ChatGPT or Gemini. It also stops short of delivering the kind of Siri overhaul many users have been waiting for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/ai-powered-more-personalized-siri-is-delayed/\">delayed</a> the rollout of its “more personalized Siri” voice assistant several times, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch an upgrade is coming this year. Previous reports indicate the overhauled Siri is expected to launch in the spring. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s partnership with Google also comes as the search and adtech giant is in the midst of multiple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">antitrust lawsuits</a>, including one that put its relationship with Apple front and center.

Discovery (WBD) in Delaware, demanding greater financial disclosure regarding Netflix’s $82.7 billion acquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://www.paramount.com/press/paramount-provides-update-to-warner-bros-discovery-shareholders-on-actions-it-is-taking-to-advance-its-superior-30-per-share-all-cash-offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a letter to shareholders</a>, Ellison disclosed that the lawsuit has been filed in the Delaware Chancery Court, requesting that WBD provide essential information that it allegedly has failed to share. Ellison argues that shareholders need accurate information to assess whether to accept Paramount’s competing offer of $30 per share in cash, which he claims is superior to Netflix’s deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellison wrote, “WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Along with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation … WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its ‘risk adjustment’ of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer,” Ellison added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, WBD’s board <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rejected Paramount’s latest bid</a> once again, saying there’s too much risk of the deal falling through.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Trump also expressed his dissatisfaction with the merger. Over the weekend, Trump shared on <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115877170851219343\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Truth Social</a> an opinion piece by John Pierce titled “Stop the Netflix Cultural Takeover,” published in <a href=\"https://www.oann.com/commentary/stop-the-netflix-cultural-takeover/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">One America News</a> last month. Pierce believes if Netflix acquires Warner Bros.’ streaming and studio assets, it would establish itself as “the most dominant cultural gatekeeper the United States — and much of the world — has ever seen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After meeting with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in December, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-says-netflix-warner-bros-deal-problem-will-involved-approval-rcna247923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">indicated</a> that the merger “could be a problem,” due to Netflix’s already significant market share, which would expand greatly with the acquisition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry has also generally reacted negatively to the acquisition, raising concerns about job implications, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix co-CEOs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\">Greg Peters and Sarandos</a> attempted to address these fears in a letter last month. However, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) continues to oppose the acquisition, citing antitrust law violations. Lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal, warn that the merger could lead to increased consumer costs, exacerbating financial pressures on middle-class families, especially following Netflix’s recent price hike. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The app has been taken down from the two major app stores and it’s banned from most social platforms, but it’s still available on the web and through a Telegram bot. In October, a clinic at Yale Law School filed a lawsuit that would take down the app entirely, forcing the owners to delete all images and cease operation entirely. But simply finding the defendants has been a challenge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s incorporated in the British Virgin Islands,” explains Professor John Langford, a co-lead counsel in the lawsuit, “but we believe it’s run by a brother and sister in Belarus. It may even be part of a larger network around the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a bitter lesson in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/x-restricts-groks-image-generation-to-paying-subscribers-only-after-drawing-the-worlds-ire/\">the recent flood of non-consensual pornography</a> generated by Elon Musk’s xAI, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">included many underage victims</a>. Child sexual abuse material is the most legally toxic content on the internet — illegal to produce, transmit, or store, and regularly scanned for on every major cloud service. But despite the intense legal prohibitions, there are still few ways to deal with image generators like ClothOff, as Langford’s case demonstrates. Individual users can be prosecuted, but platforms like ClothOff and Grok are far more difficult to police, leaving few options for victims hoping to find justice in court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The clinic’s complaint, which is <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.585002/gov.uscourts.njd.585002.1.0.pdf?utm_campaign=149-the-irs-has-a-sidewalk-problem&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.courtwatch.news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">available online</a>, paints an alarming picture. The plaintiff is an anonymous high school student in New Jersey, whose classmates used ClothOff to alter her Instagram photos. She was 14 years old when the original Instagram photos were taken, which means the AI-modified versions are legally classified as child abuse imagery. But even though the modified images are straightforwardly illegal, local authorities declined to prosecute the case, citing the difficulty of obtaining evidence from suspects’ devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Neither the school nor law enforcement ever established how broadly the CSAM of Jane Doe and other girls was distributed,” the complaint reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the court case has moved slowly. The complaint was filed in October, and in the months since, Langford and his colleagues have been in the process of serving notice to the defendants — a difficult task given the global nature of the enterprise. Once they’ve been served, the clinic can push for a court appearance and, eventually, a judgment, but in the meantime the legal system has given little comfort to ClothOff’s victims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Grok case might seem like a simpler problem to fix. Elon Musk’s xAI isn’t hiding, and there’s plenty of money at the end for lawyers who can win a claim. But Grok is a general-purpose tool, which makes it much harder to hold it accountable in court.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“ClothOff is designed and marketed specifically as a deepfake pornography image and video generator,” Langford told me. “When you’re suing a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it gets a lot more complicated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A number of U.S. laws have already banned deepfake pornography — most notably <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAKE_IT_DOWN_Act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the Take It Down Act</a>. But while specific users are clearly breaking those laws, it’s much harder to hold the entire platform accountable. Existing laws require clear evidence of an intent to harm, which would mean providing evidence xAI knew their tool would be used to produce non-consensual pornography. Without that evidence, xAI’s basic first amendment rights would provide significant legal protection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In terms of the First Amendment, it’s quite clear Child Sexual Abuse material is not protected expression,” Langford says. “So when you’re designing a system to create that kind of content, you’re clearly operating outside of what’s protected by the First Amendment. But when you’re a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it’s not so clear.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The easiest way to surmount those problems would be to show that xAI had willfully ignored the problem. It’s a real possibility, given <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/tech/elon-musk-xai-digital-undressing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recent reporting</a> that Musk directed employees to loosen Grok’s safeguards. But even then, it would be a far riskier case to take on.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Reasonable people can say, we knew this was a problem years ago,” Langford says. “How can you not have had more stringent controls in place to make sure this doesn’t happen? That is a kind of recklessness or knowledge but it’s just a more complicated case.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those First Amendment issues are why xAI’s biggest pushback has come from court systems without robust legal protections for free speech. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">Both Indonesia and Malaysia</a> have taken steps to block access to the Grok chatbot, while regulators in the United Kingdom have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy875j28k0o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">opened an investigation</a> that could lead to a similar ban. <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/tracking-regulator-responses-to-the-grok-undressing-controversy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Other preliminary steps</a> have been taken by the European Commission, France, Ireland, India, and Brazil. In contrast, no U.S. regulatory agency has issued an official response.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s impossible to say how the investigations will resolve, but at the very least, the flood of imagery raises lots of questions for regulators to investigate — and the answers could be damning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you are posting, distributing, disseminating Child Sexual Abuse material, you are violating criminal prohibitions and can be held accountable,” Langford says. “The hard question is, what did X know? What did X do or not do? What are they doing now in response to it?“</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deals have to be approved by the bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of Texas before they are finalized. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell has signaled interest in submitting a bid for the lidar assets and tried to buy the whole company in October, before it filed for bankruptcy. The company is currently trying to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/luminar-claims-founder-austin-russell-is-dodging-a-subpoena-in-the-bankruptcy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">serve him with a subpoena</a> for information stored on his cell phone, as Luminar evaluates whether it wants to make any legal claims against him related to the board-run ethics inquiry that led to his resignation last May. It’s not known how many other bids Luminar might receive by Monday’s deadline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quantum Computing Inc. has been designated as a “stalking horse bidder,” which helps establish a baseline for the value of the assets and helps prevent low-ball bids. Luminar has said it wants to move through the bankruptcy case quickly, as its largest creditors — mostly financial institutions that loaned the company money over the last few years — are helping fund the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Luminar receives a higher offer, the stalking horse bid represents a monumental fall from the company’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/11/26/will-luminar-stock-continue-to-decline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">peak market cap</a> in 2021, when it was worth around $11 billion. That valuation was propped up by the promise that Luminar’s lidar sensors were going to become widely adopted by major automakers like Volvo, which at one point planned to buy more than 1 million of them before ultimately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">walking away from the deal in 2025</a>. Other deals with Mercedes-Benz and Polestar fell apart along the way, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quantum Computing Inc. was founded in 2001 as a company called Ticketcart that sold ink-jet cartridges, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000121390021016296/f10k2020_quantumcomputing.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to its filings</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It bought a beverage company in 2007, went through its own restructuring process 10 years later, and pivoted to making optic technology for the budding world of quantum computing. The company raised more than $700 million <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000121390025110814/ea0264309-10q_quantum.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">by selling shares in 2025</a>, though its revenue for the first nine months of last year was just $384,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Founded in 2024, the company is now <a href=\"https://www.harmattan.ai/blog/harmattan-ai-200-million-series-b-led-by-dassault-aviation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">valued at $1.4 billion</a> after raising a $200 million Series B round led by Dassault Aviation, which is best known for making the Rafale fighter jet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harmattan AI, which builds autonomy and mission-system software for defense aircraft, had already received strong validation signals from the French and British ministries of defense in its less than two years of existence. But this funding and the accompanying partnership will give new wings to a company that once <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/harmattan-ai-seeks-200m-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described itself</a> as a “European Anduril.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like its American peer, Harmattan AI once aspired to overtake defense incumbents, which are also known as primes. But the company is now also ready to partner with them — even if it means no longer <a href=\"https://www.harmattan.ai/blog/harmattan-ai-awarded-program-of-record-one-year-after-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">calling itself</a> “a next-generation defense prime.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Harmattan’s latest press release, the now “defense technology company” will help Dassault Aviation shape the future of air combat by developing embedded AI capabilities for its next generations of Rafales and drones while making sure this implementation is both sovereign and scalable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The use of drones in Ukraine has been a wake-up call for NATO armies, creating tailwinds for defense tech startups that can help them adapt. According to Harmattan AI, which recently <a href=\"https://skyeton.com/news/skyeton-and-harmattan-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnered</a> with Ukrainian drone maker Skyeton, the funding will help it extend its product offering into new domains and scale manufacturing of its platforms for drone interception, electronic warfare, and ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">French president Emmanuel Macron praised the announcement <a href=\"https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2010618107476287767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on social media</a>, calling it “excellent news for our strategic autonomy, for the technological superiority of our armed forces in the field of AI-activated defense drones, as well as for our economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While important for France, this strategic play isn’t exclusive.

The continent is undergoing rapid industrialization, he told TechCrunch. There is money, opportunity, and a young, driven population. He figured, soon enough, the continent was on the “edge of an industrial revolution.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the same time,” he said, he felt the continent still struggled to address what was one of its biggest Achilles’ heels: “Terrorism and insecurity.” Africa <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8vyl3j5kko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has more terror-related deaths</a> than any region in the world, and it is this problem that could slow down — or even stop completely — the growth of the region, Nwachuku said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He teamed up with a friend, Maxwell Maduka, 24, and <a href=\"https://www.terraindustries.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Terra Industries,</a> a defense company that designs infrastructure and autonomous systems to help governments and organizations monitor and respond to threats. The company announced Monday that it emerged from stealth with an $11.75 million round led by Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in the round include Valor Equity Partners, Lux Capital, SV Angel, and Nova Global. The company previously raised an $800,000 pre-seed round, and Nwachuku said others took much interest in the company after it appeared on CNN. African investors in the company include Tofino Capital, Kaleo Ventures, and DFS Lab. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The goal is to build Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks,” Nwachuku, the company’s CEO, said. Maduka serves as the company’s CTO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team is stacked with military experience: 40% of its engineers held the same role in the Nigerian military; 8VC’s Alex Moore, who specializes in defense investing, is also on the board, and Nigeria’s Vice Air Marshal Ayo Jolasinmi serves as an advisor. Maduka also served as an engineer in the Nigerian Navy and founded a drone company at 19.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, based in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, took a multi-domain approach to product development, considering how to protect critical infrastructure from the ground, water, and air. For the air, the company produces long-range and short-range drones. On the ground, it has surveillance towers and ground drones. The company is still working on developing maritime technology to help protect infrastructure such as offshore rigs and underwater pipelines. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Terra powers its tech with its proprietary software, ArtemisOS, which collects, analyzes, and synthesizes data in real time. Once threats are spotted, they alert response forces (such as security agencies) so they can intercept them. “We want to geofence all of Africa’s critical infrastructure and resources,” Nwachuku said, adding that the problem is not lack of firepower (many African armies already have that).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, it’s a lack of sovereign intelligence, as much of the intelligence that African countries depend on comes from Western powers, China, and Russia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to take the defense of our continent’s resources and infrastructure into Africa’s own hands,” Nwachuku continued. “We are the first truly Pan-African defense company.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Terra recently won its first federal contract, though it said it cannot provide more details. The company makes money when governments and commercial customers place orders for Terra systems and then pay an annual fee for data processing and storage. Nwachuku said the company has generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue so far and is protecting assets valued at around $11 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commercial revenue comes from protecting private infrastructure, like gold mines or power plants. Terra said it is protecting at least two hydro power plants and several smaller mines, with most of the company’s clientele coming from Nigeria. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hopes to use the fresh capital to help expand and build more defense factories across Africa. It also wants to further expand its software capabilities and grow its AI team. It will open software offices in San Francisco and London, but the company said manufacturing will remain in Africa, with more factories opening across the continent to boost job creation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s clear Africa today is undergoing what I see as an epic struggle for its very survival,” Nwachuku said. “The only way for us to truly break ourselves from the shackles that have held us back for the last decade or two is ensuring the core resources, the core infrastructures of the continent, are entirely protected.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Advertising offers a high-margin revenue stream that scales with usage, while grocery delivery increases how frequently users open the app. The combination could help inDrive reduce reliance on ride commissions while reinforcing its core mobility business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">inDrive has built its position on affordability, using a peer-to-peer negotiation model that lets riders and drivers agree on fares directly rather than relying on fixed pricing. It nonetheless operates in a crowded market alongside global players such as Uber and local micro-commuting options including taxis and autorickshaws, prompting the company to look beyond rides alone. That backdrop shaped inDrive’s “super app” strategy, aimed at adding higher-frequency services such as grocery delivery in frontier and emerging markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advertising on inDrive is being rolled out across markets including Mexico, Colombia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Egypt, and Morocco. The rollout follows mid-2025 tests that delivered hundreds of millions of impressions and drew interest from global consumer brands and banks, said Andries Smit, inDrive’s chief growth business officer, in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The advertising business will initially focus on placements within the app, including during the waiting period after a ride is booked and while passengers are en route, moments that generate high engagement and sustained attention, Smit told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In-car and on-vehicle advertising are part of the longer-term roadmap. However, Smit said inDrive plans to prioritize in-app formats through 2026, citing operational complexity around on-car advertising in emerging markets and stronger early returns from digital placements.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pakistan-the-next-big-market-for-indrive-s-super-app-play\">Pakistan, the next big market for inDrive’s “super app” play</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The focus on in-app advertising dovetails with inDrive’s push into groceries, a higher-frequency use case where the company expects to generate stronger engagement and advertising demand than from rides alone. inDrive is scaling grocery delivery in Pakistan, its second market after Kazakhstan, through a partnership with local dark-store operator Krave Mart, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-27/ride-hailing-unicorn-indrive-invests-in-pakistan-s-grocery-startup-krave-mart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">received an investment</a> from inDrive in December 2024.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pakistan stands out, Smit said, because of a combination of rising demand for quick commerce and inDrive’s own scale in the market. Grocery retail remains highly fragmented and informal, while urban consumers are increasingly turning to app-based delivery as more households juggle work and family responsibilities. Simultaneously, inDrive has emerged as one of the country’s leading mobility platforms, giving it a large, engaged user base to cross-sell groceries without the high customer acquisition costs that have weighed on many quick-commerce startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching in 2021, inDrive has steadily expanded its footprint in Pakistan, with ride volumes rising nearly 40% year-over-year in 2025, while deliveries through its courier services grew 67% in the first half of the year, per company data shared with TechCrunch. The company views Pakistan as one of its fastest-growing markets globally, with particularly high usage in major cities such as Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. Overall, inDrive operates ride-hailing services in more than 20 Pakistani cities and intercity services across over 200 locations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">InDrive’s grocery rollout in Pakistan will begin in Karachi, the country’s largest city and one of the company’s strongest markets, where users will be able to order daily essentials through the app with delivery times of around 20 to 30 minutes. The service will then expand to other major cities, including Lahore, Islamabad, and Rawalpindi later this year as inDrive builds out supply and logistics with Krave Mart. The platform plans to offer more than 7,500 products — spanning fresh produce, meat and dairy, snacks, and household items — alongside free delivery on orders above PKR 499 (about $2) with no service fees.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>inDrive</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to its rapid growth as a ride-hailing market, Pakistan has also emerged as a focal point for inDrive’s capital deployment. Of the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/indrive-launches-ventures-and-ma-arm-to-invest-100m-in-startups-across-emerging-markets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$100 million multi-year investment program</a> announced in late 2023, Smit said the largest share so far has been directed toward Pakistan, though he declined to disclose specific figures. He added that at least half of the overall $100 million commitment has already been deployed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing incredible potential in Pakistan,” said Smit. “Ideally, we want to continue and double down on [investments] as we see performance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">inDrive’s growing focus on Pakistan comes despite broader investor caution toward the market. Venture capital and public investors have largely stayed on the sidelines amid geopolitical and macroeconomic risks, even as activity shows signs of recovery. Equity funding in Pakistan rose 63% YoY in 2025 to $36.6 million across 10 rounds, per a recent report by Karachi-based startup analyst firm Data Darbar — <a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40400887\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">well below the $347 million</a> and $331 million raised in 2021 and 2022, respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the gap between investor caution and on-the-ground demand is precisely where inDrive sees opportunity. Having operated across dozens of emerging markets, Smit said the company is more accustomed to volatility and less reliant on shifting capital-market sentiment, giving it confidence to invest where others hesitate. With an established local business and a large active user base, he noted that inDrive can also help partners scale without heavy spending on customer acquisition — an advantage that becomes especially valuable when external funding is scarce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">inDrive’s push into advertising and commerce is underpinned by scale. The company operates in 1,065 cities across 48 countries and has surpassed 360 million app downloads, making it the world’s second most-downloaded mobility app for the third consecutive year, behind Uber, per company data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, inDrive expects advertising to become a more meaningful contributor over the medium term, particularly as grocery and delivery volumes grow and create more opportunities for contextual promotions. Ride-hailing, which accounted for about 95% of inDrive’s revenue just a few years ago, now makes up closer to 85%, even as the core business continues to grow, reflecting how newer verticals are beginning to scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Groceries, delivery, advertising, and, eventually, financial services are expected to play a larger role over the next three to five years as the company expands selectively across priority markets, Smit said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/hyundai-is-spending-close-to-1-billion-to-keep-self-driving-startup-motional-alive/\">$1 billion investment</a> to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/motional-cut-about-550-employees-around-40-in-recent-restructuring-sources-say/\">40% restructuring cut</a> in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/motional-delays-commercial-robotaxi-plans-amid-restructuring/\">paused everything</a> and picked option No. 1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081790\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Kirsten Korosec</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is really critical for two things; one is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost-optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch got a firsthand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double-parked Amazon delivery van.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost-effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
