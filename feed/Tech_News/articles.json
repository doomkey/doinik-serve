Developers invest countless hours, months, or even years creating games just to surrender a significant portion—up to 30%—of their earnings to major players like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/y-combinator-says-apples-app-store-has-hindered-startup-growth/\">Apple</a> and Google. However, a newcomer has entered the scene, aiming to revolutionize this model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meet <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.jest.com/.\">Jest</a>, a marketplace for messaging games that recently emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding. Jest believes that the future of mobile gaming distribution won’t come from an app store, but rather from within the messaging app. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments. <br><br>With RCS adoption growing, the landscape is shifting. In 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/apple-finally-adds-support-for-rcs-in-latest-ios-18-beta/\">Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18</a>, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-announces-1b-rcs-messages-sent-in-the-u-s-daily/\">according to Google</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097049\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=430,229 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=720,383 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=900,479 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=800,425 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=668,355 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=1161,617 1161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=708,376 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jest</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This convenience is particularly impactful as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/app-downloads-declined-again-in-2025-but-consumer-spending-soared-to-nearly-156b/\">consumers are downloading fewer games</a>. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform had already achieved two significant milestones: more than 1 million messaging games played and over 300,000 messages exchanged. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing 3-4 times better retention than traditional mobile apps. That’s a fundamental shift in the engagement curve. On the user acquisition front, we’ve completely validated that people will sign up and play games through messaging, with our early partners reporting 30-60% lower acquisition costs compared to mobile apps. It’s remarkably simple. Just tap on a link, and you’re in,” Vitanov shared with us. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097048\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=680,546 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=430,345 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=720,578 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=900,723 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=800,643 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=668,537 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=467,375 467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=661,531 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jest</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, what’s most appealing about Jest’s marketplace is the revenue model for developers: an impressive 90/10 split, with 90% of earnings going directly to them. This stands in contrast to the typical 30% commission taken by traditional app stores, offering a promising new avenue for gaming studios.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s also a clever network effect built in. If one studio acquires a user but another studio monetizes them, we split the economics: 70% to the monetizing studio, 20% to the acquiring studio, and 10% to Jest. This creates powerful incentives where even viral games that don’t monetize well can generate revenue streams for their developers when those users play other games on the platform,” Vitanov added. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Jest has already attracted interest from several development partners, including teams behind popular titles such as “Episode,” “Puppy Mansion,” and “Kingdom Maker.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed funding, led by Innovation Endeavors, will go toward scaling the platform and onboarding the first group of gaming studios. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To further accelerate growth, Jest has also launched a dedicated Games Fund to support studios at every stage of franchise development on the platform.  This fund will deploy capital across three tiers: $1 million for flagship titles, $200,000 for promising mid-stage titles, and $40,000 for exploratory projects and experimental concepts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Jest is live in the U.S. and is set to expand to 14 additional countries by the third quarter of 2026.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move comes a week after the design company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/figma-anthropic-ai-code-designs.html\">struck</a> a similar partnership with Anthropic to integrate Claude Code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This integration lets users start working with a design in Figma or code in Codex, and move between the two platforms easily using Figma’s MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, users could bring details from Figma design files, Figma Make, or FigJam into Codex for code-based implementation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With this integration, teams can build on their best ideas—not just their first idea—by combining the best of code with the creativity, collaboration, and craft that comes with Figma’s infinite canvas,” Loredan Crisan, Figma’s chief design officer, said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The integration makes Codex powerful for a much broader range of builders and businesses because it doesn’t assume you’re ‘a designer’ or ‘an engineer’ first. Engineers can iterate visually without leaving their flow, and designers can work closer to real implementation without becoming full-time coders,” Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI first launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/\">Codex as a command-line coding assistant</a> last year to compete with Anthropic’s much lauded Claude Code. Later, the company built <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/openai-launches-codex-an-ai-coding-agent-in-chatgpt/\">the coding tool into ChatGPT</a>, and earlier this month launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/openai-launches-new-macos-app-for-agentic-coding/\">a dedicated MacOS app for Codex</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The MacOS app was downloaded <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019219967250669741?s=20\">a million times within the first week</a> of release.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For all their potential, AI agents have been slow to make an impact in the enterprise, and one new startup is betting that the reason they haven’t is a lack of context. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched as part of Y Combinator’s 2025 summer cohort, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.trace.so/\">Trace</a> is a workflow orchestration startup aimed at filling that gap. The company maps complex corporate environments and processes so that agents have the context they need to scale quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“OpenAI and Anthropic are building these brilliant interns that can be leveraged within the company,” says Trace CEO Tim Cherkasov, referring to the AI labs’ tools. “We’re building the manager that knows where to put them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, the London-based company said it had raised $3 million in seed funding from Y Combinator, Zeno Ventures, Transpose Platform Management, Goodwater Capital, Formosa Capital, and WeFunder. Angel investors Benjamin Bryant and Kevin Moore also invested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trace’s system starts by building a knowledge graph from a company’s existing tools — systems like email, Slack, and Airtable that shape the day-to-day working life of the firm. With that context in place, users can prompt the system with a high-level task — like “We need to design a new microsite” or “Lets develop our 2027 sales plan” — and Trace will come back with a step-by-step workflow, delegating some tasks to AI agents and assigning others to human workers. When the system does invoke an AI agent, it will prompt it with the specific data needed to complete its sub-task. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea is to automate away the delicate work of on-boarding AI agents, one of the biggest blockers for actual deployment within companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With so many companies focused on agentic AI, Trace will have plenty of competition. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-launches-new-push-for-enterprise-agents-with-plugins-for-finance-engineering-and-design/\">Earlier this week</a>, Anthropic launched its own take on enterprise agents, focused on pre-built plugins for specific departmental functions. And many of the workplace productivity services Trace will be drawing from, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/jiras-latest-update-allows-ai-agents-and-humans-to-work-side-by-side/\">Atlassian’s Jira</a>, are launching their own agents, which will potentially compete with the startup’s system. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Trace’s founders believe their knowledge-graph approach will be the key to success, as they can build context engineering deep into the structure of agentic deployment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“2024 and 2025 was still about prompt engineering. Now we’ve moved from prompt engineering to context engineering,” says CTO Artur Romanov. “Whoever provides the best context at the right time is going to be the infrastructure on top of which the AI-first companies will be built. And we hope to be that infrastructure.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It looked great on paper but didn’t really work in real life,” Lucena said.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She had learned firsthand that hiring is typically based on markers of success like college degrees, previous work experience, and a gut instinct. But she knew there had to be a better way. So she developed Mappa and spent years creating a proprietary dataset based on hundreds of interviews that allowed her team to analyze behavior based on biomarkers indicated through people’s speech patterns. Through this process, the Mappa team found that to make the right hire the first time, a candidate can’t just be great on paper; they also have to be compatible.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s no trait that’s good or bad inherently; it’s more of what environment do you put that person in, and what roles are better aligned with people’s sort of tendencies and styles. So that’s how we’ve been thinking about defining compatibility,” Lucena said in the podcast interview. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mappa is powered by an all Latinx team that knows how frustrating it is to be overlooked based on superficial biases or a lack of the “correct” experiences. She describes them as underdogs that understand this problem on a personal level.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are all underdogs. We are all folks that have been overlooked in some degree. And I guess that makes it even more important that we are the ones building this,” Lucena said. “Having people like us building this technology, at the level we are doing, with the quality we are able to get to the market and serving our clients the way we do. It also opens up a door for others to come and join and know that there are multiple ways still to build technology.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucena’s best advice for early-stage founders who are hiring is to take your time and be sure the compatibility is there from the beginning to avoid the hassle of hiring, firing, and rehiring for the same role.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Isabelle Johannessen is our host. <a href=\"https://pod.link/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vWUZMNjEyNzkzNjQ5NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Build Mode</a> is produced and edited by Maggie Nye.

The study also found that children who faced stressful life events were more likely to struggle with regulating their social media use appropriately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the ongoing lawsuits accusing the company of failing to protect teens on its platforms, the timing of these new alerts isn’t exactly surprising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that it will aim to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, as overuse could reduce their overall effectiveness.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In working to strike this important balance, we analyzed Instagram search behavior and consulted with experts from our Suicide and Self-Harm Advisory Group,” Instagram explained in a blog post. “We chose a threshold that requires a few searches within a short period of time, while still erring on the side of caution. While that means we may sometimes notify parents when there may not be a real cause for concern, we feel — and experts agree — that this is the right starting point, and we’ll continue to monitor and listen to feedback to make sure we’re in the right place.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The alerts are rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada next week, and will become available in other regions later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the future, Instagram plans to launch these notifications when a teen tries to engage the app’s AI in conversations about suicide or self-harm. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/salesforce-acquires-informatica-for-8-billion/\">data management company </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/27/salesforce-acquires-informatica-for-8-billion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Informatica</a> last May.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Net income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, with <a href=\"https://x.com/anshublog/status/2018762793978413111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Salesforce as their poster child</a>, have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seat <a href=\"https://x.com/mcuban/status/2026690613014298881\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">business models obsolete</a>. The situation has been dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also revamped the earnings call itself. It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&amp;A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja; the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts; and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: They all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: agentic work units (“AWU”). The idea here is that instead of simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but really <a href=\"https://www.saastr.com/the-real-data-on-ai-agents-what-1-trillion-tokens-a-day-reveals-with-openrouters-coo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is not</a> in the AI world.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce president and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable piece of work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itself <a href=\"https://x.com/Benioff/status/2026803953342755116/photo/3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">owning most of the tech stack</a>, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/openai-launches-a-way-for-enterprises-to-build-and-manage-ai-agents/\">OpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier</a>. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data) <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2019413714341097945\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on the bottom as the unseen engines</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The round values Gushwork at $33 million post-money, up from about $7.5 million following its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/gushwork-ai-funding-lightspeed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lightspeed-led $2.1 million pre-seed</a> in July 2023, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The latest financing brings Gushwork’s total funding to $11 million, the startup said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding comes as AI companies, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-its-google-challenger-chatgpt-search/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/perplexity-received-780-million-queries-last-month-ceo-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Perplexity</a>, begin to chip away at traditional web search, prompting incumbents like Google to roll out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-generated overviews</a> and other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/google-now-lets-users-jump-from-ai-overviews-into-ai-mode-conversations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conversational features</a> across their search products. Gushwork is betting this shift will create a new opportunity to help businesses surface in AI-driven discovery channels using its automated marketing agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2023 by Nayrhit Bhattacharya (pictured above, right) and Adithya Venkatesh (pictured above, left), Gushwork initially focused on helping small and medium businesses outsource workflows using a mix of AI and human expertise. The startup began narrowing its focus toward search-led marketing after seeing strong customer demand for help with improving online visibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started, we were focused on helping businesses outsource faster and outsource better,” Bhattacharya told TechCrunch in an interview, adding that the pull around search from customers became increasingly hard to ignore.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s platform uses a network of AI agents to automatically generate and update search-optimized content; build backlinks — typically 10 to 20 per customer — through a network of roughly 200 to 300 partner websites; and track inbound leads through an integrated content management system. The goal, Bhattacharya said, is to help businesses surface in both traditional search results and AI-generated answers without relying on large in-house marketing teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says it has signed up more than 300 paying customers — roughly 95% of them in the U.S. — with subscriptions starting at $800 per month. Gushwork is currently running at about $1.5 million in annualized recurring revenue after rolling out its AI search-focused product around three months ago and is targeting $3 million to $3.5 million ARR in the next three months, Bhattacharya said, adding that the startup is growing about 50% to 80% month over month.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Across Gushwork’s customer base, about 20% of website traffic now comes from AI-driven search and chat platforms, but those sources account for around 40% of inbound leads, Bhattacharya said, citing the startup’s internal data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The higher-intent leads, Bhattacharya said, are already translating into business outcomes for some customers. In one case, a professional services client has closed between $200,000 and $350,000 worth of contracts after adopting the platform, he said, declining to disclose the customer’s name. He added that many users are seeing meaningful pipeline growth as AI-driven discovery gains traction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork’s customer base today is concentrated among high-ticket B2B service providers, industrial distributors, and contract manufacturers, primarily in the U.S., Bhattacharya said. The startup’s average subscription runs about $800 to $900 per month, or roughly $9,000 to $10,000 in annual contract value, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift toward AI-driven discovery is still in its early stages but is gaining momentum. Tools such as generative AI chatbots and AI web browsers are increasingly being used by buyers to research vendors and products. OpenAI said in July 2025 that ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/chatgpt-users-send-2-5-billion-prompts-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">received about 2.5 billion prompts a day</a> globally, including roughly 330 million from U.S. users. Bhattacharya said the trend is beginning to reshape how some businesses approach online visibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gushwork plans to use the new funding to expand its engineering team, improve model accuracy, and scale its go-to-market efforts, Bhattacharya said. He added that the startup has more than 800 businesses on its waitlist that it plans to begin onboarding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup, headquartered in Delaware with an office in Bengaluru, has about 70 employees in India, along with several contractors.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The acquisition marks the latest after Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/anthropic-acquires-bun-claude-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquired coding agent engine Bun</a> in December to help scale Claude Code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vercept had created tools for more complex agentic tasks, including its product Vy, a computer-use agent in the cloud that could operate a remote Apple MacBook. Vercept is one of the many startups working on re-imagining the personal computer for the age of AI agents. As part of the deal, Anthropic is shuttering Vercept’s product on March 25.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup was a grad of Seattle’s AI-focused <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/companies\">incubato</a><a href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">r</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/companies\"> A12,</a> which spawned from the longstanding Allen Institute for AI. Vercept’s co-founders had roots with the Allen Institute, as well, and were previously researchers there. One co-founder, Matt Deitke, made news last year as one of the AI researchers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/ai-researchers-nba-stars.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">who negotiated a monster $250 million salary</a> from Meta to join its Superintelligence Lab. On Wednesday, Deitke congratulated his former colleagues <a href=\"https://x.com/mattdeitke/status/2026758221424373787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in a post on X</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vercept was a relatively high-profile AI startup in the region. In a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vercept-joining-anthropic-kiana-ehsani-nddmf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn post</a> announcing the acquisition by Anthropic, Vercept CEO Kiana Ehsani said the startup had raised a total of $50 million. She called out A12’s Seth Bannon, a board member, as the lead investor. Vercept previously announced it had raised a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vercept_we-are-excited-to-announce-we-raised-our-activity-7335699688777531393-VrRy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$16 million seed round</a> last January.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The list of angel investors was impressive, too, and included former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, and Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2026/anthropic-acquires-vercept-in-early-exit-for-one-of-seattles-standout-ai-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GeekWire reported.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Anthropic’s announcement of the acquisition, the company named co-founders Ehsani, Luca Weihs, and Ross Girshick as some of the team brought on to join Anthropic in the acquisition. However, not all of Vercept’s co-founders are joining the Claude maker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oren Etzioni, who has <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2025/ex-allen-institute-for-ai-scientists-form-stealthy-ai-startup-with-former-ai2-ceo-oren-etzioni/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously been named</a> as a co-founder of Vercept and investor in the startup, is well known in Seattle as the founding leader of the Allen Institute for AI. Along with Deitke, he is also not joining Anthropic, and was vocally less pleased about the acqui-hire. He posted <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432470782834008066/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on LinkedIn</a>: “After a little bit more than a year, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/vercept/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vercept</a> is throwing in the towel and giving their customers 30 days to get off the platform. Sad. A fantastic team is joining Anthropic. I wish them the very best!”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Etzioni is also a professor at the University of Washington and known for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/oren-etzioni-is-one-successful-founder-2013-9#:~:text=Oren%20Etzioni%20Could%20Be%20The,You've%20Never%20Heard%20Of&amp;text=Decide.com%20announced%20on%20Friday,now%20go%20work%20for%20eBay.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other startups</a> he’s founded and backed as a VC. He did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Etzioni’s LinkedIn post, he accused Bannon, the Vercept lead investor, of being “partly responsible” for Vercept not hiring the correct business people. A back and forth ensued between the investors, with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432495494322597888/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bannon condemning</a> Etzioni’s remarks: “… you disparaged the heroic work of the founders for achieving an outcome most could only dream of,” Bannon replied in the LinkedIn string. They also accused each other of other less savory things like lying and legal threats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While public spats between investors are entertaining, and essentially meaningless, the underlying motivation is notable. The stakes are high to build the next big AI winner, and now a promising startup that raised a decently sized war chest will be tucked into Anthropic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Etzioni says he got a return on his money. Anthropic clearly wanted these researchers (perhaps — especially — with another of them at Meta).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Etzioni told GeekWire that he remains bummed. “I’m pleased to have gotten a positive return but obviously disappointed that after just a little over a year with so much traction, and such a fantastic team, we’re basically throwing in the towel,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders joining Anthropic, however, appear happy, according to CEO’s Ehsani’s LinkedIn post. “The choices were clear: we could build independently and work toward the same vision as two separate versions of it, or join forces with an incredible team and accelerate that vision into reality. The decision became an easy choice,” she said of joining Anthropic.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company reported $215 billion in revenue for the full year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As in previous quarters, the company did not report any revenue from chip exports to China, despite the recent lifting of export restrictions by the U.S. government. “While small amounts of H200 products for China-based customers were approved by the U.S. government, they have yet to generate any revenue, and we do not know whether any imports will be allowed into China,” Colette Kress, the company’s chief financial officer, said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress,” she continued, in an apparent reference to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/china-nvidia-moore-threads-trading-debut-1-billion-listing-ipo-shanghai-gpu-enflame-biren.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Moore Threads’ IPO in December</a>, “and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During the investor call, Huang also addressed the company’s pending investment in OpenAI, which has been <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/nvidia-is-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-30-billion-in-openai-source-says.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported at $30 billion</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We continue to work with OpenAI toward a partnership agreement.

Without compute, there’s no way to generate tokens. Without tokens, there’s no way to grow revenues,” Huang said. “We’ve reached the inflection point and we’re generating profitable tokens that are productive for customers and profitable for the cloud service providers”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Intrinsic will remain a distinct entity within Google but will work closely with Google DeepMind and will tap into Google’s Gemini AI models and cloud services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alphabet declined to share information regarding funding or purchase price.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intrinsic “graduated” into an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/alphabets-intrinsic-aims-to-make-industrial-robots-more-capable/\">independent Alphabet-owned company in 2021</a> after five years of development within Alphabet’s X, the company’s moonshot research division. Other companies that have graduated from X include robotaxi company Waymo and drone delivery company Wing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wendy Tan White has served as Intrinsic’s CEO since its spinout in 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hit the ground running. A few months after announcing its independence, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/alphabet-owned-intrinsic-is-acquiring-fellow-robotic-software-firm-vicarious/\">Intrinsic acquired Vicarious</a>, a fellow robotics software company, in April 2022. While the purchase price wasn’t disclosed, Vicarious had raised about $250 million from VCs and tech bigwigs like Jeff Bezos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few months later, Intrinsic <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/alphabets-intrinsic-acquires-darpa-backed-firm-behind-open-source-robotics-software/\">acquired several for-profit divisions</a> of Open Robotics, a nonprofit organization that builds hardware and software platforms for the robotics industry.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite this rapid expansion, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/12/alphabet-robotics-division-intrinsic-hit-with-layoffs/\">Intrinsic laid off 20% of its workforce</a> in January 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced its first product, Flowstate, just a few months later. Flowstate is a software platform for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/15/alphabets-intrinsic-launches-flowstate-a-robotic-app-development-platform/\">developing robotics workflows</a> aimed at developers that don’t have deep robotics experience — aligning with the company’s mission to make robotics more accessible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, the company has fine-tuned the technology, improved its simulation capabilities, and released its Intrinsic Vision AI model in late 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intrinsic announced a <a href=\"https://www.intrinsic.ai/blog/posts/foxconn-and-intrinsic-launch-joint-venture-to-build-the-ai-factory-of-the-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">joint venture with electronics manufacturer Foxconn</a> in October 2025 that entails the two companies working together on general-purpose intelligent robots to transform how electronics are manufactured, with the goal of full factory automation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company is working toward those goals with closer collaboration with Google’s AI prowess.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Combined with Google’s incredible AI and infrastructure, we’re going to unlock the promise of physical AI for a much broader set of manufacturing businesses and developers. This will fundamentally shift production, from its economics to operations, and enable truly advanced manufacturing,” Tan White wrote in the company’s blog post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This move makes a lot of sense for Google, as many tech leaders, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/how-a-once-tiny-research-lab-helped-nvidia-become-a-4-trillion-dollar-company/\">Nvidia’s Jensen Huang</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/08/from-factory-floors-offices-physical-ai-is-going-to-be-massive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Qualcomm’s Cristiano Amon</a>, see physical AI as the next natural step in the monetization and advancement of AI models and technology.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The social media giant says the awards show, called “The Snappys,” is designed to celebrate “the creators shaping culture on Snapchat.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creators will receive awards like “Spotlight MVP,” “Best Storyteller,” and “Breakout Creator of the Year,” alongside awards across fashion, beauty, sports, music, food, and games. Additional categories include collaboration, comedy, and cultural impact.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Together, these honors reflect the many ways creators spark conversations, build community, and define culture on Snapchat,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/first-ever-snappys-awards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “The Snappys reinforces Snapchat’s ongoing commitment to celebrating creators not just as users, but as artists, entertainers, and cultural leaders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat is the latest social media platform to launch awards for creators. Meta-owned Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/instagram-introduces-new-ring-award-for-top-creators/\">introduced a new “Ring” award</a> last October to recognize creators around the world. Instagram announced the 25 winners online, and each winner received a physical custom ring designed by English fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner, along with a digital golden ring around their Instagram profile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, TikTok launched its first-ever <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/tiktok-announces-its-first-awards-show-in-the-us/\">TikTok Awards show</a> in the U.S. Like Snapchat, Instagram handed out category-specific awards, like “Creator of the Year,” “Video of the Year,” “Muse of the Year,” “Breakthrough Artist of the Year,” and more. It’s worth noting that TikTok has also hosted awards shows in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, and Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat’s awards are more in line with TikTok’s, as it will also host a traditional awards show where the winners will be revealed live at the event. The company says the show will bring together “creators, industry leaders, and special guests.” One of the “special guests” is DJ Khaled, who will be receiving Snapchat’s “Lifetime Achievement Award.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By launching awards, Snapchat and its rivals are positioning themselves as more than just social media apps and as notable players in the entertainment industry. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Snappys will be hosted by comedian and creator Matt Friend and will take place at Snap‘s Santa Monica headquarters.

Williams sold the exploits to Operation Zero, which the U.S. government calls “one of the world’s most nefarious exploit brokers.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The successful conviction of Williams follows one of the most high-profile leaks of sensitive Western-made hacking tools in recent years. Even now that the case is over, there are still unanswered questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resided in Washington, D.C., was the general manager of Trenchant, the division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and its closest global intelligence partners. Prosecutors say <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/how-an-ex-l3-harris-trenchant-boss-stole-and-sold-cyber-exploits-to-russia/\">Williams took advantage of having “full access” to the company’s secure networks</a> to download the hacking tools onto a portable hard drive, and later to his computer. Williams contacted Operation Zero under a pseudonym though, so it’s unclear if Operation Zero ever knew Williams’ real identity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trenchant is a crew of hackers and bug hunters who dig deep into other popular software made by companies like Google and Apple, identify flaws in those millions of lines of code, then devise techniques to turn those flaws into workable exploits that can be used to reliably hack into those products. These tools are typically called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day</a> exploits because they take advantage of software flaws unknown to its developer, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/\">can be worth millions of dollars</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/\">U.S. Department of Justice alleged</a> that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed whoever used them to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the past few months, I have been talking to sources and reporting on Williams’ story before news broke that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/\">he had been arrested</a>. But what I had heard was patchwork and at times conflicting. I had heard someone had been arrested, but given the secret nature of the work involved in exploit development, proving it would be challenging.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">by email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a> \t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first heard of Williams, I wasn’t clear that I had even gotten his name right. At that point, his story was a rumor, moving through the hush-hush grapevine of zero-day exploit developers, sellers, and people with ties to the intelligence community. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I heard that maybe he was called John, or perhaps Duggan? Or all the different ways you can spell that in English. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the first rumors I heard were contradictory. Apparently he stole zero-days from Trenchant, and maybe he sold them to Russia, or perhaps another enemy of the United States and its allies, like North Korea or China? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took weeks just to confirm that there was indeed someone who even fit that description. (It turned out that Williams’ middle name is John, and Doogie is his nickname in hacker circles.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, as the weeks of reporting rolled on, things started to become much clearer. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-russian-connection\">The Russian connection</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/apple-alerts-exploit-developer-that-his-iphone-was-targeted-with-government-spyware/\">I first revealed in October</a>, Trenchant fired an employee after Williams, who was still at the time head of Trenchant, accused the employee of stealing and leaking Chrome zero-days. The story was even more intriguing because the employee told me that after he was fired, Apple notified him that someone had targeted his personal iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What I learned was just the tip of the iceberg. I had heard more from my sources, but we were still piecing parts of the story together. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after, prosecutors made their first formal accusation against a man named Peter Williams for stealing trade secrets, which first surfaced in the U.S. public court system. In that first court document, prosecutors confirmed that the buyer of these trade secrets was a buyer in Russia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there was no explicit reference to L3Harris nor Trenchant, nor the fact that the trade secrets that Williams stole were zero-days. Crucially, we still couldn’t confirm for certain that it was the same Peter Williams, who we thought would have access to highly sensitive exploits as Trenchant’s boss, and not some terrible case of mistaken identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We <em>still</em> weren’t there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a hunch and with nothing to lose, we contacted the Department of Justice to ask if they would confirm that the person in the document was in fact Peter Williams, the former boss of L3Harris Trenchant. A spokesperson confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/\">the story was out</a>. A week later, Williams pleaded guilty. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first heard of his story, while I trusted my sources, I remained skeptical. Why would someone like Williams do what the rumors claimed? But he did, and did so for money, prosecutors allege, which Williams then used to buy a house, jewelry, and luxury watches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a remarkable fall from grace for Williams, once seen as an accomplished and brilliant hacker, and especially for someone who previously worked at Australia’s top foreign spy agency and served in the country’s military. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096876\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg 4435w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">the L3Harris building in Burlington, Canada</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>JHVEPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-happened-to-the-stolen-exploits\">What happened to the stolen exploits?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We still don’t know specifically which exploits and hacking tools Williams stole and sold. Trenchant estimated a loss of $35 million, per court documents. But Williams’ lawyers said the stolen tools were not classified as a government secret.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We can glean some insight based on the circumstances of the case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that the Justice Department said the stolen tools could be used to hack “millions of computers and devices,” it’s likely the tools refer to zero-days in popular consumer software, such as Android devices, Apple’s iPhones and iPads, and web browsers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is some evidence pointing in their direction. During a hearing last year, prosecutors read out loud <a href=\"https://x.com/opzero_en/status/1706762507631677760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a post published on X</a> by Operation Zero, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/peter-williams-trenchant-trade-secrets-theft-russian-firm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to independent cybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter</a>, who attended the hearing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Due to high demand on the market, we’re increasing payouts for top-tier mobile exploits,” read the post, which specifically mentioned Android and iOS. “As always, the end user is a non-NATO country.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/russian-zero-day-seller-offers-20m-for-hacking-android-and-iphones/\">offers millions of dollars</a> for details of security vulnerabilities in Android devices and iPhones, messaging apps <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/russian-zero-day-seller-is-offering-up-to-4-million-for-telegram-exploits/\">like Telegram</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/prices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other kinds of software</a>, such as Microsoft Windows, and hardware vendors, such as several brands of servers and routers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/#:~:text=Baseband-,OUR%20CLIENTS,-Our%20clients%20are\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims</a> to work with the Russian government. At the time Williams sold the exploits to the Russian broker, Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was already underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the same day that Williams was sentenced, the U.S. Treasury <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/treasury-sanctions-russian-zero-day-broker-accused-of-buying-exploits-stolen-from-u-s-defense-contractor/\">announced it had imposed sanctions</a> against Operation Zero and its founder Sergey Zelenyuk, calling the company a national security threat. This was the government’s first confirmation that Williams had sold the exploits to Operation Zero. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its statement, the Treasury said the broker “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” At this point we don’t know who this user is. The user could be a foreign intelligence service, or it could be a ransomware gang, given that the Treasury also sanctioned Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, an alleged member of the Trickbot gang, who also allegedly worked with Operation Zero.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a court document, prosecutors said that L3Harris was able to figure out that “an unauthorized vendor was selling a component” of one of the stolen trade secrets “by comparing company-specific vendor data found on a stolen component that matched.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors also said that Williams “recognized code he wrote and sold” to Operation Zero “being utilized by a South Korean broker,” further suggesting that both L3Harris and prosecutors know which tools were stolen and sold to Operation Zero. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another unanswered question is: Did anyone, either the U.S. government or L3Harris, alert Apple, Google, or whichever tech company’s products were affected by the zero-day flaws, now that the exploits had leaked?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Any company or developer would want to know that someone could have used (or could still use) a zero-day against their users and customers so that they can patch the flaws as soon as possible. And at this point, the zero-days are of no use for L3Harris and its government customers.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I asked Apple and Google, neither company responded to my inquiries. L3Harris did not respond either. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-hacked-the-scapegoat-and-why\">Who hacked the scapegoat, and why?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s the mystery of the scapegoat, who was fired after Williams accused him of stealing and leaking code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At sentencing, Justice Department prosecutors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/\">confirmed</a> that the employee was fired, saying Williams “stood idly by while another employee of the company was essentially blamed for [his] own conduct.” In response, Williams’ attorney rebuffed prosecutors, claiming that the former employee “was fired for misconduct,” citing claims of dual-employment and improper handling of the company’s intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a court document submitted by Williams’ lawyers, as part of the L3Harris internal investigation, the company placed the employee on leave, seized his devices, transferred them to the U.S., and “offered them to the FBI.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, an unnamed FBI spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add apart from the Justice Department’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-general-manager-us-defense-contractor-sentenced-87-months-selling-stolen-trade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After being fired, that employee, whom we identified with the alias Jay Gibson, received a notification from Apple that his personal iPhone was targeted “with a mercenary spyware attack.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">sends</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/\">these</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/apple-alerted-iranians-to-iphone-spyware-attacks-say-researchers/\">notifications</a> to users it thinks were the target of attacks using tools like those made by NSO Group or Intellexa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Who tried to hack Gibson? He received the notification on March 5, 2025, more than six months after the FBI investigation had begun. The FBI “regularly interacted with [Williams] in late 2024 through the summer of 2025,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950140-usa-v-williams-24-doj-sentencing-memo/?q=october&amp;mode=document#document/p5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to a court document</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the nature of the leaked tools, it is plausible that the FBI, or perhaps even a U.S. intelligence agency, targeted Gibson as part of the investigation into Williams’ leaks. But we just don’t know, and there’s a chance that neither the public, nor Gibson, will ever find out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated to clarify 22nd paragraph attributing the tools’ lack of classification to Williams’ lawyers.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The display tech will offer a smarter and more flexible alternative to privacy films, which are overlaid on top of a smartphone’s screen to limit viewing unless you’re looking directly at the phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Samsung pointed out, these traditional privacy films come with trade-offs — like dimmer screens or more difficulties when you’re trying to show someone else something on your phone. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096922\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg 1962w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=768,436 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=1200,681 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=1280,727 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=430,244 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=720,409 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=900,511 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=800,454 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=1536,872 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=668,379 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=660,375 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=1087,617 1087w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=708,402 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/privacy-screen-notification-blacked-out.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Samsung</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its solution is a new display technology for mobile devices that uses two different types of pixels: narrow pixels and wide pixels. This architecture, which Samsung dubbed Black Matrix, will narrow the path of light emitted from each pixel to precisely control the light visible to you when the privacy mode is enabled. When it’s turned off, a widened standard pixel works with the narrow pixels to deliver the light in every direction.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096921\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg 2016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=1200,668 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=1280,712 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=430,239 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=720,401 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=900,501 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=800,445 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=1536,855 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=668,372 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=1109,617 1109w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=708,394 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/turning-privacy-screen-on-and-off.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">samsung</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Samsung</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Privacy Display feature is also customizable, so you can set certain apps or notifications to trigger privacy mode, while others are viewed normally.

The updated ring comes equipped with a number of features, including an AI “agent coach” designed to keep users on track to attain their fitness goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS says it differentiates itself from other wearables by not just delivering health metrics but also incentivizing healthy behavior through a points system. Users garner digital “health points” for healthy behaviors — things like daily sleep, 10,000 steps every day, sports activities, and conversations with the ring’s AI coach — which can then be redeemed through an integrated marketplace for discounts on health supplements and other products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring’s AI Agent Coach, meanwhile, is designed to leverage generative AI to aid with healthy programs for exercise and daily health. The company says that its agent generates tailored programs including “daily tasks, recovery protocols, supplement recommendations, and direct referrals to licensed medical professionals.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring also tracks a host of body metrics and daily behaviors, such as sleep quality, stress management, movement, and recovery. This helps them see how these metrics affect their Pace of Aging (PoA), showing whether their body is aging faster or slower than their chronological age, the company explains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS CEO and co-founder Edison Chen told TechCrunch that since his company’s first wearable was launched in 2024, the company has sold over 30,000 units across its first two models. The app’s user base has also grown to 250,000 users across 103 countries, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our strongest markets so far have been North America, Europe, and Asia,” Chen said. “What we’re good at is pattern recognition for healthy people trying to optimize,” Chen told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AI spots when you’re trending in the wrong direction, such as chronic poor sleep, declining HRV, elevated resting heart rate, and either suggests lifestyle changes or connects you to a professional. The control is in the escalation pathway to the right care access,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims that it keeps user data encrypted and secure via the Solana blockchain. It has previously <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shop.cudis.xyz/blogs/news/smarter-rings-and-things-7-ways-to-wear-ai\">been described</a> as a “web3 AI wellness company.” (TechCrunch was not able to test the smart ring directly to verify its security claims.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS announced $5 million of seed funding in 2024. The round was led by Draper Associates and included a number of other investors, including a number of blockchain-associated investor groups like Skybridge, DraperDragon, Monke Ventures, and Foresight Ventures, among others. The company also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cudis/cudis-sporty-ring-1st-smart-ring-you-can-style-and-earn-with\">plans to launch</a> a Kickstarter soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
