You can then choose what style of photo you’d like to color — such as anime, 3D movie, manga, cartoon, or comic.

To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research\">OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/openai-unveils-a-new-chatgpt-agent-for-deep-research/\">called deep research</a> that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-january-2025\"><strong>January 2025</strong></h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-used-a-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion\">OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-used-this-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion/\">measure the persuasive abilities</a> of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/openai-inks-deal-to-train-ai-on-reddit-data/\">posts from the subreddit</a> and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model\">OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI launched a new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-launches-o3-mini-its-latest-reasoning-model/\">AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,</a> the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/openai-announces-new-o3-model/\">previewed the model in December</a> alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-chatgpt-s-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says\">ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/chatgpts-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says/\">over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users</a> are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-us-government-agencies\">OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/openai-launches-chatgpt-plan-for-u-s-government-agencies/\">designed to provide U.S. government agencies</a> an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-tech-s-faults\">More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/more-teens-report-using-chatgpt-for-schoolwork-despite-the-techs-faults/\">according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.</a> In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days\">OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously/\">the company’s AI “agent” tool,</a> for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-says-it-may-store-deleted-operator-data-for-up-to-90-days/\">which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.</a></p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously\">OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously/\">take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.</a> Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operator, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/openais-agent-tool-may-be-nearing-release/\">OpenAI’s agent tool,</a> could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openais-agent-tool-will-be-available-to-users-paying-200-per-month-for-pro/\">Operator will be available as an early research preview</a> to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/arrakis_ai/status/1882343287522226591\">a user on X who goes by Choi</a> spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups\">OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/openai-tests-letting-users-sign-up-for-chatgpt-with-only-a-phone-number/\">sign up with only a phone number</a> — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks\">ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks/\">allows users to set simple reminders</a>. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z\">New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/chatgpts-newest-feature-lets-user-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z/\">customize their interactions with ChatGPT.</a> Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Makuh90/status/1877479064967295484\">some users reported</a> that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-faqs\">FAQs:</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is ChatGPT? How does it work?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai/\">OpenAI</a>. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When did ChatGPT get released?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the latest version of ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/openais-newest-model-is-gpt-4o/\">GPT-4o</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I use ChatGPT for free?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a free version of <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/auth/login?next=/chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT</a> that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT Plus</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who uses ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/microsofts-new-bing-was-using-gpt-4-all-along/\">search engines</a> are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What companies use ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/apple-reportedly-limits-internal-use-of-ai-powered-tools-like-chatgpt-and-github-copilot/\">limit the use of the AI-powered tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/windows-11-gets-an-ai-copilot/\">Microsoft announced</a> at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/looking-glass-taps-chatgpt-for-holograms-you-can-talk-to/\">Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT</a> to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/solana-chatgpt-blockchain/\">Solana officially integrated the chatbot</a> into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT write essays?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT commit libel?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/the-great-pretender/\">Due to the nature of how these models work</a>, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We will see how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT</a> will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an app?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/chatgpts-mobile-app-revenue-saw-biggest-spike-yet-following-gpt-4o-launch/\">there is a free ChatGPT mobile app</a> for iOS and Android users.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the ChatGPT character limit?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an API?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/openai-launches-an-api-for-chatgpt-plus-dedicated-capacity-for-enterprise-customers/\">released</a> March 1, 2023.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How good is ChatGPT at writing code?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you save a ChatGPT chat?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. There are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/17/developers-are-looking-for-creative-ways-to-build-ai-powered-chatbot-assistants/\">multiple AI-powered chatbot</a> competitors such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.together.xyz/\">Together</a>, Google’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/what-is-google-gemini-ai/\">Gemini</a> and Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/anthropic-launches-claude-a-chatbot-to-rival-openais-chatgpt/\">Claude</a>, and developers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/theres-now-an-open-source-alternative-to-chatgpt-but-good-luck-running-it/\">creating open source</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meet-the-team-developing-an-open-source-chatgpt-alternative/\">alternatives</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out <a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this form</a>. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “<a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request</a>”.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">here</a> for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/jailbreak-tricks-discords-new-chatbot-into-sharing-napalm-and-meth-instructions/\">two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine</a> (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Australian mayor has publicly announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/06/australian-mayor-prepares-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">he may sue OpenAI for defamation</a> due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Futurism reported</a> the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">accused</a> of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several major school systems and colleges, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/as-nyc-public-schools-block-chatgpt-openai-says-its-working-on-mitigations-to-help-spot-chatgpt-generated-text/\">including New York City Public Schools</a>, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">not every educator agrees with</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have also been cases of ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">accusing individuals of false crimes</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is <a href=\"https://promptbase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PromptBase</a>. Another is <a href=\"https://chatx.ai/marketplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatX</a>. More launch every day.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT be detected?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/openai-releases-tool-to-detect-ai-generated-text-including-from-chatgpt/\">tests</a>, they’re inconsistent at best.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are ChatGPT chats public?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. But OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649806/chatgpt-chat-histories-bug-exposed-disabled-outage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">recently</a> disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/28/23575919/microsoft-openai-github-dismiss-copilot-ai-copyright-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">involved</a> in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is continually updated with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

TikTok Shop has also recently expanded into <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/tiktok-shop-pushes-into-luxury-retail-with-11-000-handbags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">luxury retail</a>, another move to solidify its footing in e-commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can load the gift cards with anything from $10 to $500. What sets these cards apart is the ability to personalize them using a wide variety of animated designs.

It wasn’t until late Sunday afternoon that a Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement that the company was resuming service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” the spokesperson said. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Waymo spokesperson added that the company is “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The blackout also took down many of the city’s traffic lights and affected Muni mass transit, with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=849547921115149\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">warning residents to stay off the roads</a> unless they needed to travel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo said that although its self-driving systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops, the scale of Saturday’s blackout caused some robotaxis to remain stationary for longer than normal as they tried to assess the intersections.

They were founded a long time ago and became popular even before the pandemic, and really were thought of as an industry leader, as far as quality of the bikes that they’re making, pretty good branding and marketing, and trying to connect with customers — which is really hard to find in the world of e-bikes, where most of them are just like alphabet soup companies on Amazon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They rode that wave in the pandemic up high as micromobility really took off, and people were really rethinking how they were getting around, they weren’t commuting into the office as much. And we get glimpses of that in the bankruptcy filings. It only shows revenue back three years, but they were pulling in well over $100 million in revenue in 2023 — like $123 million, I think that fell to about $100 [million] last year, and through the bankruptcy this year, they were only at about $63 million, so they were clearly coming down off a pretty big high. They have a pretty diverse product lineup, but they just never really found a way to establish a foothold there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And I think you could say similar things about these other two companies. Luminar is another company that was founded in the early 2010s, came out of stealth in 2017, and its mission was essentially to take lidar sensors, which at the time were really expensive and big and really only used in, like, defense applications and aerospace. 2017 was sort of the first big hype cycle of autonomous vehicles. They wanted to apply those sensors, make them more affordable for that use case. That helped them get some deals, most notably with Volvo, and then some other deals with Mercedes-Benz, and a couple other players. But they were just heavily concentrated in that, and that was one of the reasons they wound up filing this week, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then iRobot [was] the most well known of these three companies — a lot of people listening probably even have a Roomba at home or something very like it. It’s just another one of these situations where iRobot became synonymous with a certain thing, and then the advances in the technology that build that product move so quickly that they wound up in a situation where they were looking for a way out. And we all saw this, they were trying to get acquired by Amazon, and that deal got blocked by the FTC and so here we are. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They’re very different companies, but they all ran into similar problems. Do either of you guys have a Roomba?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Rebecca:</strong> No, I don’t have a Roomba. Those freak me out, but I bought my mom a Rad Power bike years ago, and she loves it. But now, you know, they had not only this bankruptcy issue, but they also had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/rad-power-bikes-batteries-receive-major-fire-risk-warning/\">the issue with the batteries</a> — they weren’t able to do their recalls because they were, like, “If we have to recall these bikes, we’re going to go bankrupt.” But they’re going bankrupt anyway! </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m curious about the tariff thing, and how much this affected everyone’s bottom lines. You hear a lot on social media, people who are pro merger, how certain FTC blockings of [mergers] leads to the companies going bankrupt, or getting acquired by a Chinese firm rather than an American firm. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Sean:</strong> iRobot represents, to me, the sort of macro global trade problem of, could you have ever built this company here in the United States with a localized supply chain over the last 15 years? Probably not. And so it makes sense that they became so heavily reliant on China — which, let’s be real, probably led to the ability for these other companies to pop up and essentially copy what they did. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That reminds me of in Trump 1, when he flipped on tariffs for Chinese imports, and we saw a bunch of startups like Boosted Boards and other ones in the micromobility space get hit. So they’re contributing factors, for sure. The battery recall with Rad Power absolutely was, I think, a bigger dagger at the end, but the tariff stuff put them on uneven footing that made it harder for them to respond to stuff like that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Anthony:</strong> A lot of times when a company fails, there [are] larger structural issues, and then there’s maybe a more immediate proximate issue. And particularly in the case of iRobot, I think that a lot of former executives and even outside commentators are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/it-felt-so-wrong-colin-angle-on-irobot-the-ftc-and-the-amazon-deal-that-never-was/\">pointing to this Amazon deal</a> that was reached a few years ago — it kind of looked like the EU was not going to allow it to go through, and there is this sense of, “Okay, well, by blocking this deal, you’ve essentially put the dagger in their heart that eventually killed the company.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That narrative also maybe ignores the fact that there were other things that caused them to want to get acquired in the first place.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"From Roombas to e-bikes, why are hardware startups going bankrupt? | Equity Podcast\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrS5WPrHVns?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The electric bike company filed for <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/rad-power-bikes-files-for-bankruptcy-and-is-looking-to-sell-the-business/\">Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a>, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding. A spokesperson told TechCrunch the company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And then there is troubled lidar maker <strong>Luminar</strong>, which also <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lidar-maker-luminar-files-for-bankruptcy/\">filed for bankruptcy</a> this week. The Luminar bankruptcy does not seem like a let’s-help-it-live-another-day type of situation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Luminar filing, which occurred after months of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/luminar-is-cutting-jobs-losing-its-cfo-and-warning-of-a-cash-shortage/\">layoffs</a>, executive departures, and a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/luminar-is-fighting-with-its-biggest-customer-as-bankruptcy-threat-looms/\">legal fight</a> with its largest customer, Volvo, notes the company plans to sell off the business. It has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it’s completed, senior reporter <strong>Sean O’Kane</strong> reported. Want to learn more? I recommend reading O’Kane’s piece that looks at how <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\">Luminar’s doomed Volvo deal helped drag the company into bankruptcy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even though the year was bookended by some failures, that doesn’t mean 2025 wasn’t filled with innovation and growth. The emerging robotaxi industry has indeed <em>emerged</em>. With that I have noticed new kinds of autonomous vehicle-adjacent companies popping up, and I expect that to become a trend in 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The scale of robotaxis was largely driven by <strong>Waymo’s</strong> fast-paced growth, although <strong>Zoox</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong> have also started to set up shop. This next year could be when we see these companies really squaring off in the same markets; it will also be the year when companies will face even greater scrutiny over safety and how robotaxis fit into daily life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, EVs have had their struggles this year and automakers have struggled to adjust.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, <strong>Ford</strong> is pivoting yet again. The company said this week it is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/fords-next-f-150-lightning-will-have-a-gas-generator-as-it-pivots-away-from-large-evs/\">ending production</a> of the fully-electric F-150 Lightning as part of a broader companywide shake-up that will put more emphasis on hybrids and gas-powered vehicles. As part of its shift, Ford is turning to the increasingly popular “extended range electric vehicle” version of the truck, which adds a gas generator that can recharge the battery pack to power the motors for over 700 miles. It’s also getting into the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/ford-is-starting-a-battery-storage-business-to-power-data-centers-and-the-grid/\">energy storage business</a> — gotta do something with all those batteries — and says it is still committed to producing a midsized electric truck that will go on sale in 2027. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But hey, the EV is not dead. And the promise of smaller, more affordable ones are looming in the near distance with the imminent launch of <strong>Rivian’s</strong> R2 and <strong>Slate Auto’s</strong> electric truck. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Housekeeping note</strong>: This is the last newsletter of the year.

The company only holds a permit to test autonomous vehicle technology with a human safety operator located behind the wheel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Tesla is facing a tricky situation in California. Here’s the gist: An administrative law judge agreed with the case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and ruled Tesla <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-marketing-for-autopilot-and-full-self-driving-judge-rules/\">engaged in deceptive marketing</a> that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver-assistance software. The DMV wanted to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its action, and a judge has agreed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ah, but wait. The DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to comply. That gives Tesla two options if it wants to keep those licenses: drop the Autopilot name or ship software to its cars that make them autonomous.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-one-more-thing\">One more thing …</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of you might not know that I am also co-host of <strong>Equity</strong>, a TechCrunch’s podcast about the business of startups.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The future may be electric, but that future is being postponed. The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate. This change is part of a broader “<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_3051\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Automotive Package</a>” designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“China already dominates EV manufacturing,” said Craig Douglas, a partner at World Fund, a European climate-focused venture capital firm. “If Europe doesn’t compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Douglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Senior executives from companies including Cabify, EDF, Einride, Iberdrola, and numerous EV-related startups signed the letter, exhorting the Commission to “stand firm” on the original 2035 zero-emission target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their appeal wasn’t enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. But continuing pressure has sparked debate within the startup community and beyond about the best path for Europe if it’s to remain competitive during the energy transition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Industry split on timeline</strong></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even within the auto industry, opinions differ. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for many years to come.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike Mercedes-Benz and other manufacturers, the Swedish carmaker had no concerns about meeting the 2035 ban. Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Issam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. “History shows that this kind of flexibility has never worked out well,” said Tidjani, who also signed the Take Charge Europe letter this fall. “It delays scale, weakens learning curves, and ultimately costs industrial leadership rather than preserving it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be fair, the Commission hasn’t completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The company, hoping to succeed where Swedish battery maker Northvolt struggled, opened its first large-scale battery factory in Northern France this week. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe’s battery industry.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Mixed signals</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU’s commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Already, traditional carmakers have begun complaining that the carbon offset requirements could make cars more expensive for consumers, potentially undermining the very competitiveness the policy change was meant to protect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another uncertainty involves the United Kingdom. It’s unclear whether the U.K. will follow the EU’s lead and modify its own 2035 combustion engine ban. Unlike both the European Union and the United States, the U.K. hasn’t yet imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, despite that their rapidly increasing sales in the British market have raised concerns among domestic manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The debate highlights ongoing tensions in climate policy between how to balance the economic realities facing existing industries with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner tech. As Europe tries to thread this needle, the decisions made now will invariably impact whether the continent leads or lags in the global EV market.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He was forced to step down from the firm he founded, OurCrowd, after he was diagnosed with the debilitating disease of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS,) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This has come rather sudden,” he told TechCrunch in an audibly hoarse voice — a symptom of ALS — on what could be his last interview. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I had been feeling a little weird before and they didn’t know what was ailing me,” he explained. “I was in the hospital for several weeks recovering, and that’s when they tested me and said, ‘You’ve got ALS,’ which is a horrible disease, the worst you can imagine.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ALS is a condition that degrades the brain’s motor neurons, leading to loss of muscle control, eventually impairing walking, talking, eating, and breathing. He didn’t have the classic symptoms, as his voice was attacked first, not his extremities, he said. But he knows that the condition will worsen, and there is no cure, only therapies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Medved is considered one of the fathers of Israel’s startup ecosystem — often called “Startup Nation” after the decades-old <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Start-up-Nation-Israels-Economic-Miracle-ebook/dp/B004QZ9P6K/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">best-selling book</a> of the same name. He helped usher it in, having moved from California to Israel in his 20s, then founding and selling several tech companies before turning to investing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2013, he founded OurCrowd. While Israel has <a href=\"https://visible.vc/blog/venture-capital-in-israel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many powerful home-grown VC firms</a>, as well as branches of global firms like Bessemer, OurCrowd essentially invented crowdsourced venture capital, where a limited partnership was open to any <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/learn/what-is-an-accredited-investor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">accredited investor.</a> </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s roster attracted LPs from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America, growing a network of 240,000 accredited investor LPs in 195 countries, the firm says. Many of them are doctors, lawyers, and ordinary people who not only help their investment companies, but would have otherwise been cut out of the wealth generation that VCs experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OurCrowd has backed names like Anthropic, Beyond Meat, and Lemonade. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Medved describes OurCrowd as now a “significant player” backing about 500 portfolio companies with about 74 exits, including an exit a couple of weeks ago when its infrastructure-planning startup Locusview sold for $525 million <a href=\"https://www.locusview.com/resources/locusview-to-be-acquired-by-itron-accelerating-digital-construction-management-for-utilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to Itron.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite Israel’s conflict with Gaza, which has impacted its citizens and put the nation in global crosshairs over the Palestinian humanitarian crisis, its startup ecosystem has remained strong.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the “startup nation,” Israel remains a key player for <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-latest-military-tech-tested-in-gaza-wanted-by-the-west-3d9add02\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">cybersecurity and defense tech</a> as well as AI, microchips, enterprise software, food tech, health tech — the whole tech stack. For example, in November, there was “$800 million invested in the Israeli venture ecosystem in one week,” Medved said. The country now has nearly 100 unicorns and over the year, he estimates that between $15 billion and $16 billion was invested in the country in venture deals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now the tech of some of these startups will help him navigate life with an incurable condition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, he’s had an avatar made of himself that preserves his voice, face, and mannerisms. (The photo/video realistic digital twin is pictured and the full video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFQdTy0ohss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">can be seen here</a>.) OurCrowd AI portfolio company D-ID, maker of agents and avatars, partnered with voice <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/elevenlabs-just-hit-a-6-6b-valuation-its-ceo-says-the-real-money-isnt-in-voice-anymore/\">AI startup ElevenLabs</a> and other companies through the ALS-focused <a href=\"https://www.scottmorganfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Scott-Morgan Foundation</a> to create an avatar system designed for people with ALS.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He just experienced this tech during a Zoom call with another person who has ALS who was using the avatar to communicate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So this stuff has become very, very personal to me,” Medved said. “It will preserve my voice when it goes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he said there will be a variety of startups whose tech he will lean on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve made 60, 70 healthcare investments in good companies that help people. We’ve got a company called OncoHost, which uses AI to help select what kind of immunotherapy will actually work for you. We have companies doing next-generation sequencing for the genome. We have companies doing chronic condition management,” he catalogs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I tell you now as a once-healthy person [who took health for granted] I felt human pain and disease, but once you are actually engaged in one of these nasty diseases, it changes your perspective,” Medved shared.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this means that, even though he’s given up his position running the company and may be retiring from the public eye, “I’m far from over, ok? I want to continue to contribute, both to OurCrowd and the overall ecosystem. So I fully intend to not go off [quietly] into this good night.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And in the end, he says “I’m very proud that in a small way, even though all we are is investors, to be part of this movement.” <br><br>A video featuring Medved’s “digital twin” demonstrates just how realistic his avatar already is.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jon Medved OurCrowd Avatar\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFQdTy0ohss?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Roomba maker, which had sold over 50 million robots since its 2002 launch, had survived 35 years of near-death experiences and technical challenges only to be undone by what founder Colin Angle calls “avoidable” regulatory opposition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The collapse followed Amazon’s January 2024 decision to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-irobot-scrap-acquisition-deal-7072122f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfql3LJk9Osar827PELG38TCJJbE95-p1TzzLtBDgqJS6dhOh_JQfR1L4xplW0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693f68b4&amp;gaa_sig=7DEtWR6zUVdLHZ4Tth-Tie0umvKh-jgAtvdhEmOHhkT_FrXMJOg5o2EKWOPSzqqdOuIFBXHvI82JOSpTXJscJw%3D%3D\">scuttle</a> its $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot after 18 months of investigation by the FTC and European regulators. In this candid conversation, Angle reflects on what he describes as a profoundly frustrating process, the chilling message it sends to entrepreneurs, and his determination to move forward with a new venture in consumer robotics. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>TC: You called the bankruptcy “avoidable” and a “tragedy for consumers.” Walk me through what you think regulators got wrong in blocking the Amazon acquisition.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CA: I think there’s a real lesson around the role of the FTC and the European Commission. The goal, of course, is to avoid the abuses that can happen in monopolies and with the goal of protecting consumer choice and protecting innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot’s trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier. In the EU, we had a 12% market share [but it was] declining where the number one competitor was only three years old in the market, which is nearly the definition of a vibrant and dynamic marketplace. And in the United States, iRobot’s market share was higher, but it was declining and there were multiple growing competitors bringing outside innovation into the marketplace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This should have been a no-brainer. This should have been three, four weeks of investigation. What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What was that 18-month process actually like? What were you being asked to do?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The amount of money and time spent was indescribable. I would not be surprised if over 100,000 documents were created and delivered. iRobot invested a significant part of our discretionary earnings against fulfilling the requirements that went along with doing the transaction. Amazon was forced to invest many, many, many times that. There was a whole team, both internal and external employees and lawyers and economists working to try to, in as many different ways as possible — because it seemed like our message was falling on deaf ears — demonstrate that this acquisition was not going to create a monopolistic situation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There was daily activity for 18 months associated with this. Perhaps most telling, when I was testifying as part of being deposed, I had a chance to walk the halls of the FTC. The examiners on their office doors had printouts of deals blocked, like trophies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Trophies?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To me, it felt so wrong as an entrepreneur who started this thing literally in my living room and lived six and a half years never having enough money in the bank to make payroll, finally making it through succeeding. Here’s an agency whose stated mission is protecting consumer interests and helping the United States economy, celebrating as victories every time they shut down M&amp;A, which in a very real way is the primary driver of value creation for the innovation economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I went into this deposition looking for a friend. It’s like, “Here we are, we’re obviously not in a stronger place, and here’s a great opportunity for us. Are you excited for us?” Maybe this is just my naïve take coming out, but that’s not the reception I got. It was, “Why should we ever let them do this?” It’s like: because it’s good for the consumer — because it’s going to catalyze innovation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>How do you think what happened here changes the calculus for startup founders who see acquisition as their exit strategy? Do you think we’re in a world where American tech companies can’t scale through M&amp;A?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Risk has a chilling effect. If you’re an entrepreneur, your only option is to hope that it doesn’t happen again. The reason you and I are talking is I hope by my words I can make it less likely that it will happen again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I founded a new company and my outlook on exit strategy and even commercialization strategy is impacted by the experiences I had at iRobot. How can it not be? That precedent creates risk of it happening again, and only through positive experiences do we start to dial down the anxiety that the exits I’m depending on — or as a venture capitalist, the exits I’m investing in assuming will happen — will actually come through. That risk is factored into the willingness to invest, the valuation of deals, and the rate of new company formation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to say there’s X percent fewer entrepreneurial starts or exits as a result of the chilling message, but it certainly didn’t help. Entrepreneurs can use every leg up that we as a nation can provide. It is a rugged journey. When it actually works out, it should be a celebration. The FTC is there as a safeguard against very real examples of things gone too far. I’m a big believer in checks and balances. But when things get out of whack, the country suffers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Let’s talk about iRobot’s journey. The Roomba didn’t come out for 12 years after the company was founded. Tell me about those early days.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">iRobot was a bunch of people in an academic lab saying, “We were promised robots. Where are the robots?” If I could be pissed off that I don’t have the robots we were promised, I should do something about it. If not us, who? If not now, when?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the co-founders, my professor Rod Brooks, had pioneered an AI technology which allowed the embedding of machine intelligence in low-cost robotics. The mission of the company was to build cool stuff, deliver a great product, have fun, make money, and change the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first business plan was “private mission to the moon, sell the movie rights.” We were maybe the first company to fail to do exactly that. But the technology we developed led to additions to the Mars Pathfinder mission — my name’s up on Mars. We built robots that went into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. We built the PackBot, which was the first robot ever deployed in a combat mission for the US Army, went into caves in Afghanistan, and became the primary methodology for diffusing improvised explosive devices. We would get postcards: “You saved my life today.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the Fukushima disaster happened, we donated half a million dollars worth of robots to Japan. We sent six people over to train Tokyo Electric Power Company employees. Those robots were the first inside the reactor doors, mapped out radiation levels, and found a path where an employee could run in, get to the control room, work for a minute and a half, run back out, and only receive a lifetime dose of radiation. We were credited with enabling the shutdown of the reactor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>And then year 12, the Roomba?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I had a team that was working on toys, and one of the guys said, “Colin, I think it’s time we can do this. We can finally make the vacuum.” I’m like, “Okay, here’s $15,000. Two weeks. See what you can do.” Two weeks later they came back and said, “Hey, that’s not bad. Maybe there’s something here.” We scraped and found a little bit of money [to build these]. A year and a half later, I convinced my board that we could build 10,000 of these robots and we launched them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s really the media that picked up the story. We had no money for marketing. Reporters were fascinated because we tended to do interesting things that were real, and they couldn’t believe that robot vacuuming could possibly be real. [The reaction was:] “My God, it actually worked.” We ended up selling 70,000 robots in the first three months. Then we nearly went out of business the next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Because you couldn’t accommodate demand?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because we screwed up. The press drove this huge initial demand — 70,000 robots. So next year we’re going to do four times that. We made 300,000 robots. We even made a television commercial, but we were a bunch of geek engineers, so it totally failed. After Cyber Monday we were sitting with 250,000 robots in our warehouse like, “Oh my God, the world’s going to end.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then something good happened. The guy running our website said, “Why did sales quadruple yesterday?” We hadn’t done anything. What had happened was Pepsi had started running a TV ad with Dave Chappelle. He walks into this beautiful home, picks up a potato chip, and a Roomba comes out. He’s like, “A vacuum cleaner!” He throws down the potato chip, the vacuum eats it, then chases him. His pants are ripped off. He stands up in boxers. A beautiful woman appears, and he says, “Your vacuum cleaner ate my pants.” We sold 250,000 robots in two weeks and realized we knew nothing about marketing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Wow! You had no idea Pepsi was incorporating your product into its commercial?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No idea. It was wild. You try to do good for so long and you get smacked in the face so many times, and then sometimes something good happens. You could say because of that crazy moment in time, we have robots. When we think about just how fragile a journey it is — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt5rBfNucc\">cats riding Roombas</a> was a big part of why we succeeded. Does that make any sense? No, not at all. But we certainly didn’t expect tens of billions of views of cats riding Roombas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>At some point you started seeing Chinese competitors like Roborock and Ecovacs adopting lidar navigation years before iRobot. Why did you stick with vision-based navigation for so long?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We explicitly did not put lasers on the robot. We had the technology decades ago because it’s a dead-end technology. Under my strategic direction, we were going to invest every penny of cost against a vision-based nav and situational understanding system. Your Tesla does not have a laser on it. It is all vision-based. At least Elon agrees with me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Our strategic plan was for Roomba to be much more than just a vacuum cleaner in the home. To do that, it needs to understand more. Lasers are not advanced technology — they’ve been around for decades. They’re an expedient solution to a subset of the problems that a robot at home needs to take on. A laser will never tell you whether you actually cleaned the floor or not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is absolutely true that Chinese competition was coming in at lower price points. We were late in building a two-in-one robot — we believed that by separating mopping and vacuuming you could give a better customer experience. The customer voted that we were wrong, and that’s okay. We certainly were first in auto-evac, first in navigation. We were also importantly excluded from the Chinese marketplace, which is the largest market for consumer robotics in the world. That didn’t help.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>What learnings from your iRobot experience would you share with other robotics entrepreneurs?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first thing I tell all robotics entrepreneurs is: make sure you understand your market so that you are building something that delivers more value than it costs to create. Robots are so exciting, so sexy that it’s really easy to convince yourself that you’re doing something that is going to change the world, if only consumers were smart enough to realize it. That’s a pretty tough equation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Technology is oftentimes in the robot space well ahead of the business plans that can take advantage of the technology. One of the traps is thinking of robotics as a thing as opposed to a toolkit. As soon as you say, “I’m going to build a robot,” and head off building your humanoid — are you really doing it because you understand a problem you’re trying to solve, or are you enamored with building your thing?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I started iRobot, it was just assumed that robots were going to vacuum floors by building humanoids to push upright vacuum cleaners. When we first built Roomba, we would ask people, “Is that a robot?” People would say, “No, that’s not a robot. A robot has arms and legs and a head.” Yet Roomba at the time cost 10,000 times less than a humanoid pushing an upright vacuum.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The challenge of entrepreneurship is breaking through the romance and opportunity and falling in love with your technology and getting to the application that you’re trying to solve. Understand your consumer, understand the problem you’re trying to solve — because it’s complicated, robotics is expensive, and it takes a lot of energy to get right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>You mentioned you’ve founded a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.familiarmachines.com/\">new company</a>. What can you tell me about it?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re in stealth mode, but I’ll give you a broad hint. It’s consumer-facing. We’re really looking at the fact that most of the things robots can do to meet outstanding needs require us to interact with other people. So how do we build a robot that actually has sufficient emotional sophistication — not human-level, but enough — to build an enduring co-character that can make sense over time and use that for health and wellness related applications?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s going to be awesome. I’m so excited about it. It’s given me enthusiasm and energy to have a chance to use this new toolkit and continue on my journey to build the robots we were promised. I really haven’t changed that much from a grad student in college saying, “Oh my God, we’ve been promised robots and we don’t have the ones that I want yet.” I spent 30 years focused on building the world’s greatest floor care robot, and now I have a chance to do something else.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>For more from this interview with Angle, including his take on whether humanoid robots will ever work, check out TechCrunch’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/76SeToo8Rxj8hRTE0iQwWZ\">StrictlyVC Download</a> podcast — new episodes drop every Tuesday, and the full conversation will be available soon</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Brown officials said they removed the student’s digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast Company <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91463942/sequoia-shaun-maguire-brown-university-shooter-palestine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">republished</a> two of Maguire’s deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete <a href=\"https://x.com/shaunmmaguire/status/2001043856071254339\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">comments</a> he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an <a href=\"https://shaunmaguire.fyi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open letter</a> urging Sequoia to take action. An open letter was later published <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/shaun-maguire-letter-of-support-2025-7\">supporting</a> Maguire.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia’s new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire’s social media activity. Chief Operating Officer Sumaiya Balbale <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e6de299-3eb6-4ba9-8037-266c55c02170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">left the firm</a> in August over Sequoia’s inaction on Maguire’s anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Former managing partner Roelof Botha, who stepped down in November, defended Maguire’s behavior <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/roelof-botha-explains-why-sequoia-supports-shaun-maguire-after-coo-quit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">during an interview</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners’ right to “free speech.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha said, referring to Maguire. He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire’s outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire’s conduct since taking over leadership.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for Maguire’s firing, telling Fast Company that his accusations are “deeply irresponsible and incredibly dangerous.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Sequoia for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/ai-synthetic-research-startup-aaru-raised-a-series-a-at-a-1b-headline-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">become popular</a> for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that Splunk acquired in 2019.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last October, Resolve AI raised a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/greylock-backed-resolve-ai-raises-35-million-seed-funding-help-engineers-2024-10-01/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$35 million seed</a> round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/06/18/traversal-emerges-from-stealth-with-48-million-from-sequoia-and-kleiner-perkins-to-reimagine-site-reliability-in-the-ai-era/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a $48 million Series A</a> led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rivian plans to start selling its more affordable R2 SUV in the first half of 2026. The upcoming R2 is supposed to reach a much wider market than the company’s current R1 SUV and pickup truck and the EV maker has plans to make hundreds of thousands of them per year, including at a new factory in Georgia. Rivian is also looking to expand its automated driving features next year, which it detailed at last week’s inaugural <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/inside-rivians-big-et-on-ai-powered-self-driving/\">Autonomy &amp; AI Day event</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marcario has served on Rivian’s board since January 2021, a role she took after 12 years as an executive (and eventual CEO) of Patagonia. Before her appointment, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe often <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/amazon-invests-rivian-electric-truck-suv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described</a> his aim for the company to become “the Patagonia of EVs.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian said Friday that Marcario will continue her role as chair of the board of trustees overseeing the Rivian Foundation. She serves on that board alongside Scaringe, Rivian’s chief sustainability officer Anisa Kamadoli Costa, and conservationist Ed M. Norton.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Formed just before the company’s blockbuster 2021 IPO, the Rivian Foundation was initially handed 1% of the company’s equity in order to make “the natural world” a “stakeholder in [Rivian’s] success.” The foundation remained quiet for the first few years as Rivian’s stock price fell from its post-IPO highs, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/rivian-foundation-reveals-first-10-million-grantees/\">announced its first $10 million in grants in 2024</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, the Rivian Foundation <a href=\"https://rivianfoundation.org/what-we-fund#our-grantees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has publicized</a> another $2.6 million in awards on its website.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We would like to thank her for her stewardship on the Rivian board over the past 5 years, and look forward to her continued leadership on the Rivian Foundation,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
