However, these agentic capabilities also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bdtechtalks.com/2025/10/27/openai-atlas-browser-prompt-injection/\">come with</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/25/the-glaring-security-risks-with-ai-browser-agents/\">security risks</a> that could lead to loss of data or money. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/google-brings-gemini-in-chrome-to-us-users-unveils-agentic-browsing-capabilities-and-more/\">agentic capabilities on Chrome in September</a> and said these features will roll out in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"A pair of screenshots showing what Chrome's agent model can see from a website.\" class=\"wp-image-3073681\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=1200,648 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=1280,691 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=430,232 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=720,389 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=900,486 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=800,432 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=1536,829 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=668,361 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=1143,617 1143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=708,382 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model. This can prevent navigation to harmful model-generated URLs, the company said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?w=657\" alt=\"A screenshot showing Chrome's agent model asking user permission before paying for an item while shopping.\" class=\"wp-image-3073680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg 1304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=290,300 290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=768,795 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=657,680 657w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=1159,1200 1159w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=1236,1280 1236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=415,430 415w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=695,720 695w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=869,900 869w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=773,800 773w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=645,668 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=362,375 362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=596,617 596w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=513,531 513w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2.jpeg?resize=48,50 48w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The search giant said that it is also handing over the reins to users for sensitive tasks. For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it’ll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent’s model doesn’t have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI browser makers are also paying attention to security. Earlier this month, Perplexity released <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/building-safer-ai-browsers-with-browsesafe\">a new open-source content detection model</a> to prevent prompt injection attacks against agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/openai-and-the-race-for-ai-driven-commerce/\">build apps into ChatGPT</a>. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/target-joins-openais-growing-list-of-retail-apps/\">Target</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/intuit-partnership/\">Intuit</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/openai-and-perplexity-are-launching-ai-shopping-assistants-but-competing-startups-arent-sweating-it/\">OpenAI and Perplexity</a> announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/adobe-predicts-ai-assisted-online-shopping-to-grow-520-during-the-2025-u-s-holiday-season/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-assisted online shopping</a> will grow by 520% this holiday season.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/26/is-openai-profitable-forecast-data-center-200-billion-shortfall-hsbc/\">it may not</a> for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/\">small fee</a>” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI’s debt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In the latter two states, Petco reported <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mass.gov/doc/data-breach-report-2025/download\">one</a> and three affected residents respectively. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company did not disclose the exact number of victims in California, where companies are required to disclose breaches involving at least 500 state residents, which suggests there are more victims than that number in the state. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera did not respond to a series of questions sent on Monday, which included how many customers in total were affected by this incident; whether Petco has any technical means, including logs, to determine whether any cybercriminals had access and stole the customers’ exposed data; what and when was the specific issue identified; and what was the application involved in the incident. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For context, in 2022, Petco <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://corporate.petco.com/2022-08-09-Petco-evolves-organizational-design-to-enable-next-phase-of-growth\">said</a> it served more than 24 million customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera said in a statement to TechCrunch that the company had “provided further information to individuals whose information was involved.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">California’s attorney general <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-615037\">published a sample letter</a> that Petco is sending to its customers. The message said Petco discovered an issue with “a setting within one of our software applications that inadvertently allowed certain files to be accessible online,” that the company “immediately took steps to correct the issue and to remove the files from further online access,” and that it “corrected” the setting and implemented unspecified “additional security measures.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is offering free credit and identity theft monitoring services to victims in California, California, Massachusetts, Montana. Under California law, for example, companies must provide these services if a data breach victim’s driver’s license number or Social Security number are compromised. It’s unclear if Petco is also offering these services to victims in Texas.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company previously raised a $33 million Series A, which it announced in April 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Energy Impact Partners and Galvanize with participation from Alumni Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Incite Ventures, and Lowercarbon Capital. Veery Maxwell at Galvanize will be joining the board, as will former Nest CFO Tom vonReichbauer. (The latter should come as no surprise given that many Quilters used to work at Nest.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding will go toward expanding the company’s footprint. Quilt has installed nearly 1,000 units in 16 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, co-founder and CEO Paul Lambert said in a <a href=\"https://www.quilt.com/news/this-milestone-belongs-to-you-quilt-raises-20m-series-b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">note</a> posted on the company’s website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quilt has been a rare startup challenging entrenched incumbents in the heat pump market. To unseat them, the company has taken a software- and design-first approach. One example is an over-the-air update the company pushed to heat pumps that were already installed; the new software and firmware improved the performance of existing units <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/how-an-over-the-air-update-made-quilts-heat-pumps-more-powerful/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">by more than 20%</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

California, for example, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/california-governor-newsom-signs-landmark-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/\">the AI safety and transparency bill SB 53</a>, while Tennessee’s <a href=\"https://www.lw.com/admin/upload/SiteAttachments/The-ELVIS-Act-Tennessee-Shakes-Up-Its-Right-of-Publicity-Law-and-Takes-On-Generative-AI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ELVIS Act</a> protects musicians and performers from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes of their voices and likenesses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silicon Valley figures, including OpenAI President Greg Brockman and VC-turned-White House “AI czar” David Sacks, have argued that such laws by states would create an unworkable patchwork of laws that would stifle innovation and threaten the U.S.’s lead against China in the race to develop AI technology. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Silicon Valley has a mighty lobbying arm that has blocked meaningful technology regulation for years, and proponents of states’ regulatory rights say there’s no reason to believe state AI laws could “destroy AI progress,” as VCs and tech companies claim. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump’s executive order, a <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26287992/trump-executive-order-on-ai-law-preemption.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">draft</a> of which was leaked a couple of weeks ago, would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” to challenge state AI laws in court, direct agencies to evaluate state laws deemed “onerous,” and push the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission toward national standards that override state rules. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Order would also give Sacks direct influence over AI policy, superseding the usual role of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, currently headed by Michael Kratsios. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Christmas comes early for AI billionaires who keep getting exactly what they want from The White House: a massive handout that makes it that much easier for them to make massive profits for themselves with exactly zero consideration for the risks to our kids, to our safety, and to our jobs,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/a16z-backed-super-pac-is-targeting-alex-bores-sponsor-of-new-yorks-ai-safety-bill-he-says-bring-it-on/\">New York Assembly member Alex Bores</a>, who sponsored New York’s RAISE Act, said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Attempts to block states’ power to regulate AI have been deeply unpopular on both sides of Congress. Earlier this year, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a proposal that would place a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-five-years-heres-what-it-means/\">10-year moratorium</a> on AI legislation into the federal budget bill, but it was rejected 99-1, in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement that tech companies shouldn’t operate without oversight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And when Trump’s draft was leaked last month, several Republican politicians spoke out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1991487762722353228\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted on X</a>: “States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state. Federalism must be preserved.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) <a href=\"https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1996630484512821505\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted</a> late last week: “I oppose stripping Florida of our ability to legislate in the best interest of the people. A ten year AI moratorium bans state regulation of AI, which would prevent FL from enacting important protections for individuals, children and families.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeSantis has also called data centers as drains on power and water resources, as well as potential job killers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,” he said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1990850245832683816\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">November X post</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Late last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) warned Trump against the EO, advising him to “leave AI to the states” to preserve federalism and allow local protections. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The desire to protect people from potential harms of AI technology is not unfounded. There have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">several deaths by suicide</a> following prolonged conversations with AI chatbots, and psychologists have recorded an uptick in cases of a condition they’re calling “AI psychosis.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A bipartisan coalition of<a href=\"https://ncdoj.sharefile.com/share/view/s70df95275fdb4755bf463e6ae62d82c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> over 35 state attorneys general</a> warned Congress last month that overriding state AI laws could have “disastrous consequences,” and more than <a href=\"https://ari.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NDAA-State-Policymaker-Coalition-Letter-11-23-25-Oppose-AI-Preemption.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">200 state lawmakers</a> have issued an open letter opposing federal preemption, citing setbacks to progress on AI safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article has been updated with comment from Alex Bores (D-NY).</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The new space gives creators access to exclusive templates, transitions, and effects, along with the ability to instantly publish Shorts to their YouTube channels directly from their phones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the space is designed to give creators everything they need to produce viral videos, grow their audience, and tap into trends, whether it’s creating day-in-the-life vlogs, travel videos, or behind-the-scenes clips. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By partnering with Adobe, YouTube is giving creators on its platform an exclusive space to create content, encouraging them to use its partners’ space instead of competitors’ tools, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/a-guide-to-using-edits-metas-new-capcut-rival-for-short-form-video-editing/\">Meta’s Edits</a> or CapCut, which is owned by TikTok parent ByteDance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Although content edited in Premiere mobile can be shared to other social platforms, what’s unique about this partnership is that creators getting inspiration from their YouTube Shorts feed, can launch a template that caught their eye, directly into Premiere mobile and start customizing it for their own channel,” said Meagan Keane, director, Product Marketing, Digital Video and Audio at Adobe, in an email to TechCrunch. “This content creation space within the Premiere mobile app is designed and optimized for YouTube Shorts.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073380\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png 2680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=1200,650 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=1280,693 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=430,233 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=720,390 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=900,488 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=800,433 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=1536,832 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=2048,1110 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=668,362 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=1139,617 1139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=708,384 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-05-at-12.32.14-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Adobe</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Create for YouTube Shorts content creation space in Premiere mobile features Shorts templates from top creators with built-in text, effects, and transition presets. Creators can add their own media and customize the templates to their style. They also have the option to create and submit their own original templates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get started, creators need a free Premiere mobile login to access the space and a YouTube profile to publish directly to their Shorts feed. Creators can download Adobe Premiere from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-video-editor/id6742757464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">App Store</a> and tap the “Create for YouTube” option to access the creation space. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From there, they can upload clips from their iPhone camera roll, cloud storage, or Adobe Creative Cloud. They can then cut and trim clips, layer in video and audio tracks, adjust color and brightness, and add text overlays and captions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After following export prompts, creators can upload the finished product to YouTube. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“New tools and capabilities in the app, like templates, effects, transitions, and this new content creation space for YouTube Short creation, will be powerful for all creators, from longtime creators to those just getting started,” Keane said. “It brings creators polished video editing with studio-quality audio, AI sound effects, precision multi-track editing, Firefly AI content generation, and more to make producing and sharing their content easier and faster. This ultimately helps us further our goal of empowering creativity for all. Every day, we’re focused on doing our part to make this the best time ever to be a creator.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073301\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hinge-ConvoStarter2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Hinge</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Convo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/hinge-new-ai-feature-determines-if-your-prompt-response-is-too-basic/\">Prompt Feedback</a> feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-14/gen-z-s-skeptical-of-ai-in-dating-apps-like-tinder-and-hinge-survey-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> Bloomberg Intelligence survey </a>found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million toward AI efforts. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-declares-code-red-combat-threats-chatgpt-delays-ads-effort\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“code red” memo</a> about the competitive threat of Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per <a href=\"https://ramp.com/data/ai-index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ramp AI Index</a>, the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/anthropic-expects-b2b-demand-to-boost-revenue-to-70b-in-2028-report/\">revenue</a> comes mainly from B2B sales — and, increasingly, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/open-source-technology-in-the-age-of-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">open-weight model providers</a> for enterprise customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI giant has committed <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/28/openai-1-trillion-altman?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$1.4 trillion</a> to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That increase in reasoning tokens, which correlates with increased <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/05/ai-reasoning-energy-problem-data-centers-30-times-more-power/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">energy usage</a>, could be expensive for companies and therefore not sustainable in the long term. TechCrunch has asked OpenAI about enterprise budget allocation for AI and the sustainability of this growth rate. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073657\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png 1616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=768,304 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=680,269 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=1200,475 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=1280,507 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=430,170 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=720,285 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=900,356 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=800,317 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=1536,608 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=668,265 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=1440,570 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=708,280 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-productivity-gains.png?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond raw usage metrics, OpenAI is also seeing changes in how companies deploy its tools. Use of custom GPTs — which companies use to codify institutional knowledge into assistants or automate workflows —  jumped 19x this year, now accounting for 20% of enterprise messages, the report found. OpenAI pointed to digital bank customer BBVA, which it says regularly uses over 4,000 custom GPTs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It shows you how much people are really able to take this powerful technology and start to customize it to the things that are useful to them,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, during the briefing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These integrations have led to meaningful time savings, according to OpenAI. Participants reported saving 40 to 60 minutes per day with OpenAI’s enterprise products — though that may not include time spent learning the systems, prompting, or correcting AI output. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The report found that enterprise workers are also increasingly leveraging AI tools to expand their own capabilities. Three quarters of those surveyed say AI enables them to do things, including technical tasks, they couldn’t do before. OpenAI reported a 36% increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research teams. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI drove home the idea that its technology is democratizing access to skills, it’s important to note that more vibe coding could lead to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/wiz-chief-technologist-ami-luttwak-on-how-ai-is-transforming-cyberattacks/\">more security vulnerabilities</a> and other flaws. When asked about this, Lightcap pointed to OpenAI’s recent release of its agentic security researcher <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-aardvark/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Aardvark</a>, which is in private beta, as a potential way to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073656\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png 1606w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=1200,601 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=1280,641 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=430,215 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=720,360 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=900,451 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=800,400 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=1536,769 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=668,334 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=1232,617 1232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=708,354 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai-enterprise-frontier-workers.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The gaps are widest between frontier and median workers for writing, coding, and analysis</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>OpenAI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s report also found that even the most active ChatGPT Enterprise users aren’t using the most advanced tools available to them, like data analysis, reasoning, or search. During the briefing, Lightcap mused that this was because fully adopting AI systems requires a mindset shift and deeper integration with enterprise data and processes. Adoption of advanced features will take time, he said, as companies retool workflows to better understand what’s possible. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightcap and Chatterji also stressed a report finding that showed a “growing divide in AI adoption,” with some “frontier” workers using more tools more often to save more time than the “laggards.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are firms that still very much see these systems as a piece of software, something I can buy and give to my teams and that’s kind of the end of it,” Lightcap said. “And then there are companies that are really starting to embrace it, almost more like an operating system. It’s basically a re-platforming of a lot of the company’s operations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s leadership — which certainly feels the pressure of the firm’s $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments — framed this as an opportunity for laggards to catch up. For workers training AI systems to replicate their work, “catching up” might feel more like a countdown.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As for his feelings about the deal, he said, “Netflix is a great company. They’ve done a phenomenal job. Ted is a fantastic man. I have a lot of respect for him. But it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg also reports that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav was reluctant to sell the company and was surprised when Paramount began to explore an acquisition — if nothing else, he’d expected Ellison to wait until the studio completed a planned split of its movie and streaming businesses from its cable networks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, Warner Bros. said it would consider other bids, leading to a competitive process that Netflix won — although <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\">Paramount</a> could still keep its hat in the ring with a hostile bid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This post has been updated with Trump’s comments.</em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The commission also said X’s advertising repository failed to meet the DSA’s requirements for transparency and accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The commission said that X must respond within 60 days to its concerns about blue checkmarks, and within 90 days to the ad transparency violations, or it could face additional penalties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the fine was announced, X owner Elon Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1997009604681896340\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described it</a> as “bullshit” and also <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1997306328654422478\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted</a>, “How long before the EU is gone?

But should it? </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As autonomous vehicle tech percolates into the cityscape, so has the criticism and challenges. A couple of recent incidents illustrate this point. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <strong>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</strong> has asked Waymo for more information about its self-driving system and operations following reports from the Austin School District that its robotaxis <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/feds-ask-waymo-about-robotaxis-repeatedly-passing-school-buses-in-austin/\">illegally passed school buses</a> 19 times this year. The agency already opened an investigation into Waymo’s performance around school buses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there is KitKat, the bodega cat that died after a Waymo robotaxi ran him over on October 27.

At the moment, users are able to make crypto-to-crypto trades — but speaking at India Blockchain Week (IBW), Coinbase’s APAC director John O’Loghlen said the company will open up a fiat on-ramp in 2026, allowing users in India to load money and buy crypto.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Coinbase opened up its services in India in 2022, and within days had to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/10/coinbase-suspends-upi-payments-in-india-days-after-launch/\">shut down support for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment network</a>. This move came after UPI operator National Payments Corporation (NPCI) <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/07/indian-payments-body-refuses-to-acknowledge-coinbases-india-launch/\">refused to acknowledge Coinbase’s presence in the country</a>. Later in 2023, Coinbase ceased all operations for <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/coinbase-is-stopping-all-services-for-indian-users/articleshow/103558801.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Indian users and asked them to offload their accounts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We had millions of customers in India, historically, and we took a very clear stance to off-board those customers entirely from overseas entities, where they were domiciled and regulated. Because we wanted to kind of burn the boats [sic], have a clean slate here. As a commercial business person wanting to make money and active users, that’s like the worst thing you can do, and so you know it wasn’t without some hesitation,” O’Loghlen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company started engaging with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a government agency that oversees transactions and fraud, and eventually registered with them this year. In October, it started to onboard users through early access, and now the app is open to all users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many internet companies have set up their base in India hoping to tap into the world’s second-largest online user base. While social platforms and AI companies like OpenAI have found rapid growth in the market, it has been hard for crypto companies to follow the same path because of strict regulations and taxation around cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India levies a 30% tax on crypto income without any loss offset and also charges 1% deduction on each transaction, which could discourage users from trading frequently. O’Loghlen said that the company hopes that the government will relax the taxation to make it less burdensome for people to hold digital assets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite these challenges, Coinbase seems to be hopeful about India. The company’s venture arm pumped more money in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/coinbase-boosts-investment-in-indias-coindcx-valuing-exchange-at-2-45b/\">local exchange CoinDCX at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation</a>. It also plans to bolster its 500-plus team in the country by hiring for multiple roles focusing on both local and global markets.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think we want to be known as that trusted exchange, ensure that your funds are safe with us,” O’Loghlen said. “We’re not going to get out to the masses if you can’t have a really nice UI, a trusted experience that allows you to on board in a matter of minutes in the same way that you do with you know Zepto or Flipkart or any other super app in India.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now a general partner at venture firm Playground Global, he’s working with 10 startups. But one portfolio company has captured an outsized share of his attention: <a href=\"https://www.xlight.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">xLight</a>, a semiconductor startup that last Monday <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/what-does-it-mean-when-uncle-sam-is-one-of-your-biggest-shareholders-chip-startup-xlight-is-about-to-find-out/\">announced</a> it has struck a preliminary deal for up to $150 million from the U.S. Commerce Department, with the government set to become a meaningful shareholder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a nice feather in the cap of Gelsinger, who spent 35 years across two stints at Intel before the board showed him the door late last year owing to a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/02/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-is-out.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lack of confidence</a> in his turnaround plans. But the xLight deal is also shining a spotlight on a trend that’s making people in Silicon Valley quietly uncomfortable: the Trump administration taking equity stakes in strategically important companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What the hell happened to free enterprise?” California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/business/dealbook/newsom-kirk-bessent-dealbook-summit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asked</a> at a speaking event this week, capturing the unease that’s rippling through an industry that has long prided itself on its free-market principles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speaking at one of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC events at Playground Global, Gelsinger — who is xLight’s executive chairman — seemed unbothered by the philosophical debate. He’s more focused on his bet that xLight can solve what he sees as the semiconductor industry’s biggest bottleneck: lithography, the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize chip manufacturing. If the technology works at scale, that is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You know, I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said, referencing the decades-old principle that computing power should double every two years. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s law.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The xLight deal is the first Chips and Science Act award under Trump’s second term, using funding earmarked for early-stage companies with promising technologies. Notably, the deal is currently at the letter of intent stage, meaning it’s not finalized and details could still change. When pressed on whether the funding could end up being double the announced amount — or potentially not materialize at all — Gelsinger was candid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’ve agreed in principle on the terms, but like any of these contracts, there’s still work to get done,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"X-Light's Nicholas Kelez and Pat Gelsinger on government-backed chips l StrictlyVC Palo Alto\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bvse20xlcOg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technology xLight is pursuing is pretty serious in both scale and ambition. The company plans to build machines roughly 100 meters by 50 meters — about the size of a football field — that will sit outside semiconductor fabrication plants. These free electron lasers would generate extreme ultraviolet light at wavelengths as precise as 2 nanometers, far more powerful than the 13.5 nanometer wavelengths currently used by ASML, the Dutch giant that utterly dominates the EUV lithography market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“About half of the capital goes into lithography,” Gelsinger explained of the entire semiconductor industry. “In the middle of a lithography machine is light . . . [and] this ability to keep innovating for shorter wavelength, higher power light is the essence of being able to continue to innovate for more advanced semiconductors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Leading xLight is Nicholas Kelez, whose background is unusual for the semiconductor world. Before founding xLight, Kelez led quantum computer development efforts at PsiQuantum (a Playground Global portfolio company) and spent two decades building large-scale X-ray science facilities at national labs including SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley, where he was Chief Engineer for the Linac Coherent Light Source.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So why is this viable now when ASML abandoned a similar approach almost a decade ago? “The difference was the technology wasn’t as mature,” explained Kelez, who was speaking at the event alongside Gelsinger. Back then, only a handful of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines existed, and the industry had already sunk tens of billions into the incumbent technology. “It just wasn’t the time to take on something completely new and orthogonal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, with EUV ubiquitous in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing and existing light source technology hitting its limits, the timing looks better. The key innovation, according to Kelez, is treating light like a utility rather than building it into each machine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We go away from building an integrated light source with the tool, which is what [ASML does] now and that fundamentally constrains you to make it smaller and less powerful,” he said. And instead, “We treat light the same way you treat electrical power or HVAC. We build outside the fab at utility scale and then distribute in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is aiming to produce its first silicon wafers by 2028 and have its first commercial system online by 2029. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073618\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962356997_410c1d019c_c.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Slava Blazer Photography / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are, naturally, hurdles, though right now, competing with ASML directly does not appear to be one of them. In fact, the very opposite is true. “We’re working very closely with them to basically design how we integrate with an ASML scanner,” Kelez said. “So we’re working with both them, as well as their providers, [like] Zeiss, who does their optics.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked whether Intel or other major chipmakers have committed to purchasing xLight’s technology, Gelsinger said they have not: “Nobody has committed yet, but the work is going on with everybody on the list that you would expect, and we’re having intense conversations with all of them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the competitive landscape is heating up. In October, Substrate — a semiconductor manufacturing startup backed by Peter Thiel — announced it raised <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/what-is-substrate-a-thiel-backed-chip-startup-seeking-to-crack-asml-s-dominance?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$100 million</a> to develop U.S. chip fabs, including an EUV tool that sounds awfully similar to xLight’s approach. Gelsinger doesn’t see them as direct competition though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If Substrate is successful, they could be a customer for us,” he said, suggesting that Substrate is focused on building a full-stack lithography scanner that would ultimately need a free electron laser, which is exactly what xLight is developing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gelsinger’s relationship with the Trump administration adds another layer to the story. He brought up xLight to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick back in February, before Lutnick was confirmed. At that point, Kelez says, he’d already spent more than a year pitching xLight to the government as a way to bring chip manufacturing back to the U.S., but the new arrangement has drawn criticism from some who view the administration’s approach as overreach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gelsinger is unapologetic, framing it as necessary for national competitiveness. “I measure it by the results,” he said. “Does it drive the results that we want and that we need to reinvigorate our industrial policies? Many of our competitive countries don’t have such debates. They’re moving forward with the policies that are necessary to accomplish their competitive outcomes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He pointed to energy policy as another example. “How many nuclear reactors are being built in the US today? Zero. How many being built in China today? Thirty-nine. Energy policy in a digital AI economy equals the economic capacity of the nation.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3073619\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54963502374_b5d5400a57_c.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Slava Blazer Photography / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For xLight, the government stake comes with minimal strings attached. The Commerce Department won’t have veto rights or a board seat, says Kelez (pictured above). No information rights, nothing, Gelsinger adds. “It’s a minority investment, in a non-governing way, but it also says we need this company to succeed for national interest.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">xLight has raised $40 million from investors including Playground Global and is planning another fundraising round next month, in January. Unlike fusion or quantum computing startups that need billions, Kelez said xLight’s path is more manageable. “This is not fusion or quantum,” he said. “We don’t need billions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also signed a letter of intent with New York to build its first machine at the New York CREATE site near Albany, though that agreement also needs finalization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Gelsinger, xLight is clearly more than just another portfolio company. It’s a chance to cement his relevance in the semiconductor industry that he helped build, even if his methods put him at odds with Silicon Valley’s traditional ethos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked about navigating his principles in the current political environment, Gelsinger retreated to a more technocratic view of corporate leadership — one where the money is from the U.S. government, administrations are temporary, and CEOs must remain above the fray.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“CEOs and companies should neither be Republican or Democrat,” he said. “Your job is to accomplish the business objective, serve your investors, serve your shareholders. That is your objective. And as a result, you need to be able to figure out what policies are beneficial on the R side or what policies are beneficial in the D side, and be able to navigate through them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added separately of that $150 million from the Trump administration, “Taxpayers will do well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked if working across 10 startups is enough for someone who used to run Intel, Gelsinger was emphatic: “Absolutely. The idea that I can now influence across such a wide range of technologies — I’m a deep tech guy at the core of who I am. My mind is so stretched here, and I’m just grateful that the Playground team would have me to join them and let me make them smarter and be a rookie venture capitalist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He paused, then added with a grin: “And I gave my wife back her weekends.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a nice thought, though anyone who knows Gelsinger’s reputation as a workaholic might wonder how long that arrangement will last.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Paramount was trying to acquire the entire company, while Netflix will only buy the film and television studios, as well as the streaming business, after Warner Bros. moves forward with a plan to spin off its TV networks division.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Initially, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/david-ellisons-paramount-seen-front-runner-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2025-10-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paramount was seen as the frontrunner</a>, with its ties to the Trump administration (the studio is now run by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison) easing the way for regulatory approval. But even before the Netflix deal was announced, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-letter-netflix-comcast-warner-bros-1236442793/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paramount’s lawyers sent an angry letter</a> complaining about “a tilted and unfair process,” and Netflix soon emerged publicly as the winner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, would presumably face <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/12/netflix-warner-bros-trump-regulatory-approval-1236634472/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">significant regulatory scrutiny</a>, and not just from Trump appointees. Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">longtime critic of Big Tech</a> — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-on-netflix-warner-bros-proposed-deal-anti-monopoly-nightmare\">put out a statement of her own</a> describing the deal as “an anti-monopoly nightmare.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A Netflix-Warner Bros. [merger] would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She also argued that antitrust enforcement — including the review process for this deal — must be conducted “fairly and transparently” rather than used to “invite influence-peddling and bribery.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the government ultimately blocks the acquisition, Netflix would be required to pay <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/netflix-s-5-8-billion-breakup-fee-for-warner-among-largest-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a $5.8 billion breakup fee</a>. It’s not clear whether Warner Bros. would then continue operating as an independent company or would reconsider the previous acquisition offers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2025/Dec/05/Netflix-Inc-_M-A-Call_2025-12-05T00_00_00_English.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">held an analyst call</a> to discuss the deal on Friday morning, and while many of the questions were focused on the financial impact on both companies, executives also attempted to address larger concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he’s “highly confident in the regulatory process.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it’s pro-creator, it’s pro-growth,” he said. “And our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarandos also said that Netflix intends to keep HBO “operating largely as it is.” And although it’s not something Netflix has done in the past, Warner Bros. will continue producing TV shows for other networks and streaming services, he said: “We want to keep that successful business operating.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for how HBO and HBO Max would be packaged with or folded into the Netflix app, co-CEO Greg Peters said it’s too early to get into specifics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Needless to say, we think the HBO brand is very powerful for consumers,” Peters said. “We think that the offering could constitute and would constitute a part of our plans and how we structure those for consumers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond general concerns around media consolidation, perhaps the biggest question is to what extent Netflix will support theatrical releases for the combined entity’s films — especially after <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/warner-bros-box-office-historic-streak-conjuring-last-rites-1236510864/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Warner Bros. had a record-setting run of box office success</a> this year, while Netflix’s theatrical releases only last for a couple weeks at best and skip major theatrical chains because of the limited exclusive window. (This was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/17/stranger-things-creators-may-be-leaving-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reportedly the deciding factor when “Stranger Things” creators the Duffer Brothers</a> signed an exclusive deal with Paramount.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For his part, Sarandos said he “wouldn’t look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies or for Warner movies for that matter,” and he noted that Netflix has released 30 movies in theaters this year (though again, usually on fewer screens and for a limited period of time).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, “everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros,” he said. But in the long term, he suggested that “the windows will evolve” so that movies come to streaming more quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don’t really think of that consumer friendly,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
