However, after working with LinkedIn over the past two weeks — and addressing the social network’s concerns — Artisan is now being reinstated. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “Every startup inevitably has some kind of thing that comes back to bite them [from things] that they do early on,” Carmichael-Jack said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Contrary to what the rumors in the viral posts said, LinkedIn did not ban the company because its AI agents were spamming users. LinkedIn did, however, object to the startup using LinkedIn’s name on its website and also alleged that the company was using data brokers who had scraped the site without permission, Carmichael-Jack said. Data scraping is a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#rights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">violation of LinkedIn’s terms of service</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Artisan AI is a graduate of startup accelerator Y Combinator and became one of San Francisco’s buzziest startups via <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its “Stop hiring humans” billboards posted</a> around town. Artisan offers an AI agent it calls Ava that does outbound sales by finding and contacting potential customers. LinkedIn is famously precious turf for outbound marketing salespeople — both human and, increasingly, AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a couple of LinkedIn users seemed to notice <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sidharthrajaram_they-actually-wont-be-coming-into-work-at-activity-7410780466460569601-oQlP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Artisan’s ban about a week ago</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-sdr-artisan-linkedin-ban-debate-what-likely-happened-jakub-mach-dgzwf/?trackingId=llmy04HWQOaxJJ6%2FFPkdgw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posts</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/systemsluke/status/2008887364568178736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tweets</a> about it really picked up steam this week. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Carmichael-Jack explained that LinkedIn’s “enforcement team reached out to us, and they basically restricted our accounts completely, so we disappeared from the platform whilst they were reviewing it, which was not ideal. But it was kind of funny, because once we were restricted, our lead flow suddenly started inching up every day. And I think it’s because, obviously, so many people were posting about it.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a founder who likes a good guerrilla marketing scheme, he joked, “I wish we’d done it on purpose.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The truth was he was shocked to get an email from LinkedIn on Friday evening, December 19, right before the Christmas holiday. Carmichael-Jack described the team handling the ban as helpful and responsive, even if they were also anonymous and only reachable by email. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To appease LinkedIn, Artisan removed all mentions of LinkedIn from its website. It was using the name to compare some of its data features to LinkedIn’s. The CEO also got a crash course in third-party vendor verification, ensuring that his data partners were operating in compliance with LinkedIn’s policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Carmichael-Jack is happy to be back on the Microsoft-owned social network, he downplayed how damaging being booted off would have been, saying very little of the data Artisan uses comes from the site. He’s also about to release a new version of the agent that is more autonomous and can use more channels for contacting prospects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can work around anything. We’re launching dialing as a channel in a few months — outbound calling,” so if the LinkedIn ban could not have been reversed, “it wouldn’t be the end of the world,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, LinkedIn isn’t a direct competitor. It did launch its first AI agent <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/ai/how-we-engineered-linkedins-hiring-assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last year called Hiring Assistant</a>, but it is focused on recruiting. Still, that LinkedIn went nuclear on Artisan could signal that a sales agent could one day be in its pipeline, too. LinkedIn did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In any case, Artisan’s very public banning can be seen as a warning for all agentic players looking for sources of data: Big Tech is watching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Launched last August, the $2.99 per month streaming service offers ad-free access to library content, at a time when rival streamers are raising their prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The opportunity for Howdy was — if you just look at what’s going on in the streaming world with streaming services, they’re getting more expensive. They keep raising prices, and they keep adding larger and larger ad loads,” Wood explained at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES. “And so, the part of the market where it actually started — low-cost and no ads — is gone now. There’s no streaming services that address that portion of the market.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec also suggested that Roku intends to bring Howdy to a broader market than just Roku customers, saying that while it started on Roku, the company “will take it off-platform as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked to clarify offstage if that meant mobile apps, the web, and elsewhere, Wood told TechCrunch the company has not yet said where, specifically, it plans to bring Howdy, but that “we want to distribute it everywhere.”  That seems to suggest that Howdy could be an app that you one day load on any device, large or small. Wood declined to share subscriber numbers with TechCrunch, but said onstage, “I think if I just look at the market, it’s going to be a big streaming service.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won’t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within Health, the AI might reference things you’ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you’re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in <a href=\"https://fidjisimo.substack.com/p/chatgpt-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a> that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the healthcare system has its drawbacks, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/psa-you-shouldnt-upload-your-medical-images-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using AI chatbots for medical advice</a> creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don’t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\">hallucinations</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is “not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Lux was a seed-stage investor in Anduril, which was last valued at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anduril-raises-2-5b-at-30-5b-valuation-led-by-founders-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$30.5 billion</a>, and Applied Intuition, an autonomous vehicle startup that secured contracts with the Pentagon and was valued at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/applied-intuition-raises-600-million-as-it-pushes-further-into-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$15 billion</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lux has also made early bets on AI startups before the industry took off, post-ChatGPT. The firm’s early-stage AI investments include Hugging Face, Runway AI, and MosaicML, the latter of which was acquired by Databricks for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/databricks-picks-up-mosaicml-an-openai-competitor-for-1-3b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.3 billion</a> in 2023.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to being early to the defense tech and AI trends, Lux has realized significant exits from its investment in AI drug discovery company Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which went public in 2021, and the sale of Auris Health, a surgical robotics pioneer that sold to Johnson &amp; Johnson for up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/jj-spends-3-4-billion-in-cash-for-auris-healths-lung-cancer-diagnostics-and-surgical-robots/\">$6 billion</a> in 2019.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest fundraise brings Lux’s assets under management to $7 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

And what better place to make a dark comedy than in that place that develops our society at this point?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The show will also star Sarah Goldberg, Zach Galifianakis, Simon Helberg, and Rob Corddry and will take place in a fictional universe where no real company names are involved, nor will high-profile tech figures make cameos. However, the show may still hit some familiar chords. For instance, Helberg’s character is a maladjusted genius, working on an AI therapy app for teenagers, when he himself is something of a recluse, with a teenage daughter he neglects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s loneliness, I think, at the heart of all the characters, and they’re all trying to connect, and they’re trying to connect through technology, which has some pitfalls,” Helberg says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two new clips from the shows were streamed at the event, but recording was not allowed. In one, an enthusiastic Magnussen pitches Galifianakis when encountering him eating at a restaurant. Galifianakis never responds but cuts him off eventually by stabbing him in the hand with his fork. Another clip showed Helberg completely missing an opportunity to relate to his daughter, and instead using her facial expression of annoyance to train his AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The show premieres Sunday, April 12 on AMC and AMC+. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules at a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper, and the calendar updates with the new events.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080785\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sarah Perez</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also trying to address other pain points for families, such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery.

Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To begin, educators simply go to the Gemini tab within Google Classroom. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. They can then further personalize the audio experience by choosing the number of speakers or selecting different conversational styles, such as interviews, roundtable discussions, or casual dialogues. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new feature is currently available to users subscribed to Google Workspace Education Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing this familiar format into the classroom, teachers can tap into their students’ interests. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.siriusxmmedia.com/insights/growing-up-with-podcasts-the-gen-z-podcast-listener-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">35 million </a>Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. Podcast-style lessons might also encourage independent learning, since students can replay episodes whenever they need a refresher or missed a class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students’ increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google urges teachers to practice responsible AI and carefully review and, if necessary, edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and appropriateness for their specific classroom context and local policies. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini for Classroom first launched in 2024, and Google has continually added new features since then.

Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-nvidia-jetson-thor-the-ultimate-platform-for-physical-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nvidia’s Jetson Thor</a> physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/en/news/caterpillarNews/2022/500-autonomous-trucks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mining sector</a>, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some real momentum on and we felt like we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that it provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/how-a-once-tiny-research-lab-helped-nvidia-become-a-4-trillion-dollar-company/\">the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier</a> for the company and its powerful GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-wants-to-be-the-android-of-generalist-robotics/\">full-stack ecosystem for physical AI</a>, which includes open AI models like the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/nvidia-unveils-new-cosmos-world-models-other-infra-for-physical-applications-of-ai/\">Cosmos model family</a>, simulation tools, and developer kits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-for-the-first-official-day-with-ring-mobileye-siemens-robots-ai-and-more/\">CES coverage here</a>. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a product that will make large installations simpler and cheaper while minimizing the footprint outside the home, and it’s key to the startup’s plans for expansion, which were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/heat-pump-startup-quilt-raises-20m-series-b-to-expand-sales/\">recently turbocharged</a> by a $20 million Series B focused on expanding sales.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the real story is how <a href=\"https://www.quilt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Quilt</a> developed the new product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its founding, Quilt has prided itself on the amount of data it collects from its heat pumps. Not only are they internet-connected, they’re also laced with more sensors than typical heat pumps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By analyzing that data, Quilt engineers have been able to do things that other companies have not. In September, for example, they <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/how-an-over-the-air-update-made-quilts-heat-pumps-more-powerful/\">shipped an over-the-air update</a> to heat pumps in people’s homes that unlocked an additional 20% capacity, which could be directed toward either one or two zones. With the free update, people could be more comfortable during heat waves and cold snaps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team also used the data to develop the new three-zone unit and, in the process, solve a vexing challenge that many competitors face.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like all heat pumps, multi-zone units work best when they’re run at variable speed — that is, when heating or cooling demand is low, the compressor runs at a lower speed to deliver only the amount of heating or cooling that’s needed. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there are limits to how low they can operate. Compressors become less stable at low speeds, making them harder to control. Matthew Knoll, co-founder and CTO at Quilt, compares it to driving a car a low speeds. Maintaining an even 70 mph is easier than a steady 11 mph. “It’s a little harder,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To compensate, most systems stop the compressor at a certain point, sacrificing some efficiency and comfort in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quilt, though, was able to draw on data collected from the thousand or so units already installed in people’s homes and businesses, giving them insights into how the systems were operating in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way most systems are developed, they’re tested in a lab under a couple scenarios because testing’s expensive. And you end up with kind of a you know an average product,” Knoll said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a thousand units out there in many different climates, and if we see something, we can look at it across a bunch of different units to understand if there’s room to optimize or if we’re seeing a problem in a corner case,” he said</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also uses a larger copper coil than many competitors, which allows it to spec a smaller compressor. That combination, along with some other tweaks to the design, allows Quilt to deliver nearly 90% of its rated capacity (27,000 BTUs) at -13˚ F (-25˚ C) without sacrificing low-demand performance or efficiency. Quilt says it’s the most efficient three-zone mini-split on the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To save power, each indoor head can be controlled individually, supplying as little as 2,210 BTUs of heat or 1,570 BTUs of cooling. If heating or cooling isn’t needed, refrigerant still flows through the lines like it does in other heat pumps. But thanks to the outdoor unit’s low-speed performance, it only releases around 300 BTUs of heat in heating mode. That’s about as much heat as a grown adult throws off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Where does Quilt go from here? Knoll wouldn’t comment on future plans other than to say that Quilt “wants to be able to have a solution for all homes.” More products are coming, and it’s likely that reams of data will help lead their development.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Discovery (WBD) and its extensive library of hit TV shows and films like “Harry Potter,” “Game of Thrones,” and the DC Comics titles is dragging on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The studio on Wednesday said its board had unanimously rejected Paramount Skydance’s revised $108.4 billion bid, calling the proposal a “leveraged buyout” that would encumber the company with $87 billion in debt.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a letter to shareholders, WBD urged them to reject the offer, saying the “extraordinary amount” of debt Paramount would need to raise heightens the risk of the deal falling through, and instead recommended they vote in favor of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-in-a-disruptive-deal-valued-at-82-7b/\">earlier, $82.7 billion deal with Netflix</a> for its film and TV studio assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paramount, which was rumored to be in the running to buy WBD before the Netflix deal was announced, went directly to WBD’s shareholders with an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/\">all-cash, $30-per-share offer</a> in early December after Warner Bros.’ board decided to sell to Netflix. But WBD <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-bid-calls-offer-illusory/\">rejected</a> Paramount’s bid, calling the offer “illusory” and saying Paramount did not have the cash to back up its claims, and instead recommended Netflix’s cash-and-share deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paramount then came back with a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/paramount-skydance-netflix-ellison-warner-96bfd981b4595fbd50bf39979b6dbe53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$40 billion guarantee</a> from its CEO David Ellison’s billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and said it would raise $54 billion in debt to fund the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WBD doesn’t seem convinced. “[Paramount] is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization […] This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger,” WBD wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-board-directors-unanimously-recommends-shareholders-reject-amended\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Warner Bros. also called into question Paramount’s ability to function well if the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount’s current “junk” credit rating.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Warner Bros. was particularly concerned about Paramount’s negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by any acquisition. “In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026,” WBD wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-supports-warner-bros-discovery-boards-commitment-to-merger-agreement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">welcomed</a> WBD’s decision, saying after the merger the companies would “bring together highly complementary strengths and a shared passion for storytelling.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These tools are coming to the Spotify for Creators app, and Megaphone, the company’s podcast hosting and monetization suite, in April.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Doubling down on its video strategy in a bid to compete better with YouTube, Spotify is now launching a new API that would let creators use their existing platforms to publish and monetize video podcasts on Spotify. At launch, tools like Acast, Audioboom, Libsyn, Omny, and Podigee have adopted this API, the company said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new moves come as Spotify’s been looking to new avenues to attract users and build on its streaming subscription revenue. The company said since the launch of the partner program, the consumption of video podcasts on the app has nearly doubled, and that the average Spotify podcast user streams twice as many video shows per month as they did before the program was launched. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that could simply be a result of the streaming service surfacing more video content. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also opening a studio for recording podcasts and videos in West Hollywood.

In other words, you don’t have to verify your age to use Roblox, but you do need verification to use chat features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080463\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Leveraging multiple signals, Roblox is constantly evaluating user behavior to determine if someone is significantly older or younger than expected,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “In these situations, Roblox will soon ask users to repeat the age-check process.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chat, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with users in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox says chat is disabled by default for children under 9 unless a parent provides consent following an age check. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The introduction of mandatory age checks comes amid multiple lawsuits, including from the attorneys general of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/07/texas-ag-sues-roblox-accusing-it-of-prioritizing-pixel-pedophiles-over-child-safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Texas</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Louisiana</a>, against Roblox over child safety concerns.

Subramaniyan (pictured above, center) said in an interview. He declined to disclose the size of the initial installment, but said the company expects to close the round in the first quarter of this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Articul8’s valuation for its current funding round marks a roughly fivefold increase from the company’s $100 million post-money Series A valuation in January 2024. Since then, the Santa Clara-based company said it has surpassed $90 million in total contract value — the cumulative value of all signed customer contracts — from 29 paying customers, including Hitachi Energy, AWS, Franklin Templeton, and Intel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subramaniyan told TechCrunch that Articul8 was not under pressure to raise capital, describing the company as revenue-positive following a series of large enterprise contracts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are not cash-strapped,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company expects to finish the year with annual recurring revenue of just over $57 million, Subramaniyan said, with roughly 45% to 50% of that already recognized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Articul8 develops specialized AI systems that operate within customers’ own IT environments, rather than relying on shared, general-purpose models. Instead of selling standalone models, the company packages its technology as software applications and AI agents tailored to specific business functions, targeting regulated industries such as energy, manufacturing, aerospace, financial services, and semiconductors, where accuracy, auditability, and data control are critical.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg\" alt=\"Articul8 knowledge graph\" class=\"wp-image-3080549\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=1200,766 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=1280,817 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=430,275 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=720,460 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=900,575 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=800,511 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=1536,981 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=668,427 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=587,375 587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=966,617 966w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=708,452 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/articul8-knowledge-graph.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Articul8’s knowledge graph view</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Articul8</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our competition is pretty much everybody,” said Subramaniyan. “But today, the major competitors are the cloud service providers, because they have realized that their model, as the general-purpose [offerings], are all commodities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Articul8’s focus on specialized systems appeals to customers who need predictable results and clear audit trails, something that is harder to achieve with general-purpose models run on shared cloud platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Articul8 plans to use the Series B proceeds primarily to expand research and product development and to scale its operations internationally, with a focus on Europe and parts of Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adara Ventures’ participation will help speed-up the European expansion plan, as the European Investment Fund backs the Madrid-based VC firm’s energy fund, Subramaniyan said. The company is also looking to scale in markets including Japan and South Korea, where it has begun working with large enterprise customers, he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s Aditya Birla Ventures also participated in the ongoing round, Subramaniyan stated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Articul8 works with large tech groups including Nvidia and Google Cloud, Subramaniyan said, adding that Amazon Web Services is both a customer and a partner for the company on some deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company employs 75 people, with about 80% focused on R&amp;D, and teams spread across the U.S., Brazil, and India.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sternfels said that while AI models can handle many tasks, sound judgment and creativity remain the essential skills humans must bring to succeed in an AI-infused world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Taneja argued that people must recognize that “skilling and re-skilling” will be a lifelong endeavor. “This idea that we spend 22 years learning and then 40 years working is broken,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calacanis agreed that in a world where it may take less time to build an AI agent than to train a new worker, people must find ways to stay relevant. “To stand out, you’re going to have to show chutzpah, drive, passion,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sternfels provided a glimpse into that future. While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
