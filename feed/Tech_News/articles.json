It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round.

That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/26/style/mark-zuckerberg-prada-milan-fashion-week.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">chatting with his seatmate</a>, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/mark-zuckerbergs-makeover-midlife-crisis-or-carefully-crafted-rebrand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with upgraded threads</a>, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/meta-oakley-prada-smart-glasses-luxottica.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC reported</a> last summer that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/meta-is-reportedly-building-ai-smart-glasses-with-prada-too/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Prada AI glasses were in the works</a>, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/ray-ban-maker-essilorluxottica-triples-sales-of-meta-ai-glasses.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025</a>, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/meta-unveils-its-oakley-smart-glasses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Oakley Meta</a> glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next <a href=\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/prada-group-essilorluxottica-ten-years-licensing-renewal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ten years</a>. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1r2mbjs/why_are_people_disconnecting_or_destroying_their/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rip out</a> their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/14/doorbell-cameras-ring-nancy-guthrie-super-bowl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ring doorbells</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/americans-are-destroying-flock-surveillance-cameras/\">smash Flock cameras</a>. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/meta-plans-to-add-facial-recognition-to-its-smart-glasses-report-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">add facial-recognition</a> features to its glasses, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/meta-facial-recognition-smart-glasses.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The New York Times</a> recently reported.

The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/space-based-solar-power-startup-aetherflux-enters-orbital-data-center-race/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">similar realization</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If you don’t follow each other, the message is filtered through the “Message Requests” folder to prevent spam. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the new shortcut removes the need to navigate to a person’s profile to start a DM conversation with them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Threads was late to introduce a native <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/threads-gets-its-own-dms-as-app-distances-itself-from-instagram/\">DM feature</a>, this latest move indicates that the social network is looking to make messaging a more central part of its platform, as it’s working to reduce the number of steps it takes to start a conversation. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?w=544\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097494\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg 1424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=960,1200 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=1024,1280 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=344,430 344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=576,720 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=720,900 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=640,800 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=534,668 534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=300,375 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=494,617 494w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=425,531 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/639537572_17948432499102532_8622465278203875095_n.jpg?resize=40,50 40w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Threads</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature is rolling out to select users in the U.S. and Canada.

Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ada can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada, can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Meet Ada: Your Digital Twin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIeqR_VpeH8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Read AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (model context protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097385\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Read-AI-Ada-Capabilities.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Read AI</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that while Ada currently works via email, it will soon be available on Slack and Teams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar earlier this month, Shim told TechCrunch that the company now has over 5 million monthly active users and plans to grow that number to 10 million. He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, which has raised over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/read-ai-raises-50m-to-integrate-its-bot-with-slack-email-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$81 million in funding</a>, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched <a href=\"https://www.read.ai/post/read-ai-launches-search-copilot-an-industry-first-ai-tool-for-cross-platform-search-and-discovery--at-no-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Search Copilot</a> for knowledge discovery for users, and last month it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based <a href=\"https://www.read.ai/post/search-copilot-actions-building-workflows-that-work-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on internal and web knowledge</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/ai-note-taking-app-granola-adds-a-repeatable-prompts-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts</a> to surface knowledge from meeting data. <a href=\"https://www.quillmeetings.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Quill</a>, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend 10 years ago, but it’s still new information to many users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/tinder-looks-to-ai-to-help-fight-swipe-fatigue-and-dating-app-burnout/\">Chemistry</a>, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/facebook-is-asking-to-use-meta-ai-on-photos-in-your-camera-roll-you-havent-yet-shared/\">asks to use its AI on photos in your camera roll</a> that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/well/dating-irl-analog-online.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">real-world experiences</a> that are not intermediated by an app.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The retailer was accused of misleading drivers about their potential base pay and tip amounts, and then deceived customers by saying that 100% of tips went to the drivers, when they did not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its original <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/WalmartSparkDriverComplaint.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complaint</a>, the FTC was joined by Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that Walmart, since 2021, had made false representations about Spark Driver earnings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among these, Walmart was accused of frequently splitting a customer’s order between drivers, which would lead to splitting the tip. Meanwhile, customers were told their driver — as in one single driver — would get the full tip. In batch orders, Walmart would remove tips from some of the orders without informing the driver. Walmart also promised tips to drivers in advance of taking orders, but then failed to collect a tip from the customer, leaving the driver without a tip entirely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other issues had to do with reductions Walmart made to drivers’ base pay after they had accepted an offer or other misrepresented incentives that could have provided drivers with extra cash. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Walmart also told customers that drivers would get 100% of their tips, but that wasn’t always true. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit alleged that these practices caused drivers to lose millions of dollars they were promised and generated thousands of consumer complaints. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a result of the settlement, Walmart will have to implement an earnings verification program to ensure drivers are paid the promised earnings and tips. It’s also prohibited from adjusting the base pay, incentives, or tips after the initial offer, except if the driver fails to provide the service or a customer cancels. Walmart has been banned from misrepresenting earnings in future driver offers as well.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Labor markets cannot function efficiently without truthful and non-misleading information about earnings and other material terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement about the settlement agreement. “Today’s settlement reflects the Trump-Vance FTC’s focus on ensuring a healthy labor market for American workers, which is critical to the nation’s success.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/\">$100 million previously announced</a> crossover financing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses, though they say they may seek additional capital before closing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers, including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/\">public via a SPAC merger</a> valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/techcrunch-mobility-self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-goes-public-and-a-shake-up-at-hyundais-supernal/\">SPAC road</a> to the public market in 2025.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Some of the affected organizations are said to be critical infrastructure. The company did not provide specifics, but “critical infrastructure” can refer to everything from power grids and water supply to the transportation sector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several governments, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, warned in <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2026/Feb/25/2003880301/-1/-1/0/CSA_Exploitation_of_SD-WAN_Appliances.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an alert</a> that threat actors are targeting organizations “globally.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all civilian federal agencies to patch their systems by end-of-day Friday, citing an <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-26-03-mitigate-vulnerabilities-cisco-sd-wan-systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">imminent threat</a> and unacceptable risk to the federal government.

All told, the project has over 50 donors so far. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The nonprofit, which just achieved formal 501(c)(3) status, has currently raised more than $750,000 in commitments. But if things go according to the plan of its founder, <a href=\"https://kvinogradov.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Konstantin Vinogradov</a>, it will have $100 million in assets within seven years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov is a venture investor specializing in open source, AI, and infrastructure software, and was previously a general partner at Runa Capital. As such, he has “some experience with university endowments,” which are some of the largest investors in venture capital funds, he told TechCrunch.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vinogradov says as he scoured the world for open source projects, one complaint kept popping up: “There is no source of sustainable funding for open source maintainers. And that’s a really big problem.” (“Maintainer” refers to the developers who work on open source projects, such as debugging, choosing and verifying features submitted by the community, or programming new features themselves.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The endowment will support projects based on criteria such as its number of users, or how many other projects rely on that specific software to operate. It will also choose projects that are not already well-supported by grants, donations, or umbrella organizations such as Linux’s Alpha-Omega. Vinogradov has already assembled a board for the nonprofit.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cash-strapped-burned-out\">Cash strapped, burned out</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lack of money in open source is hardly new. Open source software is typically given away, and since the community often contributes time and efforts freely, up to 86% of open source developers <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/news/open-source-developers-are-exhausted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">are not paid for their work.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t much of a problem for hobbyists or for professional developers paid by their companies to maintain projects, but such a system stands on shaky ground. Open source software is the bedrock upon which the internet stands, and virtually every large company uses open source tools in some way. In fact, open source software accounts for <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/world-of-open-source-global-2025?hsLang=en&amp;_gl=1*3pooru*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjUzMTQ0MDA1LjE3NzE5NjEyMDM.*_ga_BKD8K5CRV0*czE3NzE5NjEyMDIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NzE5NjEyMDIkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_FBYHX832ZD*czE3NzE5NjEyMDIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NzE5NjEyMDIkajYwJGwwJGgw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">up to 55% of the tech stack in organizations</a>, and is present in everything from databases to operating systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While it is certainly possible for open source developers to commercialize their free projects <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/databricks-perplexity-co-founder-pledges-100m-on-new-fund-for-ai-researchers/\">to gain wealth beyond their wildest dreams</a>, the odds, to misquote the Hunger Games, are not in their favor.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is, and has been for decades, a core of developers who volunteer their time and efforts for free to manage popular, important, and critical projects. And many of them are <a href=\"https://opensourcepledge.com/blog/burnout-in-open-source-a-structural-problem-we-can-fix-together/?ref=itsfoss.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">burned out.</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This issue came into the public’s consciousness briefly in 2014, with the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/massive-security-bug-in-openssl-could-effect-a-huge-chunk-of-the-internet/\">OpenSSL Heartbleed disaster,</a> where a bug was found in an open source security project, used by most of the internet, that was maintained by a single developer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been many attempts to fix the funding situation over the years. Some projects take donations from corporate sponsors. For instance, The Linux Foundation, which brought in about <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Foundation-2025-Report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$300 million last year</a> largely from corporate sponsors, doles out grants to select projects through its Alpha-Omega Project. In 2025, Alpha-Omega issued $5.8 million to 14 projects, it said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some projects take donations directly from corporate donors. In January, for instance, Anthropic donated <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/anthropic-has-made-a-large-contribution-to-the-python-software-foundation-and-open-source-security/105694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$1.5 million to the Python Software Foundation</a>. While the Foundation said it was thrilled to have that cash, Anthropic <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/with-ai-investor-loyalty-is-almost-dead-at-least-a-dozen-openai-vcs-now-also-back-anthropic/\">itself raised $30 billion this month</a>. Such a donation is couch-change to the AI lab. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, not every developer wants to take corporate donations, as there are worries of granting too much influence to donor companies. For instance, there was a big hubbub last year in the Ruby community surrounding some long-time maintainers leaving and its big sponsor Spotify, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/open_source_to_closed_doors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Register reported.</a>  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Open Source Endowment hopes to support projects while displacing such risks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The only way to support open source sustainably is private funds,” says Vinogradov. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why hasn’t an endowment been tried before? Endowments require patience, Vinogradov says. They invest many of their assets, spending only a fraction of their income in any given year, and require years or even decades to grow to a meaningful size.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if done right, that patience will result in an independent fund that could support critical open source projects forever.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/xs-ad-business-improved-under-departing-ceo-linda-yaccarino-but-its-still-tough-times-ahead/\">ad sales improved</a> under former CEO Linda Yaccarino, its 2025 revenues <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">were still lower</a> than they were prior to Musk’s acquisition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/x-ad-revenue-forecast-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eMarketer’s</a> forecast last May, X’s ad business was expected to start revitalizing sometime last year, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-12/musk-s-x-posts-higher-sales-amid-costly-turnaround\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> confirmed, but would remain half the size it was before the sale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X says the new aspect ratios now being supported include 4:5 (1440 x 1800 pixels) and 2:3 (1080 × 1620 pixels). The company already supports other formats, including 1:1 (1080 × 1080 pixels), 16:9 (1920 × 1080 pixels), 9:16 (1080 × 1920 pixels), and 1.91:1 (2064 × 1080 pixels).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re committed to empowering advertisers to hit their performance goals with greater ease and impact,” said Monique Pintarelli, head of global advertising at xAI, in a statement.

Developers invest countless hours, months, or even years creating games just to surrender a significant portion — up to 30% — of their earnings to major players like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/y-combinator-says-apples-app-store-has-hindered-startup-growth/\">Apple</a> and Google. However, a newcomer has entered the scene, aiming to revolutionize this model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meet <a href=\"https://about.jest.com/.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jest</a>, a marketplace for messaging games that recently emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding. Jest believes that the future of mobile gaming distribution won’t come from an app store, but rather from within the messaging app. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments. <br><br>With RCS adoption growing, the landscape is shifting. In 2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/apple-finally-adds-support-for-rcs-in-latest-ios-18-beta/\">Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18</a>, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-announces-1b-rcs-messages-sent-in-the-u-s-daily/\">according to Google</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097049\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=430,229 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=720,383 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=900,479 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=800,425 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=668,355 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=1161,617 1161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=708,376 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sms-rcs.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jest</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This convenience is particularly impactful as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/app-downloads-declined-again-in-2025-but-consumer-spending-soared-to-nearly-156b/\">consumers are downloading fewer games</a>. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform had already achieved two significant milestones: more than 1 million messaging games played and over 300,000 messages exchanged. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing 3-4 times better retention than traditional mobile apps. That’s a fundamental shift in the engagement curve. On the user acquisition front, we’ve completely validated that people will sign up and play games through messaging, with our early partners reporting 30-60% lower acquisition costs compared to mobile apps. It’s remarkably simple. Just tap on a link, and you’re in,” Vitanov shared with us. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3097048\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=680,546 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=430,345 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=720,578 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=900,723 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=800,643 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=668,537 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=467,375 467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=661,531 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jest-play-signup.png?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jest</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, what’s most appealing about Jest’s marketplace is the revenue model for developers: an impressive 90/10 split, with 90% of earnings going directly to them. This stands in contrast to the typical 30% commission taken by traditional app stores, offering a promising new avenue for gaming studios.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s also a clever network effect built in. If one studio acquires a user but another studio monetizes them, we split the economics: 70% to the monetizing studio, 20% to the acquiring studio, and 10% to Jest. This creates powerful incentives where even viral games that don’t monetize well can generate revenue streams for their developers when those users play other games on the platform,” Vitanov added. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Jest has already attracted interest from several development partners, including teams behind popular titles such as “Episode,” “Puppy Mansion,” and “Kingdom Maker.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The seed funding, led by Innovation Endeavors, will go toward scaling the platform and onboarding the first group of gaming studios. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To further accelerate growth, Jest has also launched a dedicated Games Fund to support studios at every stage of franchise development on the platform.  This fund will deploy capital across three tiers: $1 million for flagship titles, $200,000 for promising mid-stage titles, and $40,000 for exploratory projects and experimental concepts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, Jest is live in the U.S. and is set to expand to 14 additional countries by the third quarter of 2026.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move comes a week after the design company <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/figma-anthropic-ai-code-designs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">struck</a> a similar partnership with Anthropic to integrate Claude Code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This integration lets users start working with a design in Figma or code in Codex, and move between the two platforms easily using Figma’s MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, users could bring details from Figma design files, Figma Make, or FigJam into Codex for code-based implementation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With this integration, teams can build on their best ideas — not just their first idea — by combining the best of code with the creativity, collaboration, and craft that comes with Figma’s infinite canvas,” Loredana Crisan, Figma’s chief design officer, said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The integration makes Codex powerful for a much broader range of builders and businesses because it doesn’t assume you’re ‘a designer’ or ‘an engineer’ first. Engineers can iterate visually without leaving their flow, and designers can work closer to real implementation without becoming full-time coders,” Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI first launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/\">Codex as a command-line coding assistant</a> last year to compete with Anthropic’s much lauded Claude Code. Later, the company built <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/16/openai-launches-codex-an-ai-coding-agent-in-chatgpt/\">the coding tool into ChatGPT</a>, and earlier this month launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/openai-launches-new-macos-app-for-agentic-coding/\">a dedicated MacOS app for Codex</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The MacOS app was downloaded <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019219967250669741?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a million times within the first week</a> of release.
