For the first time this year, podcasts eclipsed spoken word radio with 40% of listening time, as opposed to 39% for radio.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If anything, it’s surprising that it’s taken this long for podcasts to overtake radio shows. (Remember, this doesn’t include listening to music on the radio). But perhaps that speaks more to the durability of good, old-fashioned radio than the merits of podcasting.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096431\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Edison Research</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We checked with Edison to see if these statistics include video podcasts, and they do. But the need to clarify that question points to the undeniable growing prevalence of video podcasts, hosted on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, which marks another key trend in podcasting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps an industry bellwether, Netflix is inking deals with iHeartMedia and Barstool Sports to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-is-betting-on-podcasts-to-become-the-new-daytime-talk-show/\">bring podcasts to the streaming service</a> as a more trendy version of the daytime talk show. It’s not a bad investment — according to YouTube, people watch them on TV. YouTube said that viewers watched <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcasts-living-room-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">700 million hours</a> of podcasts each month in 2025 on living room devices, like TVs, up from 400 million the previous year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the popularity of video podcasts doesn’t seem to be detracting from audio-first podcast listening. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Triton Digital’s <a href=\"https://podnews.net/press-release/triton-podcast-report-us-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.S. Podcast Report for 2025</a> showed that 80% of consumers over 18 years of age tune into both audio and video podcasts; 13% only listen to audio, while 7% only watch video. Listener preferences also appear to vary greatly depending on a podcast’s genre, with podcasts about topics like music, sports, comedy, and news skewing more popular on video. Genres like science, history, arts, fiction, and true crime are more often consumed via audio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Edison’s findings show a similar trend in the role of video in podcasting. Eighty-five percent of weekly U.S. podcast listeners above the age of 13 consume podcasts with any sort of video component, up 7% from 2023. The research also showed that there are an estimated 115 million weekly podcast listeners in the U.S., with only 5% of listeners reporting that they watch podcasts, but don’t listen to them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Just last month, Harbinger announced it would start selling its battery packs for energy storage and auxiliary power, with Airstream <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/harbinger-launches-harbinger-industria-announces-140000455.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">as the first customer</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger announced Wednesday it has already lined up a customer for Phantom’s advanced driver assistance tech that it just acquired. German automotive technology giant ZF Group has agreed to license that tech from Harbinger, and plans to sell it to automakers for use in their passenger cars. (Terms of the two deals were not disclosed.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger co-founder and CEO John Harris told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview that he expects this new software services business line to generate “millions” of dollars in revenue this year, which he said is mostly “not material” compared to the amount the company will make from selling its truck chassis. The startup recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/harbinger-raises-160m-will-build-trucks-for-fedex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $160 million</a> in a funding round co-led by FedEx and THOR Industries, both of which are customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harris instead expects the ZF Group deal will bring in more significant revenue in 2027 or 2028. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The passenger car market is slower, but the volumes are very, very large,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger was already using Phantom AI’s driver assistance tech, Harris said, and the acquisition will see the companies deepen that integration. Harris expects that to be a big win for Harbinger’s own customers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Medium-duty [trucking] has a complete lack of safety features,” he said. “The majority of medium-duty vehicles on the road that have no backup cameras, no air conditioning, no lane keeping, no automatic emergency braking. It’s just not a thing that exists in the market yet, which is crazy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harbinger already promises a lower total cost of ownership for commercial customers, better emissions compliance, and an easier truck to drive thanks to the simpler, quieter electric powertrain. But Harris thinks the safety features enabled by Phantom’s tech will make Harbinger’s chassis that much better — especially because of how and where they tend to be used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These vehicles, many of them are spending their time navigating around truck ports and pulling in and out of neighborhoods to deliver packages. They’re all in places where there’s a very high safety risk of backing into vehicles, hitting pedestrians, hitting bicyclists, hitting children,” he said. “We need to have, maybe not the cutting edge 2026 safety features, but we should at least have the safety features that were commodity in 2020 or 2015.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Harbinger’s headquarters are in Los Angeles, California, Phantom AI’s 30 employees — including its leadership team — will remain in Mountain View. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This update gives users of the company’s project management software Jira the ability to assign and manage work for their digital agents from the same dashboard they use for their human employees.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents in Jira allows enterprises to assign tasks and tickets to AI agents, just as they would to people. It also tracks how the work is coming along, and sets deadlines, among other metrics. Users can now also loop in AI agents during the middle of an existing project too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This feature is now available in open beta.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This update is meant to give users the same visibility into the work their agents are doing as their human employees Tamar Yehoshua, Atlassian’s new chief product and AI officer, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Atlassian has been in the business, for decades, of collaboration software helping people get work done,” Yehoshua said. “Now, you enter agents, and agents are now doing a lot of that work, and so you want to be able to coordinate between humans and agents.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Atlassian understands that just giving people more avenues to automate doesn’t necessarily mean less work, Yehoshua said. That’s why the key part of this update is that everything happens within the same dashboard, she said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’ve been hearing in the zeitgeist lately that all of these agents are creating more work for people, and in some ways, more chaos,” Yehoshua said. “What we’re really good at is putting order to that chaos.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As enterprises continue to figure out how and where they can find a return on investment from investing in AI tools, this kind of view could prove beneficial. The ability to compare the work of agents versus humans on the same project could help enterprises figure out where to deploy agents to begin with and what tasks should remain human-led.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This announcement is just the first of many, Yehoshua said, as the company looks to increasingly add AI tools into its existing software products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The goal is to enable people to work more productively with AI and I think this is a step,” Yehoshua said. “It’s only the beginning of the journey. It’s a long journey, but this is a really important step of how to integrate AI into the workflows that you already have, which I’m really excited about.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He spoke openly to TechCrunch about the collapse of that company, saying he never figured out how to make it profitable.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My ego made it hard to accept the failure,” he told TechCrunch. “In hindsight, I should have shut it down a year earlier.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For his next company, he went back to his roots. His family owned an insurance brokerage, and he remembered all the hassles that came when founders like himself walked through the doors, trying to insure their businesses. “I hated insurance,” he continued, “swore I’d never end up in it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But then he had an idea. At first, he and Tushar Nair, a longtime friend and former CTO of Poolit, thought about building AI tools for existing brokerages. Then, they decided to just use that technology to build an AI-native insurance brokerage and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.harperinsure.com/\">call it Harper,</a> after Rice’s mother’s maiden name. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in 2024, Harper is part of a trend YC recently wrote about (Harper took part in the YC W’25 batch). The YC <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs\">blog wrote that the </a>future of agencies “will look more like software companies, with software margins.” That’s exactly what Harper is — an almost fully autonomous licensed commercial insurance agency. It matches small- to mid-sized businesses with more than 160 insurance carriers to assist with workers’ compensation, as well as general and professional liability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“What often takes a traditional broker five to seven days, we can often do in one to two,” Rice, the company’s CEO, said. He said a typical sales team at a human-led brokerage handles 20 to 30 deals a month, but AI enables Harper to handle more than 1,000 customers a month. Harper has more than 5,000 customers to date, he continued. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI handles the operational weight. Submission routing, underwriter follow-ups, document collection, pipeline management,” Rice continued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors in the company include YC and Peak XV Partners, and its seed and Series A rounds were led by Emergence Capital. Harper has raised $54 million in funding to date, nabbing that amount in just under two months, Rice said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rice thinks of nearly all brokerages as Harper’s competition. He said that work remains very fragmented, with big players and everyone else running on “email and spreadsheets.” There are, of course, other AI-native brokerages in this space, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gydehealth.ai/\">like Gyde</a>, as well as companies that use AI tools, like FurtherAI or Vantel (both of which are also YC alums). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rice said what makes Harper different is that it hopes to target middle America. “The real-world businesses,” he said, “like daycares, manufacturers, car dealerships, local bars and restaurants.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh funding will be used to build out Harper’s engineering team and help grow the brand. The second time in the game, he has big dreams for this company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to become the voice for entrepreneurs, starting with their insurance, but over time becoming a focal point for all types of things related to risk, compliance, and their entire back office,” he said. “We want to make it simple for them to do their core work, and we basically do everything else over time.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Wednesday, the company launched three new Alexa+ personality styles — Brief, Chill, and Sweet — that will change the AI assistant’s tone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Brief style, Alexa will respond with shorter, direct responses, while the Chill style will see Alexa answer more like a laid-back friend.

In a few cases, it even exacerbated the user’s existing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">mental health issues, leading to crises</a> or even suicides, multiple lawsuits have alleged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, chatbot users have shown a preference for controlling how their AI responds, even writing <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1m16j8c/what_custom_instruction_do_you_all_use_to_change/\">custom</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40474716\">instructions</a> to dictate the AI’s personality. To address this need, OpenAI launched new ChatGPT features in December that allow users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/openai-allows-users-to-directly-adjust-chatgpts-warmth-and-enthusiasm/\">adjust the AI’s base style and tone</a> in terms of its warmth, enthusiasm and use of emoji, among other things. Despite this, some users are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2025723480596255075?s=20\">complaining</a> that the latest model is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1rb0go3/chatgpt_crossed_the_line/\">too reassuring</a> by default.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon says its new styles for Alexa have been built on five dimensions that contribute to its personality: expressiveness, emotional openness, formality, directness, and humor. Each style represents specific levels of all five factors. For instance, Brief isn’t just concise, it’s also casual, direct, and uses minimal humor, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To change Alexa’s style, you can either speak to the AI assistant via a device, like an Echo speaker, or access the feature in the Alexa app’s Device Settings under “Personality Style.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that these three styles are only the first to ship, and others will be on the way in the future. At present, the styles are only available in the U.S. market. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

With Quick Cut, users can describe what they want the video to be in natural language, and the tool will automatically edit out irrelevant parts of the footage, and put together the different takes while using appropriate footage to make transitions between cuts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users can also pick frames from the B-roll and use one of the video models available within Firefly to create short transitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can use the prompt box within the Firefly video editor to specify settings like aspect ratio and pacing between transitions, or add optional B-roll footage. Users can apply Quick Cut to the entire project, a particular timeline, or selected clips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe stressed that the aim of Quick Cut is to deliver a first draft, so editors will still need to adjust elements, paste takes together, and work on transitions to put together the video.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we talk to our users, who are creators and marketers, the biggest problem they actually communicate is the need for fast turnaround, the need for time-saving techniques that just let them get to their creative vision as fast as possible,” Mike Folgner, product lead for AI and next-generation video tools, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One thing we do know is that some of the mundane parts that come with video [editing], like just getting the selects in order, that’s not really where they find joy and difference. They find joy in putting their spin on it. So Quick Cut is meant to help creators who have a set of media find the story very quickly and just get to a story cut as fast as possible,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe has been pushing regular updates to its video-related tools. In December, it rolled out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/adobe-firefly-image-5-brings-support-for-layers-will-let-creators-make-custom-models/\">a new timeline-based video editor</a> that brought layers and prompt-based editing — the editor treats different objects as layers and allows you to edit them using prompts, or use tools like resize and rotate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also added <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/adobe-firefly-now-supports-prompt-based-video-editing-adds-more-third-party-models/\">prompt-based editing capabilities</a> to Firefly, letting users tell the video model how to edit video elements, colors, and camera angles, as well as a timeline view that lets you adjust frames, sounds, and other characteristics easily.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Investing was exciting, but Gerlach was yearning to get back into entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While at Cornell, Gerlach (pictured above, right) built and sold a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cornellsun.com/article/2019/03/student-startup-partners-with-cornell-dining-to-deliver-breakfast-to-your-doorstep\">food delivery startup</a> alongside classmate Pedro Bobrow (pictured above, left), a Brazilian native. Then in late 2022, Gerlach and Bobrow (previously a product manager at Lyft) teamed up again, merging their sector expertise and cultural roots to launch Comp, an HR tech startup focused on Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Comp is building AI-powered HR software that can assist with tasks like recruiting, setting compensation policies and designing performance review systems. The startup also provides “forward-deployed” experts — former HR executives — who work with customers to design strategies for compensation, performance, and recruiting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While companies in Brazil often hire compensation consultants, Gerlach says its forward-deployed HR executives shouldn’t be viewed as consultants, but rather as extensions of existing HR teams. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These executives also play a critical role in refining Comp’s technology. “Our forward-deployed HR execs do all the work manually at first, and then they use that work to train the AI how to think in best practices,” Gerlach said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea, of course, is that over time, Comp’s AI agents will become fully autonomous and capable of performing traditional HR functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Comp currently offers AI-supported HR services augmented by professionals, its goal is to displace both traditional consultancies and HR software. As Gerlach puts it: “Rippling sells software to junior HR teams to make them more productive. We become the HR team.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To that end, Comp this week raised a $17.25 million Series A round led by Khosla Ventures, marking the VC firm’s first-ever investment in a Brazilian company. Khosla general partner Keith Rabois has joined Comp’s board of directors as part of the deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Comp is positioning itself as an AI alternative to traditional compensation consultancies like Mercer, Korn Ferry, and Willis Towers Watson. It also competes with global HR platforms such as Rippling and Workday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gerlach says Comp launched in Brazil because many companies in the country lack traditional HR software, which has allowed the startup to introduce a new, automated model rather than competing with established platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The business model seems to have already gaining traction in Brazil: its clients include Nubank, QuintoAndar, Creditas, and “pretty much every unicorn in Brazil,” Gerlach said. The startup is now eyeing an expansion into the U.S. and other countries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other investors in Comp’s Series A included existing backers Kaszek and Canary, as well as new investors Abstract Ventures and Endeavor Catalyst.<br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

India accounted for about 19% of the global user base of leading AI assistant apps in 2025, ahead of the U.S. at 10%, Sensor Tower said. ChatGPT continues to dominate the Indian market by monthly active users, though rivals including Google’s Gemini and Perplexity have also seen rapid growth following promotional offers. ChatGPT was the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/indias-app-downloads-rebounded-to-25-5-billion-in-2025-fueled-by-ai-assistants-and-microdrama-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most downloaded GenAI app</a> in India and globally in 2025, according to earlier Sensor Tower data. Earlier this month, OpenAI’s CEO said that the chatbot now has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more than 100 million weekly active users</a> in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The promotional push in India reflects a broader strategy by AI firms to reduce pricing friction in a highly value-conscious market, betting that early user adoption and engagement will translate into stronger long-term retention once free access periods expire, said Sneha Pandey, insights analyst at Sensor Tower.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s appeal lies in its massive digital base. The country has more than a billion internet users and around 700 million smartphone owners, making it one of the largest potential markets for AI services globally and a critical battleground for user growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, user engagement in India still trails more mature markets. In 2025, users of leading AI chatbot apps in the U.S. spent about 21% more time per week on the apps than their counterparts in India and logged 17% more sessions on average, per Sensor Tower.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI in-app revenues will likely see meaningful but gradual improvement as users become more deeply integrated into these platforms, making sustained engagement paramount,” Pandey told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She added that pricing pressure in India is likely to remain elevated given the country’s young and value-conscious user base, making lower-cost tiers, telecom bundles, and micro-transaction models important for long-term retention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT remained the clear market leader in India entering 2026, with 180 million monthly active users in January, per Sensor Tower, followed by Google’s Gemini with 118 million, Perplexity with 19 million, and Meta AI with 12 million. The figures underline both the scale of India’s AI opportunity and the growing challenge for firms to convert rapid user adoption into sustained revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity did not respond to requests for comments.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The funding round illustrates the eagerness among Big Tech, legacy automakers, and the investor community to profit from the burgeoning automated driving industry. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wayve provides what founder and CEO Alex Kendall calls the “contrarian” option in automated driving — contrarian both in its approach to tech and its business model, he told TechCrunch in an interview Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the technology chessboard is set around where different companies have invested on the technology strategy, and now the commercial chessboard is being arranged,” Kendall said. “We took a very contrarian view on the technology side. We were the first to build end-to-end deep learning for autonomous driving, and we pioneered this approach. Now, when it comes to this phase of moving into commercialization, we’re also taking a contrarian business model approach.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://wayve.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wayve</a>, which launched in 2017, uses a self-learning approach to its software. The company developed a software layer using an end-to-end neural network that doesn’t require high-definition maps and only uses data to teach the vehicle how to drive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This data-driven learning approach underpins two products: an “eyes on” assisted-driving system and an “eyes off” fully automated-driving system that could be applied to robotaxis or consumer vehicles that can handle all of the driving in certain environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s pitch to customers is the agnostic nature of its technology, which is not reliant on specific sensors or maps. The automated-driving software captures data from whatever sensors are on the vehicle and directs the system’s driving decisions. Wayve’s software can also run on whatever chip its OEM partners already have in their vehicles.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It should be noted, however, that Nvidia, which is also a backer, has had a close development relationship with Wayve since 2018. The startup’s Gen 3 platform, which was unveiled last fall, uses an in-vehicle compute autonomous vehicle development kit called Nvidia Drive AGX Thor. The Gen 3 platform will allow Wayve to offer eyes-off advanced driving-assistance systems and Level 4 — or fully driverless — features that will work on city streets and highways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s tech is somewhat similar to how Tesla has approached automated driving, although there are key differences in their business models. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wayve doesn’t want to be the operator of its hands-free driving-assistance system or its “eyes-off” fully automated-driving system. (For comparison, Waymo is largely the operator of its robotaxis, although it does have partners.) Nor does Wayve want to build vehicles bundled with its own software, as Tesla does. Instead, it is selling its “embodied AI” to automakers and other tech companies like Uber. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kendall argues that this is the business model with the largest addressable market, but he says it’s only viable because Wayve built an AI that generalizes across different hardware and environments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you build an autonomy stack that’s specific to a sensor or compute architecture, [or] if you build it where it requires mapping or something like this, then you can’t take option three,” Kendall said, referring to the business model his company has chosen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nissan and Uber are both Wayve customers. Nissan said the startup’s self-driving software will be used to beef up the advanced driver-assistance system in its cars <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/wayves-self-driving-tech-is-headed-to-nissan-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">starting in 2027</a>. Meanwhile, later this year, Uber plans to launch commercial trials in vehicles equipped with Wayve’s software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its relationship with Uber appears poised to stretch well beyond a pilot program, though. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s statement Tuesday hints at the scope of its partnership with and investment in Wayve. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are very proud to continue to deepen our partnership with Wayve, with plans to deploy together in more than 10 markets around the world. Wayve’s powerful end-to-end approach is purpose-built for scale, safety, and effectiveness, and we’re excited to work with them across multiple OEMs and geographies, which we’ll share more about soon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round was led by Eclipse, Balderton, and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. New investors include the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Baillie Gifford, British Business Bank, Icehouse Ventures, Schroders Capital, and other global institutional investors, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Global automakers Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis — all of which plan to use Wayve’s technology — also participated. Nvidia, which participated in Wayve’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/06/wayve-raises-1-billion-led-by-softbank-to-take-self-driving-to-cars-and-robots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.05 billion Series C round,</a> said last year it was evaluating a $500 million strategic investment in Wayve’s next raise. While Nvidia did participate, Kendall wouldn’t disclose the exact amount of its investment or whether it came close to that $500 million figure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated to include more information on the $300 million in additional funding from Uber. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As of today, developers can access a newer version of Multiverse’s HyperNova 60B model for free on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/09/hugging-face-reaches-2-billion-valuation-to-build-the-github-of-machine-learning/\">Hugging Face</a>. The company also plans to open source more compressed models in 2026 to support a wider range of use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Multiverse, its models are smaller, but nearly as potent and accurate. At 32GB, HyperNova 60B is roughly half the size of the model it derives from — OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b — while boasting lower memory usage and lower latency. The updated version, called <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/MultiverseComputingCAI/Hypernova-60B-2602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">HyperNova 60B 2602</a>, now also better supports ​​tool calling and agentic coding, where inference costs can be high.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the competitors Multiverse claims to have beaten with HyperNova 60B is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/mistral-closes-in-on-big-ai-rivals-with-mistral-3-open-weight-frontier-and-small-models/\">Mistral Large 3</a>, one of the models released by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/what-is-mistral-ai-everything-to-know-about-the-openai-competitor/\">French decacorn Mistral AI</a>. But beyond the technological rivalry, the two European AI companies also have a lot in common.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like Mistral, Multiverse has expanded beyond its home country, with offices in the United States, Canada, and across Europe. Both companies also have enterprise customers. In Multiverse’s case, it names Iberdrola, Bosch, and the Bank of Canada. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while Multiverse is not officially a unicorn yet, it is now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/ai-firm-multiverse-said-to-hit-1-5-billion-value-with-new-funds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rumored to be raising a fresh €500 million funding round</a> at a valuation of more than €1.5 billion. In a statement shared with TechCrunch, the company confirmed that active discussions with potential investors toward a new funding round are ongoing, but added it would be premature to comment on valuation or funding size at this stage. Multiverse also declined to comment on reports that its annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached €100 million in January.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If confirmed, this would still only be a fraction of <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/a-business-that-scales-with-the-value-of-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI’s $20 billion ARR</a>; but not that far from Mistral’s, whose ARR <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/664249e7-e8d5-4425-b397-ad3ed590b305\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">soared to over $400 million</a>, owing in part to growing demand for alternatives to U.S. tech.

As part of the changes, Apple will block the downloads of apps rated 18+ in Brazil, Australia, and Singapore, while also rolling out other features to comply with laws in Utah and Louisiana in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=f5zj08ey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">informed developers</a> on Tuesday that it’s expanding its set of “age assurance” tools, including an updated Declared Age Range API now available for beta testing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tools allow developers to obtain a user’s age range</a> without gaining access to the user’s personal information, like their date of birth. The need for a technical solution like this came about as more governments around the world have created laws to block or restrict certain apps like social media that can only be used by adults 18 and up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Brazil, for example, developers can use the Declared Age Range API to obtain the user’s age category, if the user or their parent or guardian chooses to share it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Apple will block users in Australia, Brazil, and Singapore from downloading apps rated 18+, starting today, until they confirm they are adults. In this case, the App Store will perform the age confirmation automatically, but Apple notes that developers may still have separate compliance requirements they need to meet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also, developers whose games contain loot boxes — a gambling-like mechanism that lets players spend money for a random chance at in-game rewards and that lawmakers believe shouldn’t be available to kids — will see their apps’ age ratings updated to reflect an 18+ audience in Brazil, specifically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.S., new users in Utah and Louisiana will soon have their age categories shared with their developers’ apps through the Declared Age Range API as well. The company said it has expanded its other tools around age ratings and permissions to meet its compliance obligations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“New signals are now available through the Declared Age Range API, including whether age-related regulatory requirements apply to the user and if the user is required to share their age range,” reads the Apple blog post. “The API will also let you know if you need to get a parent or guardian’s permission for significant app updates for a child.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple last October worked to comply with similar age-assurance requirements in Texas but <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/apple-pauses-app-store-changes-in-texas-after-court-blocks-age-assurance-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">put some of its plans on hold back in December,</a> as the state’s law is being fought in court. It also <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ks775ehf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">updated its age ratings system last year</a> with more granular age ranges than before and added a variety of new questions for developers submitting apps to Apple for review.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Both will feed Form’s battery, which will be capable of delivering its rated power for 100 hours. At 30 gigawatt-hours, it will be the largest battery in the world, helping the data center operate on clean energy for longer periods of time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such long-duration batteries help renewable energy sources continue to provide power at night or during lulls, “firming” the power source, as experts call it. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/energy-storage-industry-set-aggressive-goals-for-2025-and-already-crushed-them/\">Grid-scale lithium-ion batteries</a> do this already, though for shorter periods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/06/form-energys-iron-air-battery-on-pace-for-2024-launch-with-450m-series-e/\">Form Energy’s batteries</a> are unlike most other grid-scale batteries. Whereas a typical grid-scale battery today uses lithium-ion technology that’s been repurposed from chemistries used by the automotive industry, Form’s batteries store energy by rusting and deoxidizing iron. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When oxygen from the air flows over pebbles of iron inside the battery, it rusts the iron, generating electricity in the process. To charge, electrical current deoxidizes the rust, turning it back into metallic iron and releasing oxygen in the process, which is drawn out of the battery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As battery chemistries go, Form’s iron-air cells are heavy and not very efficient. Typical iron-air batteries can only deliver 50% to 70% of the energy used to charge them, compared with upwards of 90% for lithium-ion batteries. But for all their downsides, they come with one very large upside: they’re incredibly cheap. Form says 1 kilowatt-hour of storage will ultimately cost just $20 using their technology, which is at least three times cheaper than lithium-ion batteries.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new project also introduces a wonky utility fee structure to Minnesota that’s intended to help utilities adopt clean technologies without running afoul of their regulators, which push utilities to use the cheapest source of electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google first developed the concept in Nevada, where it’s buying power from enhanced geothermal startup Fervo. Alternately called the “clean transition tariff” or the “clean energy accelerator charge,” the agreement between Google and Xcel allows the utility to accept projects that might be considered risky by regulators, with the tech company paying a premium to ensure that regular ratepayers aren’t left holding the bag. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solar and wind are both proven technologies, but Form’s iron-air batteries are still relatively new. The startup’s first battery is currently being installed in Minnesota with cooperative utility Great River Energy, and it will store 150 megawatt-hours for 100 hours, sending 1.5 megawatts to the grid at its peak. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Form makes its batteries at a factory in West Virginia. The company has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook data.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
