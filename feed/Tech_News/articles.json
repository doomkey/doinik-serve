OpenAI will be an “off-taker” in the project, buying capacity from the data center. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement comes as Europe races to achieve AI sovereignty and invest in data centers and compute power. Earlier this week, the bloc unveiled details of its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/europe-sets-its-sights-on-multi-billion-euro-gigawatt-ai-factories.html\">multi-billion-dollar investment</a> into AI infrastructure, including 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) to set up 13 AI factories and 20 billion euros as an initial investment in the factories. Data sovereignty is key to that mission, due to the sensitive nature of business and government data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if OpenAI’s data center is a part of the European Union’s plans to scale AI at home, and OpenAI did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Nscale CEO Josh Payne <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/openai-backs-ai-data-center-in-norway-with-100000-nvidia-gpus.html\">told CNBC</a> that part of the purpose of this project is to “leverage European sovereign compute” for the benefit of the continent. Norway’s AI ecosystem, like startups and scientific researchers, will get priority access to the center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CNBC also reported that Nscale and Aker have each committed around $1 billion to the initial 20 megawatt (MW) phase of the project. OpenAI says Stargate Norway will initially deliver 230 MW capacity, with plans to expand to 290 MW, and will run on 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The site will be located near Narvik, a small town in northern Norway. OpenAI said in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-stargate-norway/\">a blog post</a> the region is notable for its access to hydropower, a cool climate, and a “mature industrial base.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The facility will run entirely on renewable power and is expected to incorporate closed-loop, direct-to-chip liquid cooling to ensure maximum cooling efficiency,” said OpenAI. “Additionally, excess heat from the GPU systems will be made available to support low-carbon enterprises in the region.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/google-says-it-will-sign-eus-ai-code-of-practice/\">EU AI Act</a>, which took effect in August 2024 and bans systems with “unacceptable risk,” companies building data centers must take steps to protect the environment and be transparent about the energy consumption of AI models. Additionally, the bloc’s Energy Efficiency Directive emphasizes energy efficiency in the ICT sector, which includes data centers. The directive also directs data centers exceeding certain energy input thresholds to recover waste heat. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Stargate Norway announcement comes seven months after OpenAI announced it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">invest $500 billion</a> into 10 gigawatts of AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years, in partnership with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/openai-agreed-to-pay-oracle-30b-a-year-for-data-center-services/\">Oracle</a> and Softbank. The deal also follows the launch of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/openai-teams-up-with-cisco-oracle-to-build-uae-data-center/\">Stargate UAE</a> earlier this year, and a recently <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdv68gejm7o\">signed deal with the UK government</a> to accelerate AI adoption and boost infrastructure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/arrakis_ai/status/1882343287522226591\">a user on X who goes by Choi</a> spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-openai-tests-phone-number-only-chatgpt-signups\">OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/openai-tests-letting-users-sign-up-for-chatgpt-with-only-a-phone-number/\">sign up with only a phone number</a> — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks\">ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks/\">allows users to set simple reminders</a>. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-chatgpt-feature-lets-users-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z\">New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/chatgpts-newest-feature-lets-user-assign-it-traits-like-chatty-and-gen-z/\">customize their interactions with ChatGPT.</a> Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/Makuh90/status/1877479064967295484\">some users reported</a> that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-faqs\">FAQs:</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is ChatGPT? How does it work?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai/\">OpenAI</a>. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When did ChatGPT get released?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the latest version of ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/openais-newest-model-is-gpt-4o/\">GPT-4o</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I use ChatGPT for free?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a free version of <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/auth/login?next=/chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT</a> that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatGPT Plus</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who uses ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/microsofts-new-bing-was-using-gpt-4-all-along/\">search engines</a> are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What companies use ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/apple-reportedly-limits-internal-use-of-ai-powered-tools-like-chatgpt-and-github-copilot/\">limit the use of the AI-powered tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/windows-11-gets-an-ai-copilot/\">Microsoft announced</a> at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/looking-glass-taps-chatgpt-for-holograms-you-can-talk-to/\">Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT</a> to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/solana-chatgpt-blockchain/\">Solana officially integrated the chatbot</a> into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT write essays?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT commit libel?</h4>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/the-great-pretender/\">Due to the nature of how these models work</a>, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We will see how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT</a> will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an app?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/chatgpts-mobile-app-revenue-saw-biggest-spike-yet-following-gpt-4o-launch/\">there is a free ChatGPT mobile app</a> for iOS and Android users.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the ChatGPT character limit?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does ChatGPT have an API?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/openai-launches-an-api-for-chatgpt-plus-dedicated-capacity-for-enterprise-customers/\">released</a> March 1, 2023.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How good is ChatGPT at writing code?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you save a ChatGPT chat?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. There are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/17/developers-are-looking-for-creative-ways-to-build-ai-powered-chatbot-assistants/\">multiple AI-powered chatbot</a> competitors such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.together.xyz/\">Together</a>, Google’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/what-is-google-gemini-ai/\">Gemini</a> and Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/anthropic-launches-claude-a-chatbot-to-rival-openais-chatgpt/\">Claude</a>, and developers are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/theres-now-an-open-source-alternative-to-chatgpt-but-good-luck-running-it/\">creating open source</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meet-the-team-developing-an-open-source-chatgpt-alternative/\">alternatives</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out <a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this form</a>. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “<a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request</a>”.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">here</a> for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/jailbreak-tricks-discords-new-chatbot-into-sharing-napalm-and-meth-instructions/\">two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine</a> (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Australian mayor has publicly announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/06/australian-mayor-prepares-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">he may sue OpenAI for defamation</a> due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Futurism reported</a> the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">accused</a> of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several major school systems and colleges, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/as-nyc-public-schools-block-chatgpt-openai-says-its-working-on-mitigations-to-help-spot-chatgpt-generated-text/\">including New York City Public Schools</a>, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">not every educator agrees with</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have also been cases of ChatGPT <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/can-ai-commit-libel-were-about-to-find-out/\">accusing individuals of false crimes</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is <a href=\"https://promptbase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PromptBase</a>. Another is <a href=\"https://chatx.ai/marketplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ChatX</a>. More launch every day.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can ChatGPT be detected?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/openai-releases-tool-to-detect-ai-generated-text-including-from-chatgpt/\">tests</a>, they’re inconsistent at best.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are ChatGPT chats public?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. But OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649806/chatgpt-chat-histories-bug-exposed-disabled-outage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">recently</a> disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/28/23575919/microsoft-openai-github-dismiss-copilot-ai-copyright-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">involved</a> in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story is continually updated with new information.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And the company is talking a very big game: CEO Jim Farley <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-fords-q2-2025-earnings-surpass-expectations-93CH-4161537\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> Wednesday that the announcement is “a Model T moment” for Ford.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Farley made the comments after Ford revealed its electric vehicle division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025. Sales of the company’s top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are declining, all while things are looking increasingly tough for electric vehicles under the second Trump administration. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Farley first revealed that Ford had a skunkworks team developing a low-cost electric vehicle in February 2024. As TechCrunch first reported, the effort is being led by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/ex-tesla-exec-leading-ford-skunkworks-project-to-develop-low-cost-ev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">former Tesla executive Alan Clarke</a>, and the team is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/fords-secretive-low-cost-ev-team-is-growing-with-talent-from-rivian-tesla-and-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">brimming with talent</a> from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been deliberately vague about any specifics, but has admitted that the first vehicle to be built on this new low-cost platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/ford-ev-low-cost-pickup-skunkworks-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">will be a mid-size pickup truck</a> set for release in 2027. Ford has said it will build “multiple vehicle styles — for both retail and commercial customers” on the platform, and that these vehicles will feature “personalized digital experiences.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cheaper models could help Ford, but 2027 is still a long way out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there are basically no mass-market electric vehicles available in the U.S. at or under $30,000, that likely won’t be the case when Ford’s secretive EVs hit the market in two years. Tesla has said it will start selling a stripped-down (and possibly smaller) Model Y SUV later this year. General Motors is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/topic/us/en/2025/jul/0729-Sneak-preview-2027-Chevrolet-Bolt.html\">bringing back the Chevy Bolt next year</a>.

The company said that it has experimented with age estimation tech in some markets (without specifying which ones), and it worked well. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Age assurance helps us ensure that adults can access the information and services they need, while also applying the right protections for our younger users.

The company says it’s doing this because it’s aware that customers are more likely to order a dish when they are able to see what it looks like.

Proton Authenticator is built for anyone who wants a secure, transparent, and convenient way to protect their accounts,” Eamonn Maguire, Head of Account Security at Proton, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We believe strong security should never come at the cost of your convenience or privacy. That’s why we’ve developed Proton Authenticator: to give users peace of mind that their 2FA codes are available wherever they need them, without relying on Google or Microsoft. We’re putting users firmly in control not only over their data, but the way they access their online accounts,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two-factor authentication using an app provides users with an extra layer of security to prevent attackers from taking over accounts. While SMS-based two-factor authentication is another option, it is often vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks, in which attackers can intercept your calls and messages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Proton is on a product-releasing spree.

A GitHub spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that this number represents “all-time users.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means five million people have tried out GitHub Copilot for the first time in the last three months; the company reported in April <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thurrott.com/dev/320356/github-copilot-has-over-15-million-users\">the tool had reached 15 million users</a>. Microsoft and GitHub don’t report how many of these 20 million people have continued to use the AI coding tool on a monthly or daily basis — though those metrics are likely far lower.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft also reported GitHub Copilot, which is among the most popular AI coding tools offered today, is used by 90% of the Fortune 100. The product’s growth among enterprise customers has also grown about 75% compared to last quarter, according to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI coding tools are rising in popularity, and they seem to be one of the few AI products generating notable revenue. In 2024, Nadella said <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2024/earnings-fy-2024-q4\">GitHub Copilot was a larger business</a> than all of GitHub was when Microsoft acquired it in 2018. In the year since, it seems GitHub Copilot’s growth rate has continued in a positive direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The world’s most popular AI coding tools still have tiny user bases compared to AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, which attract hundreds of millions of users every month. Of course, software engineering is more niche than the general informational queries offered by AI chatbots. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, software engineers and their employers seem to be willing to pay a premium for AI coding tools. And with Microsoft’s long list of enterprise customers and GitHub’s ecosystem of developers, GitHub Copilot is well positioned to dominate the market for enterprise AI coding tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cursor, another popular AI coding tool, wants to challenge GitHub Copilot in the enterprise, and it’s been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/cursor-snaps-up-enterprise-startup-koala-in-challenge-to-github-copilot/\">scooping up talent</a> from fledgling AI startups to do so. Cursor reportedly had <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/cursor-an-ai-coding-assistant-draws-a-million-users-without-even-trying\">more than a million people</a> using its product every day in March, according to Bloomberg. At that time, the company generated about $200 million in annualized recurring revenue. Today, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">Cursor’s ARR is more than $500 million</a>, suggesting there are now a lot more people using its products everyday.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While GitHub Copilot and Cursor initially sought to tackle different parts of the developer experience, they’re steadily converging into similar products. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both companies have recently introduced <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-copilot-code-review-now-generally-available/\">AI agents to review code</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cursor-releases-new-ai-tool-for-debugging-code/\">catch bugs</a> introduced by humans. Github and Cursor are also both trying to create <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/cursor-launches-a-web-app-to-manage-ai-coding-agents/\">AI agents that automate programmer workflows</a>, allowing developers to offload tasks altogether. Nadella said during Wednesday’s earnings call that GitHub was seeing great momentum with their AI coding agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond Cursor, GitHub has an array of well-capitalized competitors that would like to sell AI coding tools to the enterprise. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s Google — which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\">acquired the leaders of AI coding startup Windsurf</a> — as well as Cognition, the maker of Devin that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/cognition-maker-of-the-ai-coding-agent-devin-acquires-windsurf/\">subsequently acquired the rest of Windsurf’s team</a>. That’s not to mention OpenAI and Anthropic, which are both building out their own AI coding offerings powered by in-house AI models, Codex and Claude Code respectively, in an attempt to win the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The nascent space is quickly heating up into one of AI’s most competitive markets. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company reported Wednesday in its second-quarter letter to shareholders that it now has three self-driving trucks operating commercially between Dallas and Houston, and logged more than 20,000 driverless miles by the end of June. Its commercial self-driving trucks have a human “observer” in the cab, people who are not there to operate or intervene, according to the company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aurora has also opened a terminal in Phoenix, another physical sign of its Sunbelt trucking-route mission. Aurora is piloting autonomous trucking on a 15-hour route from its terminal in Fort Worth, Texas to Phoenix for customers, Hirschbach and Werner. The company’s terminals, which are located within one to five miles from the highway, require the driverless trucks to handle exits and surface streets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s the company’s ability to operate at night that helps it push into new territory. Aurora said Wednesday it has validated the ability for its driverless trucks to navigate highways and roads at night. This allows the trucks to travel longer distances — and importantly past the federally mandated service limitation for traditional human drivers. Truck drivers are allowed to drive up to 11 hours over a 14-hour period; and they can’t do that day after day. Truck drivers are also required to take 10-hour breaks after completing a long-haul route. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The value is really on longer lengths — so 600 miles is certainly a good range, where that is on the border of what’s possible for people,” Urmson told TechCrunch in a recent interview, adding that ultimately he hopes Aurora trucks are carrying freight from Miami to California. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Urmson partially credits Aurora’s proprietary, long-range lidar, which can detect objects in the dark more than 450 meters away, for its ability to operate at night. The lidar can identify pedestrians, vehicles, and debris up to 11-seconds sooner than a traditional driver, according to the company. Aurora has acquired two lidar companies since it was founded in 2017. The company bought<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/\"> Blackmore</a>, a Montana-based lidar startup, in May 2019 and OURS Technology in 2021. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Urmson and the rest of Aurora’s engineers are working to validate the driverless trucks’ ability to operate in rain. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By the end of the year, we expect to be operating day, night, and in rain —  if you can’t drive through the rain, ultimately, it’s hard to support these long operations because it’s raining somewhere,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Aurora’s development fleet does operate in the rain and well enough that Urmson noted most would wonder why the company isn’t allowing its commercial trucks to do the same. Aurora has not completed the validation for that today, and “so we’re not willing to put that check mark next to it and let it go out there,” he noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, the company monitors weather on its one commercial route between Dallas and Houston. If adverse weather conditions like rain suddenly arise, those trucks are able to detect this and pull themselves off the road on their own where they will wait to be rescued, Urmson said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This year is really about building the capability toolbox so that the vehicles can drive where they need to,” he said in a nod to the company’s focus on validating driving at night and in the rain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next year, Aurora will focus on scaling its road network, in terms of distances and its fleet. Aurora plans to have “tens of driverless trucks” operating on public roads by the end of the year and “hundreds” by the end of 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this, from the driverless trucks’ ability to function at night and in rain to opening more routes and a with a larger fleet, will be critical if Aurora ever hopes to reach profitability. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The revenue-to-net income gap today is a large one. Aurora reported revenue of $1 million in the second quarter and a net income loss of $201 million,<a href=\"https://ir.aurora.tech/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001828108-25-000139/aur-20250630.htm#i68418f0547a5466aa49beafe96058af5_16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> according to its regulatory filing</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

During Meta’s second-quarter earnings call, the social networking exec told investors he believes people without AI glasses will be at a disadvantage in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI, because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day, hear what you hear, [and] talk to you,” Zuckerberg said during the earnings call. Adding a display to those glasses will then unlock more value, he said, whether that’s a wider, holographic field of view, as with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/meta-developed-a-neural-interface-for-its-next-gen-orion-ar-glasses/\">Meta’s next-gen Orion AR glasses</a>, or a smaller display that might ship in everyday AI eyewear.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI — or some way to interact with AI — I think you’re …  probably [going to] be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people,” Zuckerberg added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has been focused on building smart glasses, like its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/meta-updates-its-smart-glasses-with-real-time-ai-video/\">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> and, more recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/meta-unveils-its-oakley-smart-glasses/\">Oakley Meta glasses</a>. The glasses let users listen to music, take photos or videos, and ask Meta AI questions, including about what they’re seeing, among other things. These wearables have turned into a surprise hit for the company, as revenue from sales of the Ray-Ban Metas <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/28/ray-ban-meta-revenue-tripled-essilorluxottica.html\">more than tripled year-over-year,</a> according to glasses giant EssilorLuxottica. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Zuckerberg believes there’s more to be done with displays. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is … what we’ve been maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years — basically doing the research on all these different things,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Reality Labs division has been a money pit for the company, so it’s not surprising the exec wants to justify its cost to investors by positioning it as a bet on the future of AI and consumer computing in general. For example, Meta said Reality Labs’ <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/250730/p41#a250730p41\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">operating loss was $4.53 billion</a> in the second quarter. Since 2020, the unit has lost <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/metas-reality-labs-second-quarter-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">nearly $70 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the future of consumer AI may or may not be in the form of glasses. This spring, OpenAI acquired former Apple executive <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/\">Jony Ive’s startup in a $6.5 billion deal</a> to build new consumer devices for interacting with AI. Already, other startups have dabbled in this area as well, including in form factors like AI pins — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/\">such as with Humane’s flop</a> — and pendents, like those from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/a16z-backed-rewind-pivots-to-build-ai-powered-pendant-to-record-your-conversations/\">Limitless</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/friend-delays-shipments-of-its-ai-companion-pendant/\">Friend</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Glasses, for now, seem to make the most sense, as many people already wear them, and they’re more socially acceptable. But the world didn’t know it needed smartphones, either, until someone dreamed them up. The next AI device could be something we can’t even imagine yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Zuckerberg cheers the idea that glasses are going to be it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The other thing that’s awesome about glasses is they are going to be the ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together,” he said. “So the whole Metaverse vision, I think, is going to … end up being extremely important, too, and AI is going to accelerate that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

A few months later, he was out of the job.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Markert is one of two former SpaceX employees who have filed separate wrongful-termination lawsuits, both of which were removed to federal court earlier this month. The two complaints make similar allegations about how speed and cost-saving triumphed over other considerations — including safety.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuits arrive as SpaceX races to get its Starship ultra-heavy rocket ready to complete missions for NASA, commercial customers, and to launch the company’s Starlink satellite internet service. Beyond the Starship program, SpaceX also operates the most frequently launched rocket in history, the Falcon 9, which has flown 87 times so far this year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Markert spent 13 years at the company before being terminated in April. He alleges that during his tenure technicians were sometimes required to work 15 to 20 days in a row, but when he brought this up to supervisors, he was told “the schedule comes first.” That punishing schedule, performed in a high-stress environment, resulted in injuries Markert alleges the ship technicians were too afraid to report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Markert suggested the company prioritize trainings and certifications, he was told “there is no time for that and the company would not spend money on it,” according to the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The second lawsuit, filed by SpaceX plumber David Lavalle, alleges he was fired after the company failed to accommodate multiple work-related injuries, including a fractured foot, severe neck pain, injuries to his back and shoulders, and wrist pain. While Lavalle filed for workers’ compensation for some of these injuries, he did not do so for all for fear of retaliation, the complaint says.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nine days after requesting medical leave for gout-induced knee pain, Lavalle was terminated. Lavalle, who is 60 years old, joined the company in 2014. He alleges in the complaint he was part of a wave of firings of older staff members, led in part by 28-year-old Scott Hiler, whom SpaceX hired as a new senior manager late last year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A lawyer representing Markert declined comment, while Lavalle’s attorney did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request  for comment. SpaceX did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/spacex-worker-injury-rates-at-starbase-outpace-industry-rivals/\">Recent reporting from TechCrunch</a> showed that SpaceX outpaced its peers in worker injury rates for 2024. Data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration showed that the Starbase complex in Texas recorded an injury rate of 4.27 per 100 workers last year, nearly triple the aerospace manufacturing average of 1.6.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Markert, a resident of Los Angeles County, doesn’t expressly state where he worked at SpaceX. The lawsuit does note he worked with ship technicians. SpaceX’s west coast rocket fairing recovery operations count the highest injury rates of all SpaceX sites, the OSHA logs show, with an injury rate of 7.6 per 100 workers for the west coast operations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both complaints were filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and were then removed by SpaceX to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said Wednesday in its second-quarter earnings report that it plans to more than double its spend on building AI infrastructure, like data centers and servers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion…up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the midpoint,” Meta said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s an aggressive capex growth, and one that Meta plans to continue onwards to 2026. The company said it expects a similarly large increase in spend on AI infrastructure next year as the company continues to “aggressively [pursue] opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of [its] artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences, so we expect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that work,” said Susan Li, Meta CFO, during the company’s Wednesday earnings call. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Li also noted that while Meta expects to finance most of its AI spend on its own, the company is exploring ways to work with financial partners to co-develop data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure, while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time,” Li said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta has announced two major AI “titan clusters.” The first is Prometheus in Ohio, which is poised to be among the first AI superclusters to hit 1 gigawatt of compute power when it comes online in 2026. Then there’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">Hyperion</a>, a cluster in Louisiana that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has bragged would have a footprint the size of Manhattan and could scale up to 5 gigawatts over several years. On top of those, Meta has several other unnamed titan-scale clusters underway. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s data center projects promise to soak up enough energy to power millions of homes, pulling that electricity from nearby communities. One of the company’s projects in Newton County, Georgia, has already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">caused the water taps to run dry in some residents’ homes</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta also noted in its earnings report that it expects its second-largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as the company spends millions, and possibly even billions, to poach talented AI engineers and researchers to work for Meta’s newly formed business unit, Superintelligence Labs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before earnings, Zuckerberg shared his vision for “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-meta-likely-wont-open-source-all-of-its-superintelligence-ai-models/\">personal superintelligence</a>,” the idea that AI should help individual people live their best lives, mainly through the medium of Meta’s smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s stock surged 10% in after-hours as investors responded to Meta’s overall performance in the quarter and better-than-expected outlook for the third quarter. Meta reported revenue of $47.5 billion in the second quarter, with expectations to hit between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion in Q3. Advertising drove Meta’s revenue gains, fueled by AI tools — like AI-powered translations and video generation — to help advertisers create more meaningful and targeted campaigns. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s Reality Labs segment, however, saw a $4.5 billion loss. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to reflect Meta’s additional paths to funding its AI infrastructure builds.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That figure is up 6% year-over-year and helped drive the total family of apps revenue to $47.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company additionally shared that video time spent increased 20% year-over-year in the quarter, also due to optimizations of Meta’s ranking systems and its work to promote more original content on Instagram. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta’s X competitor, Threads, was also seeing time spent gains due to the “incorporation of LLMs,” Meta noted. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move came after a 2021 ruling by India’s Supreme Court that categorized fantasy sports as “games of skill” rather than gambling — and therefore “legal.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after the pilot announced, online gaming platform WinZO <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/indian-firm-winzo-sues-google-stop-new-gaming-policy-calls-it-discriminatory-2022-09-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a complaint</a> with the Delhi High Court, calling the program discriminatory for excluding other real-money games. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) took up the case and, in November last year, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-competition-watchdog-investigate-googles-gaming-app-policy-2024-11-28/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ordered a formal probe</a> into Google’s policies for real-money gaming apps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January last year, Google announced it would expand support for real-money gaming apps on the Play Store in India, Brazil, and Mexico. However, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/google-is-pausing-its-experiment-of-allowing-real-money-games-on-the-play-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">paused</a> that rollout in June 2024 and stated it would continue to allow apps already included in the 2022 India pilot to remain on the platform.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside offering to expand its Play Store for all real-money games self-declared by developers, Google proposed to update its Developer Program Policies to reflect the update. The company also stated that it would finalize an “appropriate business model” for real-money game developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, Google has proposed to allow “games of skill” to be advertised in India where the app maker provides proof by a third party that it is a game of skill and not gambling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The recognized third parties in this case could even be industry associations such as the All India Gaming Federation, E-Gaming Federation, or the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said it would begin allowing compliant real-money games on its Play Store in India within 120 days of the CCI’s approval, while related ad policy changes would take effect within 150 days of the regulator’s order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re pleased the CCI is market testing our proposed framework for real-money games (RMGs) in India,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “This development reflects our constructive discussions with the CCI and the Indian developer community along with our commitment to building a more open and safe ecosystem for RMG apps across Google Play and Google Ads.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the proposal, if it is accepted by the CCI after public feedback, would benefit Google, which stands to earn a share of revenue from a broader range of real-money gaming apps and their ads on its platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Real-money gaming dominates India’s online gaming market, accounting for nearly 86% of total industry revenue — ₹274.38 billion ($3 billion) in 2024 — per a <a href=\"https://www.ibef.org/news/india-s-online-gaming-sector-may-cross-rs-77-688-crore-us-9-billion-by-2029-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">joint report</a> by WinZO and the Interactive Entertainment and Innovation Council (IEIC) released earlier this year. However, its share is expected to decline slightly to 80% by 2029, as non-real-money games grow in popularity and the overall market expands to ₹785.51 billion ($8.9 billion).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s latest proposal could also offer a boost to developers currently distributing their apps outside the Play Store — including via APK files on their own websites. However, the CCI’s investigation is still ongoing, and the regulator has yet to determine whether Google engaged in discriminatory practices in this space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The probe adds to a growing list of antitrust challenges for Google in India, where the U.S.-headquartered tech giant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/25/google-hit-with-113-million-fine-in-india-for-anti-competitive-practices-with-play-store-policies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has already been fined</a> for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/15/india-orders-antitrust-probe-into-google-app-store-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">allegedly abusing its dominance</a> through Android and the Play Store. The company recently <a href=\"https://www.medianama.com/2025/07/223-google-play-store-billing-supreme-court-cci/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">approached the Supreme Court</a> to appeal one of these rulings and contest the CCI’s findings. The case is expected to be listed for hearing next month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We look forward to continuing to work with the CCI and the wider RMG ecosystem, and are confident our proposed framework will empower Indian developers, grow the digital economy, and prioritize user safety,” Google’s spokesperson said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deal, a mix of cash and stock, marks Palo Alto’s entrance into the identity security space, according to a company press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palo Alto has been on a shopping spree since Nikesh Arora took over as CEO and chairman of the company in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8e00344-f791-4964-bada-c68de70dbfcf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the Financial Times</a>, which estimated the company has spent more than $7 billion on acquisitions since Arora started. The company’s acquisition of CyberArk is the largest to date.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of Palo Alto’s other acquisitions include: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/31/confirmed-palo-alto-networks-buys-dig-security-sources-say-for-400m/\">Dig Security</a>, for an estimated $400 million in October 2023; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/confirmed-palo-alto-has-acquired-talon-cyber-security-sources-say-for-625m/\">Talon Cyber Security</a> for an estimated $625 million in November 2023; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/sources-palo-alto-networks-acquired-devops-security-startup-bridgecrew-for-around-200m/\">Bridgecrew</a> for $156 million in February 2021, among others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is one of the largest cybersecurity deals thus far in 2025. The largest deal was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/google-is-buying-wiz-for-32b-to-beef-up-in-cloud-security/\">Google’s acquisition of Wiz</a> in March for $32 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palo Alto Networks did not immediately comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
