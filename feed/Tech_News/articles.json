Apple has chosen to work with Google, a longtime partner, to power AI features like Siri. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” Apple and Google said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership confirms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/apple-is-in-talks-to-use-googles-gemini-for-siri-revamp-report-says/\">previous reporting</a> on a deal with Google. Neither Apple nor Google have confirmed the price tag, but previous reports indicate Apple could be paying Google around<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/apple-nears-deal-to-pay-google-1b-annually-to-power-new-siri-report-says/\">$1 billion</a> for access to its AI technology. The deal also comes after Apple spent some time testing the technology of competitors<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/heres-how-chatgpt-integration-works-for-apple-intelligence/\">like OpenAI </a>and Anthropic. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The multi-year partnership will involve Apple using Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models. The deal is not exclusive, per a source familiar with the matter. Apple has historically focused on vertical integration, relying on its own hardware and software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone-maker has faced a fair amount of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/apple-just-named-a-new-ai-chief-with-google-and-microsoft-expertise-as-john-giannandrea-steps-down/\">public chatter criticizing</a> it after its AI efforts, particularly its assistant Siri, lagged behind competitors. That’s not to say Apple hasn’t been quietly building powerful foundational models. The company released the first versions of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/apple-intelligence-everything-you-need-to-know-about-apples-ai-model-and-services/\">Apple Intelligence</a> in 2024, which adds AI to existing OS functions like searching for photos and summarizing notifications. Apple has also focused on privacy with its AI rollout, with much of the processing happening on-device or through tightly controlled infrastructure. Apple says it will maintain those privacy standards throughout its partnership with Google. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm’s strategy has resulted in a subtle, sometimes invisible, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-are-honestly-pretty-bad/\">occasionally resented</a> form of AI – one that doesn’t have the same wow factor as ChatGPT or Gemini. It also stops short of delivering the kind of Siri overhaul many users have been waiting for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/ai-powered-more-personalized-siri-is-delayed/\">delayed</a> the rollout of its “more personalized Siri” voice assistant several times, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch an upgrade is coming this year. Previous reports indicate the overhauled Siri is expected to launch in the spring. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple’s partnership with Google also comes as the search and adtech giant is in the midst of multiple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">antitrust lawsuits</a>, including one that put its relationship with Apple front and center. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/google-loses-massive-antitrust-case-over-search/\">Google acted illegally</a> to maintain a monopoly in online search by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/technology/google-apple-search-spotlight.html\">paying companies like Apple</a> to present its search engine as the default on its devices and web browsers. Between 2021 and 2022, Google paid Apple about $38 billion to secure default search placements. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December 2025, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/judge-finalize-remedies-in-google-antitrust-case.html\">Judge Amit Mehta issued his final remedies</a> on the case, which include banning Google from entering into exclusive, default agreements like the one it had with Apple “unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Discovery (WBD) in Delaware, demanding greater financial disclosure regarding Netflix’s $82.7 billion acquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.paramount.com/press/paramount-provides-update-to-warner-bros-discovery-shareholders-on-actions-it-is-taking-to-advance-its-superior-30-per-share-all-cash-offer\">a letter to shareholders,</a> Ellison disclosed that the lawsuit has been filed in the Delaware Chancery Court, requesting that WBD provide essential information that it allegedly has failed to share. Ellison argues that shareholders need accurate information to assess whether to accept Paramount’s competing offer of $30 per share in cash, which he claims is superior to Netflix’s deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ellison wrote, “WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Along with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation…WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its ‘risk adjustment’ of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer,” Ellison added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last week, WBD’s board <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/\">rejected Paramount’s latest bid</a> once again, saying there’s too much risk of the deal falling through.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Trump also expressed his dissatisfaction with the merger. Over the weekend, Trump shared on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115877170851219343\">Truth Social</a> an opinion piece by John Pierce titled “Stop the Netflix Cultural Takeover,” published in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oann.com/commentary/stop-the-netflix-cultural-takeover/\">One America News </a>last month. Pierce believes if Netflix acquires Warner Bros.’ streaming and studio assets, it would establish itself as “the most dominant cultural gatekeeper the United States—and much of the world—has ever seen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After meeting with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in December, Trump <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-says-netflix-warner-bros-deal-problem-will-involved-approval-rcna247923\">indicated</a> that the merger “could be a problem,” due to Netflix’s already significant market share, which would expand greatly with the acquisition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry has also generally reacted negatively to the acquisition, raising concerns about job implications, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Netflix co-CEOs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/\">Greg Peters and Sarandos</a> attempted to address these fears in a letter last month. However, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) continues to oppose the acquisition, citing antitrust law violations. Lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal, warn that the merger could lead to increased consumer costs, exacerbating financial pressures on middle-class families, especially following Netflix’s recent price hike. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The app has been taken down from the two major app stores and it’s banned from most social platforms, but it’s still available on the web and through a Telegram bot. In October, a clinic at Yale Law School filed a lawsuit that would take down the app entirely, forcing the owners to delete all images and cease operation entirely. But simply finding the defendants has been a challenge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s incorporated in the British Virgin Islands,” explains Professor John Langford, a co-lead counsel in the lawsuit, “but we believe it’s run by a brother and sister and Belarus. It may even be part of a larger network around the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a bitter lesson in the wake of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/x-restricts-groks-image-generation-to-paying-subscribers-only-after-drawing-the-worlds-ire/\">the recent flood of non-consensual pornography</a> generated by Elon Musk’s xAI, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">included many underage victims</a>. Child sexual abuse material is the most legally toxic content on the internet — illegal to produce, transmit or store, and regularly scanned for on every major cloud service. But despite the intense legal prohibitions, there are still few ways to deal with image generators like ClothOff, as Langford’s case demonstrates. Individual users can be prosecuted, but platforms like ClothOff and Grok are far more difficult to police, leaving few options for victims hoping to find justice in court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The clinic’s complaint, which is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.585002/gov.uscourts.njd.585002.1.0.pdf?utm_campaign=149-the-irs-has-a-sidewalk-problem&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.courtwatch.news\">available online</a>, paints an alarming picture. The plaintiff is an anonymous high school student in New Jersey, whose classmates used ClothOff to alter her Instagram photos. She was 14 years old when the original Instagram photos were taken, which means the AI-modified versions are legally classified as child abuse imagery. But even though the modified images are straightforwardly illegal, local authorities declined to prosecute the case, citing the difficulty of obtaining evidence from suspects’ devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Neither the school nor law enforcement ever established how broadly the CSAM of Jane Doe and other girls was distributed,” the complaint reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the court case has moved slowly. The complaint was filed in October, and in the months since, Langford and his colleagues have been in the process of serving notice to the defendants — a difficult task given the global nature of the enterprise. Once they’ve been served, the clinic can push for a court appearance and, eventually, a judgment, but in the meantime the legal system has given little comfort to ClothOff’s victims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Grok case might seem like a simpler problem to fix. Elon Musk’s xAI isn’t hiding, and there’s plenty of money at the end for lawyers who can win a claim. But Grok is a general purpose tool, which makes it much harder to hold it accountable in court.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“ClothOff is designed and marketed specifically as a deepfake pornography image and video generator,” Langford told me. “When you’re suing a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it gets a lot more complicated.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A number of US laws have already banned deepfake pornography — most notably <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAKE_IT_DOWN_Act\">the Take It Down Act</a>. But while specific users are clearly breaking those laws, it’s much harder to hold the entire platform accountable. Existing laws require clear evidence of an intent to harm, which would mean providing evidence xAI knew their tool would be used to produce non-consensual pornography. Without that evidence, xAI’s basic first amendment rights would provide significant legal protection..</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In terms of the First Amendment, it’s quite clear Child Sexual Abuse material is not protected expression,” Langford says. “So when you’re designing a system to create that kind of content, you’re clearly operating outside of what’s protected by the First Amendment. But when you’re a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it’s not so clear.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The easiest way to surmount those problems would be to show that xAI had willfully ignored the problem. It’s a real possibility, given <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/tech/elon-musk-xai-digital-undressing\">recent reporting</a> that Musk directed employees to loosen Grok’s safeguards. But even then, it would be a far riskier case to take on.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Reasonable people can say, we knew this was a problem years ago,” Langford says. “How can you not have had more stringent controls in place to make sure this doesn’t happen? That is a kind of recklessness or knowledge but it’s just a more complicated case.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those First Amendment issues are why xAI’s biggest pushback has come from court systems without robust legal protections for free speech. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">Both Indonesia and Malaysia</a> have taken steps to block access to the Grok chatbot, while regulators in the United Kingdom have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy875j28k0o\">opened an investigation</a> that could lead to a similar ban. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/tracking-regulator-responses-to-the-grok-undressing-controversy/\">Other preliminary steps</a> have been taken by the European Commission, France, Ireland, India and Brazil. In contrast, no US regulatory agency has issued an official response.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s impossible to say how the investigations will resolve, but at the very least, the flood of imagery raises lots of questions for regulators to investigate — and the answers could be damning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you are posting, distributing, disseminating Child Sexual Abuse material, you are violating criminal prohibitions and can be held accountable,” Langford says. “The hard question is, what did X know? What did X do or not do? What are they doing now in response to it?“</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The deals have to be approved by the bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of Texas before they are finalized. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell has signaled interest in submitting a bid for the lidar assets and tried to buy the whole company in October, before it filed for bankruptcy. The company is currently trying to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/luminar-claims-founder-austin-russell-is-dodging-a-subpoena-in-the-bankruptcy-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">serve him with a subpoena</a> for information stored on his cell phone, as Luminar evaluates whether it wants to make any legal claims against him related to the board-run ethics inquiry that led to his resignation last May. It’s not known how many other bids Luminar might receive by Monday’s deadline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quantum Computing Inc. has been designated as a “stalking horse bidder,” which helps establish a baseline for the value of the assets and helps prevent low-ball bids. Luminar has said it wants to move through the bankruptcy case quickly, as its largest creditors — mostly financial institutions that loaned the company money over the last few years — are helping fund the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Luminar receives a higher offer, the stalking horse bid represents a monumental fall from the company’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/11/26/will-luminar-stock-continue-to-decline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">peak market cap</a> in 2021, when it was worth around $11 billion. That valuation was propped up by the promise that Luminar’s lidar sensors were going to become widely adopted by major automakers like Volvo, which at one point planned to buy more than 1 million of them before ultimately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">walking away from the deal in 2025</a>.

Founded in 2024, the company is now <a href=\"https://www.harmattan.ai/blog/harmattan-ai-200-million-series-b-led-by-dassault-aviation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">valued at $1.4 billion</a> after raising a $200 million Series B round led by Dassault Aviation, which is best known for making the Rafale fighter jet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harmattan AI, which builds autonomy and mission-system software for defense aircraft, had already received strong validation signals from the French and British ministries of defense in its less than two years of existence. But this funding and the accompanying partnership will give new wings to a company that once <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/harmattan-ai-seeks-200m-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described itself</a> as a “European Anduril.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like its American peer, Harmattan AI once aspired to overtake defense incumbents, which are also known as primes. But the company is now also ready to partner with them — even if it means no longer <a href=\"https://www.harmattan.ai/blog/harmattan-ai-awarded-program-of-record-one-year-after-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">calling itself</a> “a next-generation defense prime.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Harmattan’s latest press release, the now “defense technology company” will help Dassault Aviation shape the future of air combat by developing embedded AI capabilities for its next generations of Rafales and drones while making sure this implementation is both sovereign and scalable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The use of drones in Ukraine has been a wake-up call for NATO armies, creating tailwinds for defense tech startups that can help them adapt. According to Harmattan AI, which recently <a href=\"https://skyeton.com/news/skyeton-and-harmattan-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partnered</a> with Ukrainian drone maker Skyeton, the funding will help it extend its product offering into new domains and scale manufacturing of its platforms for drone interception, electronic warfare, and ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">French president Emmanuel Macron praised the announcement <a href=\"https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2010618107476287767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on social media</a>, calling it “excellent news for our strategic autonomy, for the technological superiority of our armed forces in the field of AI-activated defense drones, as well as for our economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While important for France, this strategic play isn’t exclusive. Harmattan AI’s stated goal of “empowering the armed forces of liberal democracies and their allies” leaves some wiggle room for the company to sell its technology beyond France and Europe. The company is already putting this into action: it will <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406313137953587200/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">exhibit</a> at the World Defense Show in Riyadh next month, and is expanding <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391219959227404289/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its U.S. team</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claimed <a href=\"https://www.harmattan.ai/blog/harmattan-ai-awarded-program-of-record-one-year-after-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a new record</a> in July when it was <a href=\"https://www.harmattan.ai/blog/harmattan-ai-awarded-program-of-record-one-year-after-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">awarded</a> a “multi-million-U.S. dollar contract by a NATO government” for the delivery of AI-enabled small drones, just one year after its founding.

The continent is undergoing rapid industrialization, he told TechCrunch. There is money, opportunity, and a young, driven population. He figured, soon enough, the continent was on the “edge of an industrial revolution.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the same time,” he said, he felt the continent still struggled to address what was one of its biggest Achilles heels. “Terrorism and insecurity.” Africa <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8vyl3j5kko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has more terror-related deaths</a> than any region in the world, and it is this problem that could slow down — or even stop completely — the growth of the region, Nwachuku said. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He teamed up with a friend, Maxwell Maduka, 24, and <a href=\"https://www.terraindustries.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Terra Industries,</a> a defense company that designs infrastructure and autonomous systems to help governments and organizations monitor and respond to threats. The company announced Monday that it emerged from stealth with a $11.75 million round led by Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Others in the round include Valor Equity Partners, Lux Capital, SV Angel, and Nova Global. The company previously raised an $800,000 pre-seed round, and Nwachuku said others took much interest in the company after it appeared on CNN. African investors in the company include Tofino Capital, Kaleo Ventures, and DFS Lab. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The goal is to build Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks,” Nwachuku, the company’s CEO, said. Maduka serves as the company’s CTO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team is stacked with military experience: 40% of its engineers held the same role in the Nigerian military; 8VC’s Alex Moore, who specializes in defense investing, is also on the board, and Nigeria’s Vice Air Marshal Ayo Jolasinmi serves as an advisor. Maduka also served as an enginner in the Nigerian Navy and founded a drone company at 19. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, based in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, took a multi-domain approach to product development, considering how to protect critical infrastructure from the ground, water, and air. For the air, the company produces long-range and short-range drones. On the ground, it has surveillance towers and ground drones. The company is still working on developing maritime technology to help protect infrastructure such as offshore rigs and underwater pipelines. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Terra powers its tech with its proprietary software, ArtemisOS, which collects, analyzes, and synthesizes data in real time. Once threats are spotted, they alert response forces (such as security agencies) so they can intercept them. “We want to geofence all of Africa’s critical infrastructure and resources,” Nwachuku said, adding that the problem is not lack of firepower (many African armies already have that).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, it’s a lack of sovereign intelligence, as much of the intelligence that African countries depend on comes from Western powers, China, and Russia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to take the defense of our continent’s resources and infrastructure into Africa’s own hands,” Nwachuku continued. “We are the first truly Pan-African defense company.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Terra recently won its first federal contract, though it said it cannot provide more details. The company makes money when governments and commercial customers place orders for Terra systems and then pay an annual fee for data processing and storage. Nwachuku said the company has generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue so far and is protecting assets valued at around $11 billion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Commercial revenue comes from protecting private infrastructure, like gold mines or power plants. Terra said it is protecting at least two hydro power plants and several smaller mines, with most of the company’s clientele coming from Nigeria. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hopes to use the fresh capital to help expand and build more defense factories across Africa. It also wants to further expand its software capabilities and grow its AI team. It will open software offices in San Francisco and London, but the company said manufacturing will remain in Africa, with more factories opening across the continent to boost job creation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s clear Africa today is undergoing what I see as an epic struggle for its very survival,” Nwachuku said. “The only way for us to truly break ourselves from the shackles that have held us back for the last decade or two is ensuring the core resources, the core infrastructures of the continent, are entirely protected.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Advertising offers a high-margin revenue stream that scales with usage, while grocery delivery increases how frequently users open the app. The combination could help inDrive reduce reliance on ride commissions while reinforcing its core mobility business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">InDrive has built its position on affordability, using a peer-to-peer negotiation model that lets riders and drivers agree on fares directly rather than relying on fixed pricing. It nonetheless operates in a crowded market alongside global players such as Uber and local micro-commuting options including taxis and autorickshaws, prompting the company to look beyond rides alone. That backdrop shaped inDrive’s “super app” strategy, aimed at adding higher-frequency services such as grocery delivery in frontier and emerging markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Advertising on inDrive is being rolled out across markets including Mexico, Colombia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Egypt, and Morocco. The rollout follows mid-2025 tests that delivered hundreds of millions of impressions and drew interest from global consumer brands and banks, said Andries Smit, inDrive’s chief growth business officer, in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The advertising business will initially focus on placements within the app, including during the waiting period after a ride is booked and while passengers are en route, moments that generate high engagement and sustained attention, Smit told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In-car and on-vehicle advertising are part of the longer-term roadmap. However, Smit said inDrive plans to prioritise in-app formats through 2026, citing operational complexity around on-car advertising in emerging markets and stronger early returns from digital placements.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pakistan-the-next-big-market-for-indrive-s-super-app-play\">Pakistan, the next big market for inDrive’s “super app” play</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The focus on in-app advertising dovetails with inDrive’s push into groceries, a higher-frequency use case where the company expects to generate stronger engagement and advertising demand than from rides alone. InDrive is scaling grocery delivery in Pakistan, its second market after Kazakhstan, through a partnership with local dark-store operator Krave Mart, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-27/ride-hailing-unicorn-indrive-invests-in-pakistan-s-grocery-startup-krave-mart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">received an investment</a> from inDrive in December 2024.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pakistan stands out, Smit said, because of a combination of rising demand for quick commerce and inDrive’s own scale in the market. Grocery retail remains highly fragmented and informal, while urban consumers are increasingly turning to app-based delivery as more households juggle work and family responsibilities. Simultaneously, inDrive has emerged as one of the country’s leading mobility platforms, giving it a large, engaged user base to cross-sell groceries without the high customer acquisition costs that have weighed on many quick-commerce startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching in 2021, inDrive has steadily expanded its footprint in Pakistan, with ride volumes rising nearly 40% year-over-year in 2025, while deliveries through its courier services grew 67% in the first half of the year, per company data shared with TechCrunch. The company views Pakistan as one of its fastest-growing markets globally, with particularly high usage in major cities such as Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. Overall, inDrive operates ride-hailing services in more than 20 Pakistani cities and intercity services across over 200 locations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">InDrive’s grocery rollout in Pakistan will begin in Karachi, the country’s largest city and one of the company’s strongest markets, where users will be able to order daily essentials through the app with delivery times of around 20 to 30 minutes. The service will then expand to other major cities, including Lahore, Islamabad, and Rawalpindi, later this year as inDrive builds out supply and logistics with Krave Mart. The platform plans to offer more than 7,500 products — spanning fresh produce, meat and dairy, snacks and household items — alongside free delivery on orders above PKR 499 (about $2) with no service fees.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/indrive-groceries-pakistan-launch.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>inDrive</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to its rapid growth as a ride-hailing market, Pakistan has also emerged as a focal point for inDrive’s capital deployment. Of the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/indrive-launches-ventures-and-ma-arm-to-invest-100m-in-startups-across-emerging-markets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$100 million multi-year investment program</a> announced in late 2023, Smit said the largest share so far has been directed toward Pakistan, though he declined to disclose specific figures. He added that at least half of the overall $100 million commitment has already been deployed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re seeing incredible potential in Pakistan,” said Smit. “Ideally, we want to continue and double down on [investments] as we see performance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">InDrive’s growing focus on Pakistan comes despite broader investor caution toward the market. Venture capital and public investors have largely stayed on the sidelines amid geopolitical and macroeconomic risks, even as activity shows signs of recovery. Equity funding in Pakistan rose 63% YoY in 2025 to $36.6 million across 10 rounds, per a recent report by Karachi-based startup analyst firm Data Darbar — <a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40400887\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">well below the $347 million</a> and $331 million raised in 2021 and 2022, respectively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the gap between investor caution and on-the-ground demand is precisely where inDrive sees opportunity. Having operated across dozens of emerging markets, Smit said the company is more accustomed to volatility and less reliant on shifting capital-market sentiment, giving it confidence to invest where others hesitate. With an established local business and a large active user base, he noted that inDrive can also help partners scale without heavy spending on customer acquisition — an advantage that becomes especially valuable when external funding is scarce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">InDrive’s push into advertising and commerce is underpinned by scale. The company operates in 1,065 cities across 48 countries and has surpassed 360 million app downloads, making it the world’s second most-downloaded mobility app for the third consecutive year, behind Uber, per company data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking ahead, inDrive expects advertising to become a more meaningful contributor over the medium term, particularly as grocery and delivery volumes grow and create more opportunities for contextual promotions. Ride-hailing, which accounted for about 95% of inDrive’s revenue just a few years ago, now makes up closer to 85%, even as the core business continues to grow, reflecting how newer verticals are beginning to scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Groceries, delivery, advertising and, eventually, financial services are expected to play a larger role over the next three to five years as the company expands selectively across priority markets, Smit said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/hyundai-is-spending-close-to-1-billion-to-keep-self-driving-startup-motional-alive/\">$1 billion investment</a> to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/motional-cut-about-550-employees-around-40-in-recent-restructuring-sources-say/\">40% restructuring cut</a> in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/motional-delays-commercial-robotaxi-plans-amid-restructuring/\">paused everything</a> and picked option No. 1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081790\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is really critical for two things; One is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch got a first-hand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double parked Amazon delivery van. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Old plants are being refurbished, and investors are showering startups with cash. In the last several weeks of 2025 alone, nuclear startups <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/radiant-nuclear-raises-300m-for-its-semi-sized-1-mw-reactor/\">raised $1.1 billion</a>, largely on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/26/here-are-the-nuclear-fission-startups-backed-by-big-tech/\">investor optimism</a> that smaller nuclear reactors will succeed where the broader industry has recently stumbled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional nuclear reactors are massive pieces of infrastructure. The newest reactors built in the U.S. — Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia —  contain tens of thousands of tons of concrete, are powered by fuel assemblies 14 feet tall, and generate over 1 gigawatt of electricity each. But they were also eight years late and more than $20 billion over budget.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh crop of nuclear startups hopes that by shrinking the reactor, they’ll be able to sidestep both problems. Need more power? Just add more reactors. Smaller reactors, they argue, can be built using mass production techniques, and as companies produce more parts, they should get better at making them, which should drive down costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The magnitude of that benefit is something experts are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224028712#sec2\">still researching</a>, but today’s nuclear startups are depending on it being greater than zero.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But manufacturing isn’t easy. Just look at Tesla’s experience: The company struggled mightily to profitably produce the Model 3 in large numbers — and it had the benefit of being in the automotive industry, where the U.S. still has significant expertise. U.S. nuclear startups don’t have that advantage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have a number of friends who work in supply chain for nuclear, and they can rattle off like five to ten materials that we just don’t make in the United States,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/milowerner/\">Milo Werner</a>, general partner at DCVC, told TechCrunch. “We have to buy them overseas. We’ve forgotten how to make them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Werner knows a thing or two about manufacturing. Before becoming an investor, she worked at Tesla leading new product introduction, and before that, she did the same at FitBit, launching four factories in China for the wearables company. Today, in addition to investing at DCVC, Werner has co-founded the NextGen Industry Group, which works to advance the adoption of new technologies in the manufacturing sector.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When companies of any size want to manufacture something, they face two main challenges, Werner said. One is capital, which is often the biggest constraint since factories aren’t cheap. Fortunately for the nuclear industry, that shouldn’t pose much of a problem. “They’re awash in capital right now,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the nuclear industry isn’t immune from the other challenge all manufacturers face, which is a lack of human capital. “We haven’t really built any industrial facilities in 40 years in the United States,” Werner said. As a result, we’ve lost the muscle memory. “It’s like we’ve been sitting on the couch watching TV for 10 years and then getting up and trying to run a marathon the next day. It’s not good.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After decades of offshoring, the U.S. lacks people experienced with both factory construction and operations. “There are for sure some people in the United States who have been doing this, but we don’t have the quantum of people that we need for everybody to have a full staff of seasoned manufacturing people.” She not just talking about machine operators, but everyone from factory floor supervisors all the way up to CFOs and board members.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The good news is that Werner sees a lot of startups, nuclear and otherwise, building early versions of their products in close proximity to their technical team. “That is pulling manufacturing in closer to the United States because it allows them to have that cycle of improvement.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To reap the benefits of mass manufacturing, it’s helpful for startups of all stripes to start small and scale up. “Really leaning into modularity is very important for investors,” she said. The modular approach helps companies start producing small volumes early on so they can collect data on the manufacturing process. Ideally, that data will show improvement over time, which can put investors at ease. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits of mass manufacturing don’t happen overnight. Companies will often forecast cost reductions that can result from learning through manufacturing, but it might take longer than they expect. “Often it takes years, like a decade, to get there,” Werner said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The rollout, which builds off existing services at stores in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, will occur throughout this year and into 2027, Wing’s new chief business officer Heather Rivera told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion suggests customers are using Wing’s drone delivery service enough to warrant growth. Rivera said its top 25% customers are using the service three times a week. Some of the most commonly ordered items are eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, avocados, limes, lunchables, and snacks such as Takis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 150-store expansion announcement follows plans shared in June 2025 to launch in Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. Rivera said Wing will launch in Houston on January 15. Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement places the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/14/one-size-doesnt-fit-all-for-wings-drone-deliveries/\">former Google X project</a> firmly in the commercial enterprise category. And while Wing does have a partnership with DoorDash, its primary path to commercial operations has been, and still is, through Walmart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies first partnered in 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/walmart-is-adding-wing-drone-deliveries-to-limited-superstores-this-year/\">launching a pilot program </a>to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. The program later grew to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth and more recently spread to stores in Atlanta.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wing will continue to evolve its technology and operations, according to Rivera; the company recently completed the first commercial flights for its larger aircraft that can carry a five-pound payload, for instance. But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivera said Wing will likely try a couple of different approaches to scaling its operations like clustering store openings. It’s an approach Wing used last year when it launched six stores together in Atlanta. Rivera would not share if its operations are profitable or when they might be. But Rivera did note she was brought in to scale the business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And so that is what I’m here to do, and excited about,” she said, later noting that “volume is definitely powering our flywheel.” In other words, scaling to as many stores in as many markets as possible is critical for its business economics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users will be able to pay using Google Pay and pass on the shipping information saved in the Google Wallet. Google said that it will soon support PayPal as a payment option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is one of the really exciting parts about agentic,” said Shopify CEO and founder Tobi Lutke. “It’s really good at finding people who have specific interests and finding the product that is just perfect for them. Like, I would have never searched for this product, but somehow it found me right on the other side. This kind of serendipity is where the best of commerce happens.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Shopify also unveiled a similar integration with Microsoft Copilot for shopping today to let customers check out easily within the conversational flow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another consumer-facing change, Google said it will now allow brands to offer a special discount to users while they are looking for a product recommendation when using the AI mode. For instance, if you are searching for a rug using a query like “I’m looking for a modern, stylish rug for a high-traffic dining room. I host a lot of dinner parties, so I want something that is easy to clean,” brands can set up their campaign in a way to offer you a discount at that moment. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?w=443\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081722\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png 2440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=195,300 195w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=768,1180 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=443,680 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=781,1200 781w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=833,1280 833w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=280,430 280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=469,720 469w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=586,900 586w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=521,800 521w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=1000,1536 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=1333,2048 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=435,668 435w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=244,375 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=402,617 402w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=346,531 346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also giving users new data attributes within the Merchant Center to have sellers feature their items better within AI search surfaces.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CES has always been a robot extravaganza, and this year’s event saw the announcement of a number of important robotics developments, including the new, production-ready <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3079928/atlas-meet-atlas/\">debut of Atlas</a>, the humanoid from Boston Dynamics. Then there were all the robots on the showroom floor, where bots often serve as good marketing for the companies involved. If they don’t always give a totally accurate representation of where commercial deployment is at the moment, they do give visitors a peek at where it might be headed. And, of course, they sure are fun to look at. I spent a decent amount of time perusing the bots on display this week. Here are some of the most memorable ones I encountered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The ping pong player </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The movie <em>Marty Supreme</em> just came out a month ago, so I guess it’s only appropriate that there was a ping-pong-playing robot at this year’s convention. The Chinese <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ai-robotmaker-sharpa-reaches-key-milestone-with-mass-production-of-worlds-most-advanced-human-sized-robotic-hand-302643434.html\">robotics firm Sharpa</a> had rigged up a full-bodied bot to play some competitive table tennis against one of the firm’s staff. When I stopped by the Sharpa booth, the robot was losing to its human competitor, 5-9, and I would not characterize the game that was occurring as particularly fast-paced. Still, the spectacle of seeing a robot play ping pong was impressive enough on its own, and I’m sure I have known some humans whose paddle skills were basically equivalent to (or slightly worse than) the bot’s. A Sharpa rep told me that the company’s main product is its robotic hand, and that the full-bodied bot had been debuted at CES to demonstrate the hand’s dexterity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The boxer </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the exhibits that drew the largest crowds involved robots from the Chinese company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newatlas.com/ai-humanoids/engineai-t800-humanoid/\">EngineAI</a>, which is developing humanoid robots. The bots, dubbed the T800 (a nod to the Terminator franchise), were in a mock boxing ring and were styled as fighting machines. That said, I never saw any of the bots actually hit each other. Instead, they would sort of shadowbox <em>near</em> each other, never actually making contact. They were also a little unpredictable. One kept walking out of the ring and into the audience, which naturally got a rise out of onlookers. At another point, one of the bots tripped over its own feet and then face-planted on the floor, where it lay for awhile before it decided to get up again. So, not exactly a Mike Tyson situation, but the machines still managed to evoke a spooky kind of humanoid behavior that made for high-quality entertainment. I overheard an observer quip: “That’s too much like Robocop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The dancer</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dancing robots have long been a staple at CES, and this year was no different. This year, the dance-move torch was carried by bots from Unitree, a major Chinese robotics manufacturer that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://democrats-selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/select-committee-sounds-alarm-ccp-robots-inside-us-institutions\">has been scrutinized</a> for potential ties to the Chinese military. Unitree has made a number of impressive announcements about its product base, including a humanoid bot that can supposedly <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/robots/a60192610/h1-robot-speed-record/\">run at speeds of up to 11 mph</a>. I didn’t see any evidence of anything nefarious at Unitree’s booth this week—just a lot of bots that were feeling the groove.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The convenience store clerk</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I stopped by the booth for Galbot, another Chinese company that says it is focused on multi-modal large language models and general purpose robotics. Galbot’s booth had been styled to look like a convenience store, and its bot appeared to have been synched with a menu app. A customer would come to the booth, select an item from the menu, and then the bot would go and fetch the selected merch for them. After I chose Sour Patch Kids, the bot dutifully retrieved a box off the shelf for me. According to the company’s website, the robot has been deployed in a number of real-world settings, including as an assistant <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5LSp64S8bzXlce8qhoT7vg\">at Chinese pharmacies</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The housekeeper </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creating a machine that can fold laundry has long been one of the core ambitions of the commercial robotics community. The ability to pick up a T-shirt and fold it is considered <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-folding-clothes\">a fundamental test</a> of automated competence. For that reason, I was fairly impressed by the display over at Dyna Robotics, a firm that develops advanced manipulation models for automated tasks. There, a pair of robotic arms could be seen efficiently folding laundry and placing it in a pile. A Dyna representative told me that the firm had already established partnerships with a number of hotels, gyms, and factories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of those businesses, the rep told me, is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.monsterlaundry.com/robotic-folding-laundromat/\">Monster Laundry</a>, based in Sacramento, California. Monster integrated Dyna’s shirt-folding robot into its operations late last year and now describes itself as the “first laundry center in North America to debut a state-of-the-art robotic folding system from Dyna.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dyna also has some impressive backing. It concluded an $120 million <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dyna.co/blog/dyna-robotics-closes-120m-series-a\">Series A fundraising round</a> in September that included funding from Nvidia’s NVentures, as well as from Amazon, LG, Salesforce, and Samsung.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The butler </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I also stopped by LG’s section of CES to take a look at its new home robot, CLOid. It was cute but was not the fastest bot on the block. You can read my full review of that experience <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/i-watched-lgs-new-home-robot-cloid-do-laundry-but-i-have-questions/\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
