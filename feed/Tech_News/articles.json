At the time, the company was testing the robots at a facility in South Carolina and said it took Amazon <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/new-robots-amazon-fulfillment-agentic-ai\">significantly less time to develop Blue Jay</a> — only about a year— than it did to develop its other warehouse robots, a speed the company credited to advancements in AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon spokesperson Terrance Clark told TechCrunch that Blue Jay was launched as a prototype — although that was not made clear in the company’s original press release.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use Blue Jay’s core technology for other robotics “manipulation programs” with employees who worked on Blue Jay being moved to other projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark told TechCrunch over email. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon also unveiled the Vulcan robot last year, which is used in the storage compartments of the company’s warehouses. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/amazon-debuts-a-warehouse-robot-with-a-sense-of-touch/\">Vulcan is a two-armed robot</a>, with one arm meant to rearrange and move items in a compartment while the other is equipped with a camera and suction cups to grab goods. The Vulcan can allegedly “feel” the objects that it touches and was trained on data gathered from real-world interactions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon has been developing its internal robotics program since 2012 when it purchased Kiva Systems, a robotics company whose warehouse automation technology formed the foundation of Amazon’s fulfillment operations. It surpassed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/amazon-deploys-its-1-millionth-robot-releases-generative-ai-model/\">1 million robots in its warehouses</a> last July.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The post outlines the app’s future direction.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app, which is part of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/\">the fediverse</a> — a larger, decentralized social web operating on the ActivityPub protocol — was thrust back into the spotlight when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now called X, in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/\">October 2022</a>. Since then, it has seen occasional growth spurts, but has often struggled to retain new users due to its more complicated setup. On Mastodon, you don’t simply create an account with a username and password; you also have to pick a server to join — an additional step that often confuses those new to decentralization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Mastodon sees somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million monthly active users, depending on the source. One <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mastodon.fediverse.observer/stats\">third-party tracker</a> puts the figure closer to 750,000, while another estimates as many as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fedidb.com/software/mastodon\">1 million</a>. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\">Mastodon’s own site</a> says the figure is around 785,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of its coming updates, the organization says it will try to make this onboarding process more understandable, while also promoting smaller servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To date, new users have often defaulted to picking the largest servers, but that undermines the power of a decentralized web. As the blog post notes, “Mastodon is best when communities are spread across many independent servers, each with its own character and focus.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New admin tools will help indie server operators handle maintenance and moderation duties more easily, including a feature to use external blocklists. The organization will also offer ways to set up content scanning for detecting illegal content and spam, along with other tools to reduce media storage usage by serving remote media posts through a trusted third party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Mastodon will look to bring on more content creators, including public figures, journalists, and institutions, with a series of updates to its app. To do so, it’s introducing a redesigned user profile that lets individuals showcase their work as well as an enhanced compose experience. Also in the works is a new email notification option that would allow someone to follow their updates, even if they don’t yet have a Mastodon account. That could appeal to those who want to follow newsletter writers, reporters, thought leaders, and other creators, while allowing those creators to reach a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The changes follow the rollout of other new features in recent months, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/mastodon-rolls-out-quote-posts-with-protections-to-prevent-dunking/\">Quote Posts</a>, similar to the feature on X and others, but with more user controls, and plans for its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/mastodon-is-taking-cues-from-bluesky-with-plans-for-its-own-starter-packs/\">own take on Starter Pack-style user recommendations</a>, called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/featured_collections\">Collections</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updates follow a shift in leadership at Mastodon: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/mastodon-ceo-steps-down-as-the-social-network-restructures/\">founder Eugen Rochko stepped down as CEO</a> after the platform announced its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/mastodon-announces-transition-to-nonprofit-structure/\">transition to a nonprofit structure</a> at the beginning of the year. In his place, Austria-based <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixhlatky/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Felix Hlatk</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixhlatky/\">y</a>, has taken over as executive director. In addition, Mastodon <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2026/02/administrative-updates/\">recently announced</a> it will split Hlatky’s duties with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-marius-rothermund/\">Dr. Marius Rothermund</a>, a certified German lawyer. Dr. Rothermund will primarily provide legal expertise during the restructuring, which involves three markets — the U.S., Germany, and Belgium.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The group published 2.5 gigabytes of data allegedly stolen from Figure on its leak website, where the hackers shame their victims and publish stolen data if they fail to extort the hacked companies.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

However, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/fei-fei-li-s-ai-startup-world-labs-in-funding-talks-at-5-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> a month ago suggested it was aiming to raise at a $5 billion valuation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership between World Labs and Autodesk will see the two companies collaborating to explore how World Labs’ models — AI systems that can generate and reason about immersive 3D environments — can work alongside Autodesk’s tools, and vice versa, starting with a focus on entertainment use cases. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For World Labs, Autodesk’s investment is a signal that its product has commercial appeal. The startup’s first world model product, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/fei-fei-lis-world-labs-speeds-up-the-world-model-race-with-marble-its-first-commercial-product/\">Marble</a>, released last November, lets users create editable, downloadable 3D environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk is one of the biggest developers of 3D CAD (computer-aided design) software. Its platform underpins architectural, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment workflows. That focus on the built world makes investment in advanced spatial AI a natural extension of its core business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or as Li put it in a statement: “Autodesk has long helped people think spatially and solve real-world problems and, together, we share a clear purpose: building physical AI that augments human creativity and puts more powerful tools in the hands of designers, builders, and creators.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, Autodesk will serve as an advisor to World Labs, and the two will collaborate at the “research and model level.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daron Green, Autodesk’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch the partnership is still in its early days, so the precise form it’s going to take hasn’t been determined yet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You could anticipate us consuming their models or them consuming our models in different settings,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He mused that customers might like to start with a world-model-based sketch in World Labs (say, of an office layout) and then drill down on certain design aspects (like the design of the desk), which is where Autodesk’s tech might come in. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Similarly, you might want to take an object that you’ve designed in our [platform], and put it in a context that you create through one of [World Labs’s] prompts,” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green added that data sharing is not part of the agreement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green said the two companies plan to start with media and entertainment use cases. Most companies building world models — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/i-built-marshmallow-castles-in-googles-new-ai-world-generator-project-genie/\">Google DeepMind</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/\">Runway</a> — see gaming and interactive entertainment as an initial go-to-market strategy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk already works with most major media production companies and has been training models for character animation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These are close to world models,” Green said. “They’re a characterization of an animal in the world that’s responding to physical constraints like time, maybe a terrain it needs to traverse. So there’s a physical understanding in the model, and you can see how that might be combined [with World Labs’s tech]. You’re not just animating the dog, but you’re giving it a world within which it can now interact.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership with World Labs supports Autodesk’s broader push to integrate more AI features across its software portfolio. The company is developing <a href=\"https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/news/upcoming-3d-generative-ai-foundation-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“neural CAD,”</a> a new kind of generative AI model trained on geometric data that can reason about components and entire systems. Put simply, it can generate working 3D models, not just images, with an understanding of how those designs would function in the real world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Autodesk’s neural CAD models are already being integrated into the firm’s product design and architecture products as a step toward more advanced spatial intelligence. But World Labs’ models could help extend that capability beyond individual design files toward more holistic digital representations of the physical world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Green thinks different AI systems, including large language models, world models and neural CAD, will be combined in the future to improve designs for Autodesk’s customers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If AI is to be truly useful, it must understand worlds, not just words,” Li said in the statement. “Worlds are governed by geometry, physics, and dynamics, and reconciling the semantic, spatial, and physical is the next great frontier of AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was originally published February 18, 2026 at 6 a.m. PST. It has been updated to include more details on World Labs’ raise.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The feature also lets users switch between the different formats across devices. While in the “Read &amp; Listen” mode, the text of the book is highlighted in real-time in sync with the narration.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Kindle app <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/narrationhelp/\">already offered a tool </a>that would allow readers to move between the Audible version and the ebook, when both versions had been purchased. This feature is now coming to Audible’s app for the first time. Customers will need to own both versions of the book for this to work, but discounted audiobooks will be made available to customers who own the matching ebook, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At launch, hundreds of thousands of titles will be supported by the new “Read &amp; Listen” feature, including those in English, German, Spanish, Italian, and French. Initially, the option will be offered in the U.S., with the U.K., Australia, and Germany gaining support over the next few months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To discover eligible titles, Audible will automatically identify which Kindle ebooks have audiobook matches within its app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, many customers were already reading and listening to their books without buying two versions — by having Alexa narrate their ebooks from their Kindle library. Alexa is not a professional narrator by any means, and the AI assistant’s more monotonous delivery can lead you to zone out. By offering a way to add on the audiobook for a lower price when you’ve already bought the ebook, Amazon hopes to boost book sales across formats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also claims that the combination of reading and listening can improve focus and comprehension, according to industry research and its own internal data. In addition, customers who read and listen are the most engaged, consuming nearly twice as much content per month as audiobook-only customers, Audible noted. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature may make sense for students and those learning a new language, as well as those who are trying to get through more books quickly. It’s also useful for those who regularly switch back and forth between reading and listening, and those who want the experience of the narration — particularly if a book is read by a favorite voice actor. Plus, some may simply appreciate having a narrator introduce all the characters by name, so they can learn the pronunciation without having to guess (a particularly thorny issue in fantasy novels!)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Audiobooks count as reading,” said Andy Tsao, Chief Product Officer at Audible, in a statement about the launch. “But now at Audible, you can read with your eyes too. Read &amp; Listen gives book lovers the best of both worlds. Whether you’re learning a new language, studying for school, or lost in a story’s world, you no longer have to choose one format over the other.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon notes that the new feature will not impact publishers’ royalty payments. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Once in full-screen mode, viewers can swipe up to scroll to the next video, which is reminiscent of TikTok’s popular format.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the new player aims to enhance mobile video viewing, some users argue that the update forces all videos into a cropped, full-screen view, removing the option to view content in its original aspect ratio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This UI sucks so bad. Let me just watch full-scale videos,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/leonardozerega/status/2023546551055118764?s=46\">one user said</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When another user <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/samuelbeek/status/2023543867145154787?s=46\">asked</a> which orientation is preferred, Bier confirmed that portrait is ideal. This approach mirrors broader industry trends, with vertical videos dominating platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels. Even streaming services have adopted the format, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/disney-is-launching-short-form-videos-this-year/\">Disney+ </a>being the most recent to introduce a vertical video feed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Sorry, but cropping the video incentivized people to post square videos. We are a mobile company,” he said, noting that X will stop cropping vertical content moving forward. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bier hinted that more video-focused updates are on the horizon as X doubles down on its video ambitions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of X’s update is notable, given that last month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/heres-whats-you-should-know-about-the-us-tiktok-deal/\">TikTok’s U.S. operations</a> were sold to an American investor group.

Annualized revenue refers to a business’s current revenue rate projected over a full year. The social media giant says the milestone is driven by its Snapchat+ offering, which has now surpassed 25 million subscribers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in 2022, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month/\">Snapchat+</a> gives subscribers access to exclusive and pre-release features for $3.99 per month. Following a successful launch, Snap introduced additional paid tiers beyond the core Snapchat+ subscription over the past year to further diversify its revenue streams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Snapchat+ has become one of the fastest-growing consumer subscription services globally, with subscriber growth every quarter,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/snap-1b-direct-revenue-25m-subscription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “What started as an early-access program for our most engaged Snapchatters has quickly scaled into a meaningful business—one that now represents a strong and growing revenue stream alongside our ads business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last June, Snapchat launched <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/snapchat-rolls-out-a-new-8-99-lens-subscription-tier/\">Lens+</a>, which gives users access to exclusive Lenses and AR experiences, along with the perks in the standard Snapchat+ tier, for $8.99 per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early 2025, the company launched an ad-free Snapchat+ subscription tier called Platinum for $15.99 per month. And, in a controversial move in September, Snapchat announced plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/snapchat-caps-free-memory-storage-launches-paid-storage-plans/\">cap free storage for its Memories feature</a> and launched a paid storage plan that costs $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ subscribers will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moving beyond Snapchat+, the company announced yesterday that it’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/snapchat-launches-creator-subscription-in-the-u-s/\">launching creator subscriptions</a> in alpha with select people in the U.S. Users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscriptions, which will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and an ad-free experience for that creator’s Stories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of the future, Snap says it’s going to continue to grow Snapchat+ with a focus on customization and community-driven features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/26/meta-to-test-premium-subscriptions-on-instagram-facebook-and-whatsapp/\">rival Meta is following suit</a>, as the company told TechCrunch last month that it was going to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, you could ask Gemini to create a “comical R&amp;B slow jam about a sock finding its match,” and the app will generate a 30-second track along with cover art made by Nano Banana.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that you can even upload a photo or a video, and the AI-powered tool will create a song to match the mood of the media file.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that Lyria 3 improves on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3009803/google-expands-access-to-its-lyria-music-generating-models/\">the previous generation of models</a>, creating more realistic and complex music tracks. Users can also change and control other elements like style, vocals, and tempo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with rolling out Lyria 3 to the Gemini app, Google is making the model available to YouTube creators through the Dream Track feature on YouTube, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14151606?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a tool</a> that helps creators make AI-generated tracks. The option was only available to YouTube creators in the U.S. until now. But with this release, Google is expanding Dream Track availability globally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that you can’t mimic an artist outright, but if you add an artist’s name to your prompt, Gemini will create a track in a similar style or a mood. (It’s not clear if generation will make it easier for others to decode the music style of a particular artist.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Music generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content,” the company said in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/lyria-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google noted that all songs created with the Lyria 3 model will have a SynthID watermark to identify AI-generated content. The company said that it’s also <a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16722517?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">adding capabilities to identify AI-generated music</a> with SynthID within Gemini. Users will be able to upload tracks and ask Gemini if it is AI-generated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Music generation is rolling out to all 18+ Gemini users across the world with support for English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI-generated music has created mixed sentiments among artists and listeners. On one hand, companies like YouTube and Spotify are adopting AI and signing contracts with music labels to monetize AI-generated music. On the other hand, AI model and tooling companies are facing lawsuits from the music industry over copyrights of the training material. Platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/deezer-makes-it-easier-for-rival-platforms-to-take-a-stance-against-ai-generated-music/\">Deezer have published tools to mark AI-generated music</a> to curb fraudulent streams of this kind of music.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

All the social platforms, from Facebook and Instagram to TikTok, and major incumbents like Microsoft and Google, to content-generation startups like Jasper and Copy.ai, offer AI tools that claim to make marketers’ lives easier in uncountable ways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was partly why I was confused to see yet another marketing AI startup entering the fray: San Francisco-based Kana just came out of stealth with a suite of AI agents that can do data analysis, audience targeting, campaign management, customer engagement, media planning, and optimizing for AI chatbots. The startup has raised $15 million in a seed funding round led by Mayfield. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Kana has something going for it that most marketing startups today don’t: Its co-founders, Tom Chavez (CEO; pictured above on the right) and Vivek Vaidya (CTO; pictured above on the left), have been building marketing tech for more than 25 years. Kana’s actually their fourth venture after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/14/microsoft-picks-up-another-ad-startup-rapt/\">Rapt</a> (acquired by Microsoft in 2008), <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/to-beef-up-in-marketing-tech-salesforce-is-buying-krux-for-340m-in-cash-and-stock-potentially-750m-overall/\">Krux</a> (bought by Salesforce in 2016), and startup studio <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/28/superset-startup-studio-fundraise/\">super{set}</a>, which they incubated Kana in for nine months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calling this a “wondrous” time to be building, Chavez said there was a clear opportunity to bring their experience and today’s AI tech to bear on this class of problems. “We see a market that’s crying out for solutions that meet this moment […] We understand the space deeply, having wallowed in it arguably a little too long; having really stood in our customers’ pain,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The solution, as Kana pitches it, involves “loosely coupled” AI agents that can be tailored “on the fly,” integrated into legacy marketing software, and can simultaneously work on different operations. So a marketer could, for example, upload a media brief that Kana’s agents would analyze to figure out the campaign goals, search for the audience to target, and pull in data from inventory and market research to further tweak the plan. The platform bakes in autonomous campaign tracking, optimization, and reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside agents, Kana offers synthetic data generation to augment third-party data sources for activities like market research and audience targeting. This, Chavez argued, could help companies reduce the costs of using third-party data, fill in gaps in the data, and help marketers run tests on various platforms faster and narrow down strategies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kana says this is all done while keeping humans in the loop so that marketers can approve the AI agents’ actions, give feedback, and customize what the agents do as their needs change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chavez and Vaidya emphasized the importance of the platform’s flexibility, arguing that the ability to deploy, tailor, and build new agents in real time would let marketers see results on their campaigns faster than they would with legacy systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Going forward, the startup sees that very flexibility to customize its platform for customers, doubling as its moat against incumbents and other startups building similar products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have the opportunity not to create bespoke solutions, but to highly tailor and configure these solutions to meet customers where they are. Larger companies just are never going to get there,” Chavez said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We live in a world which allows us to explore a third option [with customers]: not build, not buy, but build with — build with in a way which is supported,” Vaidya added. “We can move with insane speed that these big companies just cannot. And that’s our advantage.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kana will use the fresh cash to expand hiring across engineering, product, and go-to-market. Mayfield managing partner Navin Chaddha is joining the company’s board. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As non-humans — chatbots, AI agents, and automated systems — have proliferated on the web, so has the need to provide them with credentials, permissions, and identities. That’s one major reason identity and access management startups that help manage this new kind of digital workforce are raking in venture capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, a 35-person Israeli-American startup called Venice is emerging from stealth with fresh cash and a plucky claim: that it’s already replacing industry stalwarts like CyberArk and Okta at Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venice, founded just over two years ago, says it raised $20 million in Series A funding in December, led by IVP, with participation from Index Ventures, which led its earlier seed round. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike many of its well-funded rivals — which include Persona (raised a <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/blog/series-d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$200 million</a> Series D last April), Veza (closed a <a href=\"https://veza.com/company/press-room/series-d-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$108 million</a> Series D last May), and GitGuardian SAS (raised <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/gitguardian-raises-50-million-for-secrets-and-non-human-identity-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$50 million</a> last week) — Venice is tackling both cloud-based and on-premises environments, a technical choice that has made the product harder to build but positioned it to win over the large enterprises still running legacy systems alongside modern cloud infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At its helm sits 31-year-old Rotem Lurie, whose path to entrepreneurship pretty much ticks every box on VCs’ checklists. The daughter of two programmer parents in Israel (her mother was one of the country’s first female software engineers), Lurie spent four-and-a-half years as a lieutenant in Unit 8200, Israel’s elite intelligence corps, before joining Microsoft as a product manager working on what would become Defender for Identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She later became the first product hire at Axis Security, an access management startup that sold to Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $500 million in 2022. Just before that acquisition closed, Lurie left to join YL Ventures, a cybersecurity-focused venture firm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That brief stint at YL Ventures proved particularly instructive. “Every day, I used to meet a team of three 23-year-old boys,” Lurie says straightforwardly over a Zoom call. “Most of those companies build their technology to be acquired. The entire strategy around what problem you’re solving and how you penetrate the market — it’s a completely different approach.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To replace incumbents like CyberArk, which has long dominated the privileged access management market, Lurie realized she’d need to play a longer game. That meant building technology that’s both deep and comprehensive enough to support the complex, hybrid IT environments of most large enterprises. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technical challenge ahead of Lurie went thus: Most identity and access management teams juggle roughly 10 different tools to manage who and what has access to corporate systems. Venice’s platform consolidates that sprawl into a single system that handles privileged access across on-premises servers, SaaS applications, and cloud infrastructure for humans and non-human entities alike.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Tying everything together was what mattered to customers the most,” Lurie says. Indeed, Venice operates a SaaS subscription model, but Lurie insists it isn’t competing on price. “We reduce the cost, but it’s not because we go cheap on pricing,” she explains. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s because we spare all the overhead [associated with many of today’s offerings], especially the professional services” — the consultant fees and lengthy implementations that have become an almost unavoidable tax for enterprise security deployments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bet appears to be paying off. Lurie says Venice is now “completely replacing” legacy vendors at Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 customers, and cutting implementation time to just a week-and-a-half, from the typical six months to two years, thanks to AI-powered automation. While she declined to name customers on the record, she told TechCrunch off the record that they include a 170-year-old, publicly traded manufacturing giant as well as a global music conglomerate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cack Wilhelm, the partner at IVP who led Venice’s Series A, says Lurie stood out. “The problem with most cybersecurity pitches is everyone’s tackling something too small to ever be material,” Wilhelm says. “When you look at the massive exits — CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks — they were doing audacious things from the beginning. Rotem is the same.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wilhelm points to the urgency created by AI agents as a key factor driving IVP’s investment thesis. “If every individual is going to have tens of agents working on their behalf, and privileged access tools were built for a static world of IT professionals, we need our identity concept to adjust to that,” Wilhelm said. “Very often, when [companies] are breached, they’re breached by people simply logging in with someone else’s credentials. You solve that with just-in-time permissions that are scoped to the individual and the moment.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though crowded, the market seems eager for new solutions. Identity and access management spending was expected to exceed $24 billion in 2025, increasing by 13% from a year earlier, according to an industry group called Identity Management Institute.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venice’s team is split between Israel, where R&amp;D is based, and North America, where the go-to-market team operates. Notably, nearly half of the cybersecurity company is women, a rarity in one of tech’s most stubbornly male-dominated sectors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lurie’s co-founder, Or Vaknin, serves as CTO (he’s pictured with Lurie, above). The company’s investors include Assaf Rappaport, co-founder and CEO of Wiz, and Raaz Herzberg, CMO at Wiz and Lurie’s former colleague from their days as interns at Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Lurie, who says she has spent much of her career as “the only woman in the room,” creating a more balanced team wasn’t a calculated act. “You can never see yourself doing something if you didn’t see someone like you doing it,” she says. “This is something that attracts other women — to feel like they can be part of it.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question now is whether Venice’s two-year head start and early Fortune 500 wins will be enough to fend off deep-pocketed competitors as they chase the same enterprise buyers. Can the market support multiple winners? Or, will identity management follow the path of other security categories and consolidate around one or two dominant players?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move comes as the South Asian nation seeks to scale AI skills and build domestic capacity in one of the world’s largest talent markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Wednesday, OpenAI said it was partnering with six public and private higher-education institutions in India, including top engineering, management, medical, and design-focused institutes, with the aim of reaching more than 100,000 students, faculty, and staff over the next year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than focusing on consumer use, the initiative centers on integrating AI into core academic functions, signaling OpenAI’s interest in influencing how AI is taught, governed, and normalized within one of the world’s largest higher-education systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has already built a large consumer audience for its ChatGPT chatbot, which has over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">100 million monthly active users</a> in India, according to CEO Sam Altman, and India has emerged as the company’s second-largest user base after the U.S. The announcement also coincides with a broader push by leading AI firms to deepen their presence in India, which is hosting an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI Impact Summit</a> in New Delhi this week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first cohort of partners includes some of India’s most influential academic institutions, such as the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, alongside private universities and specialized design schools. The ChatGPT maker said the partnerships would span disciplines ranging from engineering and management to healthcare and creative fields.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has already emerged as a key testing ground for AI use in education. Last month, Google said India accounts for the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/india-is-teaching-google-how-ai-in-education-can-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highest global usage of its Gemini tools for learning</a>. Microsoft, similarly, said this week it would <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/02/17/acting-with-urgency-to-address-the-growing-ai-divide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expand its Elevate skilling program</a> in India to train teachers across schools, vocational institutes, and higher-education settings, working with government agencies as part of a broader push to build AI skills at scale.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI said the partnerships would involve campus-wide access to its ChatGPT Edu tools, faculty training, and responsible-use frameworks. The focus, the company said, is on embedding AI into core academic workflows such as coding, research, analytics, and case analysis, rather than offering standalone access to tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two of the partner institutions, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, will also introduce OpenAI-backed certifications. Additionally, OpenAI said it would work with Indian ed-tech platforms, including Physics Wallah, upGrad, and HCL GUVI, to extend AI training beyond campuses. These platforms will launch structured courses on AI fundamentals and ChatGPT use cases, aimed at students and early-career professionals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raghav Gupta, head of education at OpenAI India, said educational institutions were a “critical route” to closing the gap between rapidly advancing AI tools and how people are actually using them, as skills demands shift across the economy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, OpenAI hired Gupta, a former Coursera Asia-Pacific managing director, as its India and Asia-Pacific head of education, alongside the launch of a Learning Accelerator program focused on expanding AI skills.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The flurry of moves into education underscores how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond consumer tools and corporate clients toward institutions that shape skills, norms, and long-term adoption. For countries like India, the contest is not just around access to AI, but also about who helps define how it is taught, governed, and embedded at scale.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That user base helped push its annual recurring revenue to $4 billion by the end of year, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch on the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar. The subscription-based company also saw its B2B business, which accounts for companies with more than 25 seats, grow by 100% with $500 million in ARR. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company still sees the majority of its business from North America, with continued growth in international markets.

The company debuted a tool that lets users create <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/canva-is-adding-an-ai-assistant-coding-and-sheets-to-its-platform/\">mini apps and websites using AI last year</a>. Obrecht noted the tool has more than 10 million monthly active users now. It’s been successful enough that the company is thinking about putting AI at the center and acting like a “design agency in your pocket,” Obrecht said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That shift to AI comes as Canva faces competition from the likes of Adobe, Freepik, and Apple, which has pushed to become a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/apple-launches-creator-studio-bundle-of-apps-for-12-99-per-month/\">full-packaged creator suite</a> by bundling apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage into a $12.99 per month Creator Studio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where we started was… we got the Canva platform, and we’re giving the Canva platform a bunch of AI tools. We’re inverting that now. We’re becoming an AI platform with a bunch of design tools. So you can think of it more like a cursor for design,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Canva is also actively integrating with chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude. It said that by October 2025, users had more than 26 million conversations with the Canva app on ChatGPT.

Baglino said <a href=\"https://heronpower.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Heron Power</a> didn’t need the money, but after customers expressed interest in buying more than 40 gigawatts of solid-state transformers, it decided to raise again. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If our customers are leaning in, we need to lean in as well,” Baglino, who is CEO of Heron Power, told TechCrunch. “We gotta go faster.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The speed at which Heron Power is raising shows just how data centers are driving demand for products that can rapidly deliver electricity to their servers. Baglino, who spent nearly two decades at Tesla and led the powertrain and energy groups, is no stranger to moving quickly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Series B round was led by Andreessen Horowitz’s American Dynamism Fund and Breakthrough Energy Ventures with participation from Capricorn Investment Group, Energy Impact Partners, Gigascale Capital, and Valor Atreides AI Fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solid-state transformers have been under development for more than a decade, but only recently have matured to the point where they are ready to deploy in data centers and other large, energy-intensive facilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new technology seeks to replace old iron-core transformers, which have existed in essentially the same form for more than a century. Iron-core transformers are inexpensive and efficient, but they are bulky and generate lots of heat. Solid-state transformers are smaller and can be more efficient by replacing several pieces of equipment, solving two of data center developers’ biggest challenges.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solid-state transformers can also manage power intelligently, including from a range of electricity sources like wind, solar, and batteries, because they use semiconductors instead of passive metal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s solid-state transformers, branded as Heron Link, can convert medium-voltage electricity to the 800-volt power needed by Nvidia’s reference rack designs. They’re capable of handling 5 megawatts apiece, and each device contains tens of modules that do the power conversion. If one fails, it can be swapped out in about 10 minutes, far faster than it takes to replace a monolithic transformer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Each Heron Link also contains specialized lithium-ion batteries that can discharge quickly to provide 30 seconds of power to smooth the transition to backup power sources like grid-scale batteries, allowing data centers to eliminate uninterruptible power supplies. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By eliminating pieces of equipment, solid-state transformers also eliminate several points of failure and reduce costs. “We can remove 70% of the gear involved,” Baglino said. “For some data center applications, it might be savings of an order of magnitude.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data centers are only about a third of Heron Power’s business currently, Baglino said. The remainder is split between solar power and grid-scale batteries, which benefit from solid-state transformers’ speed and flexibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heron Power plans to use the new funding to build a factory capable of producing 40 gigawatts of Heron Link transformers annually. That’s about 10% to 15% of annual production outside of China (or about 5% to 10% of total global demand), the equivalent to half the peak power demand of the state of Texas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Baglino said the company intends to begin pilot production in early 2027 before ramping production over the following two years. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Heron Power isn’t alone in developing solid-state transformers, and with many of the grid’s old transformers approaching replacement age, competition will be stiff. The startup’s new cash haul paired with Baglino’s experience scaling production could give it an advantage. “We will push as hard as we can,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These mark a sharp upgrade from the company’s 2-billion-parameter Sarvam 1 model that it released in October 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 30-billion- and 105-billion-parameter models use a mixture-of-experts architecture, which activates only a fraction of their total parameters at a time, significantly reducing computing costs, Sarvam said. The 30B model supports a 32,000-token context window aimed at real-time conversational use, while the larger model offers a 128,000-token window for more complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3093891\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sarvam-30b.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Sarvam’s 30B model is placed against Google’s Gemma 27B and OpenAI’s GPT-OSS-20B, among other models.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sarvam</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sarvam said the new AI models were trained from scratch rather than fine-tuned on existing open source systems.

Engine Ventures led the round with ABB, Cerberus Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures, Clean Energy Ventures, Fine Structure Ventures, Helios Climate Ventures, MCJ, and Piedmont Capital participating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also recently announced a deal to provide its Interport device to Exowatt, the startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/sam-atlman-backed-exowatt-wants-to-power-ai-data-centers-with-billions-of-hot-rocks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">building solar-plus-storage containers</a> to supply data centers with 24/7 electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Interport device acts as a router for power, Subhashish Bhattacharya, co-founder and CTO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch. One Interport can handle up to 2.4 megawatts of connections. For example, it could accumulate 600 kilowatts from solar panels and 600 kilowatts from grid-scale batteries to feed power to 12 racks drawing 100 kilowatts each.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because Interport can integrate electricity from a variety of sources, including large batteries, DG Matrix says it can eliminate uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and the equipment needed to support them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altogether, one Interport can cut down the amount of space devoted to power conversion in a data center. Two 4-by-30-foot skids laden with power conversion equipment can be replaced by a single four-by-four-foot Interport device, DG Matrix co-founder and CEO Haroon Inam told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By eliminating several devices, the company can boost the system’s overall efficiency. All the legacy devices chained together can achieve about 82% to 90% efficiency, Inam said, while Interport is 95% to 98% efficient. He said that reliability should improve, too. “When you are using only 10%, 15% of the components that legacy is using, you’re going to be far more reliable,” he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DG Matrix is in the process of rolling out initial units to customers in June. Its next product will be a sidecar to supply data center racks with power that builds on the technology the company has already developed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, data centers represent about 90% of DG Matrix’s pipeline, with the remainder devoted to EV charging for fleets. Inam said the next step is to expand into building power and add more capacity to build micro- and mini-grids to support electrification projects in remote communities. There, Interports would orchestrate power from solar, wind, and batteries to provide round-the-clock electricity without a grid connection.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody’s going to build a $100 million transmission line to a village,” Inam said. “Now you can spend a fraction of that money and help eliminate energy poverty.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property against any platform that attempts to trade on the goodwill and recognition we have worked so hard to establish,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We disagree with the complaint’s assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word ‘cameo,’ and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” an OpenAI spokesperson told <a href=\"https://reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-blocked-using-cameo-name-amid-trademark-lawsuit-2026-02-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters</a> in response to the ruling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI has been involved in several intellectual property cases in recent months. Earlier this month, the company ditched “IO” branding around its upcoming hardware products, according to court documents obtained by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-drops-io-branding-hardware-devices/\">Wired</a>. In November, digital library app OverDrive sued OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-sued-infringing-library-app-makers-sora-trademark-2025-11-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over its use of “Sora”</a> for its video-generation app. The company is also in legal disputes with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/studio-ghibli-and-other-japanese-publishers-want-openai-to-stop-training-on-their-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">various artists, creatives, and media groups</a> in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/court-rules-that-openai-violated-german-copyright-law-ordered-it-to-pay-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">various geographies</a> over copyright violations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

California is Tesla’s biggest U.S. market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November 2023, the DMV filed accusations that Tesla violated state law by using deceptive marketing of Autopilot, its basic advanced driver-assistance system, as well as its more capable Full Self-Driving driver-assistance software. The state regulator argued that the terms misled customers and distorted the capabilities of the advanced driver-assistance systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla stopped using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” and instead used Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to more accurately describe the system and clarify that drivers were still required to monitor it. But Tesla held on to the Autopilot term, prompting the DMV to refer the case to an administrative law judge at the California Office of Administrative Hearings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In December, the administrative law judge agreed with the DMV’s request to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its actions. The DMV agreed with the ruling but didn’t pounce; instead, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since then, Tesla took corrective action and has stopped using the misleading term ‘Autopilot’ in the marketing of its electric vehicles in California,” the DMV stated in a release posted on its website. “Tesla had previously modified its use of the term ‘Full Self-Driving’ to clarify that driver supervision is required. By taking this prescribed action, Tesla will avoid having its dealer and manufacturer licenses suspended in the state for 30 days by the DMV.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla didn’t just stop using the term Autopilot, though. In January, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tesla-discontinues-autopilot-in-bid-to-boost-adoption-of-its-full-self-driving-software/\">discontinued Autopilot </a>in the U.S. and Canada altogether. The move not only helped it comply with the DMV but was also viewed as a way to boost adoption of FSD, which, unlike Autopilot, requires the owner to pay for the upgraded system.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FSD Supervised, which until February 14 required an $8,000 one-time fee, is now only available through a monthly subscription of $99.
