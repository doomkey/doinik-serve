These features are also available for adults, who can opt to set their own limits and reminders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For parents who also use YouTube, it can be challenging to move back and forth between an adult’s account and kid’s account — unless if you want your algorithm to be forever usurped by Bluey. In the coming weeks, YouTube says it will update the sign up experience within the app to make it easier for parents and kids to toggle between their accounts with just a few taps… of course, that requires the parent or child to actually remember to make the switch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These features build upon YouTube’s existing parental controls for teens, which include the ability to supervise a teen’s channel activity if they’re making content. This has become industry standard, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/snapchat-officially-introduces-parental-controls-through-a-new-family-center-feature/\">Snapchat</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/meta-is-rolling-out-new-parental-control-tools-for-instagram-and-messenger/\">Instagram, and Facebook</a> have similar controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, YouTube also unveiled <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/youtube-rolls-out-age-estimatation-tech-to-identify-u-s-teens-and-apply-additional-protections/\">age-estimation technology</a> to predict if an account belongs to a teen so that it can provide a more age-appropriate experience. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla is removing the option to pay a one-time fee for its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software, CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2011324998653513810\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> Wednesday. Going forward, the only way to access the feature will be through a monthly subscription.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change represents a major break from how Tesla has sold access to the advanced driver assistance suite over the years. It’s also a decision that could have an impact on Tesla’s bottom line, Musk’s ability to unlock the full value of his $1 trillion pay package, and the company’s ever-swirling legal troubles. And it comes as many other global automakers are making progress on their own advanced driver assistance systems in hopes of competing with Tesla. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has sold access to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software suite — which still does not make a car completely autonomous, and requires human supervision — at various price points over the years. The up-front price peaked at $15,000 in 2022, though more recently the company has been charging customers $8,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla started offering access to the software via a $199-per-month <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">subscription in 2021</a>, and it dropped that price to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/tesla-drops-fsd-price-to-99-per-month-in-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">just $99-per-month in 2024</a>. Musk often encouraged customers to pay the up-front price, though, as he claimed the cost of FSD would increase dramatically as Tesla added to its capabilities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But on Wednesday, Musk wrote in a post on X that Tesla will stop selling FSD outright starting on February 14. He didn’t say whether Tesla plans to change the pricing structure for the subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk also did not offer an explanation for the change, but there are a few possible reasons. Musk and other Tesla executives have spoken publicly about how the adoption rate is lower than they had hoped. In October 2025, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-full-self-driving-sales-customers-pay-fsd-2025-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said</a> only 12% of all Tesla customers have paid for FSD. Shifting to a subscription-only model with a lower up-front cost could help boost those numbers, especially during a first quarter that is expected to be rough for Tesla.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boosting subscriptions would also get Musk closer to fulfilling one of the key “product goals” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/06/musks-1t-pay-package-is-full-of-watered-down-versions-of-his-own-broken-promises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">required for him to receive the full payout</a> of his new $1 trillion pay package. The company has tasked him with, among other things, reaching “10 million active FSD subscriptions” (measured daily over a three-month period) before late 2035.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Moving to a subscription-only model could also be a legal hedge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For a decade, Musk and Tesla promoted the idea that customers were buying cars that had all the hardware required to become autonomous vehicles, and that all the company needed to do was improve the software. But that was not true: Tesla has had to make a number of upgrades inside its vehicles in the years since, and Musk himself has said that a huge portion of existing owners (those with so-called “Hardware 3” vehicles) would likely need new hardware in their cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FSD was sold under this same promise. Customers who bought the software outright would eventually get a software update that would make their cars full autonomous. Tesla has still not fulfilled that promise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla currently faces all kinds of legal trouble related to these unmet promises. In December, a judge ruled that the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-marketing-for-autopilot-and-full-self-driving-judge-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">engaged in deceptive marketing</a> around FSD (and its less-capable system, Autopilot) and ordered the California DMV (which brought the case) to suspend Tesla’s manufacturing and dealer licenses in the state for 30 days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DMV stayed the order and gave Tesla at least 60 days to comply by changing the names of those products, or ship software that delivers on the promise. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla also faces a range of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/tesla-drivers-can-pursue-class-action-over-self-driving-claims-judge-rules-2025-08-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">class action</a> lawsuits over the claims it made about the future autonomous capabilities of its vehicles. By removing the option to buy FSD outright, the company could be capping any potential liabilities in those lawsuits should they proceed to trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla’s FSD is still regarded as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-for-traffic-safety-violations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most capable driver-assistance software</a> on the market in the U.S. But the company’s success hasn’t stopped competitors from trying to develop their own systems. Rivian recently detailed its own efforts to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/rivian-goes-big-on-autonomy-with-custom-silicon-lidar-and-a-hint-at-robotaxis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">release FSD-like driver assistance software</a>, starting with a major <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/rivian-rolls-out-new-universal-hands-free-driving-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">geographic expansion</a> to its hands-free driving feature. Ford and General Motors have their own hands-free systems. And the many rival automakers Tesla competes with in China have been developing their own solutions, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/why-chinas-auto-tech-giants-threaten-teslas-self-driving-future-2025-06-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some even offering their driver assistance features as a standard option</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nicholas Leonard and Derek Caneja wanted to build AI voice agents, but when they went to build the product, they felt many of these voice agents had design flaws. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of these agents were being built with no-code tools, meaning shipping to production was fast, but the quality of the product was often low. Other agents were being made by companies that had the time and resources to spend months building specialized tools. “Developers and enterprises needed an alternative,” Leonard told TechCrunch, adding that he and Caneja also realized that the future of software would be “coded, validated, and optimized by coding agents.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These two insights and a historical realization gave us the inspiration for VoiceRun,” Leonard, the company’s CEO, said. Caneja is the company’s CTO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, they decided to launch <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://voicerun.com/\">VoiceRun, a platform</a> that lets developers and coding assistants launch and scale voice agents. Right now, many of these low-code platforms let people build voice agents with visual diagrams, where people click through conversation flows and write prompts into boxes that then dictate how the agent should behave. All of that can be hard to manage, Leonard said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">VoiceRun, on the other hand, lets users code how they want their voice agents to behave, giving them more flexibility in creating the product they want. Code is the native language of coding agents, Leonard explained. “They are going to do a far better job operating in code than in a visual interface,” Leonard said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Furthermore, with visuals, there are limited configuration options, so, for example, if someone wanted to build a voice agent that could speak in a different dialect, it might be harder to do if the maker of the visual interface didn’t build a feature that can handle that task.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“But in code, it’s incredibly simple to do,” he said. “There is a long tail of millions of examples of little things you might want to do that aren’t supported by the visual interface.” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from coding agents, VoiceRun also lets users perform A/B testing and deploy instantly with one click. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is geared toward enterprise developers, helping companies, for example, incorporate AI into their customer services, or help tech companies launch voice-based products. He mentioned, for example, working with a restaurant-tech company launching an AI phone concierge for food reservations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company announced on Wednesday the closing of a $5.5 million seed round led by Flybridge Capital. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a lot of competition in the AI agent space. Startups in this area last year nabbed billions of dollars (out of the many billions that flooded into AI companies in general). Leonard feels his company is up against two ends of the market: There are the no-code voice builders, like Bland and ReTell AI, he said, that lets user build quick demos. There are also more sophisticated tools, like LiveKt and Pipecat, which give developers “maximum control.” He feels Voicerun sits in the middle of these two ends. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“​​We provide global voice infrastructure and an evaluation-driven lifecycle, while keeping ownership of business logic code and data in the customer’s hands,” he said. “The key difference is that we are closing the loop for end-to-end coding agent development. We expect developers to be supervising coding agents that write code, run tests, deploy, and propose improvements.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some ways, Leonard is hoping his product helps developers create voice agent tools that will, in turn, help people feel more comfortable with automated voices. Customers today “feel relief” when a human answers the phone, “because voice automation has been brittle and ineffective.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A survey from Five9 <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.five9.com/news/news-releases/new-five9-study-finds-75-consumers-prefer-talking-human-customer-service\">last year showed </a>that three-fourths of its survey respondents still prefer talking to a human when it comes to customer service matters. Leonard said he wants to change this perception because “human agents today have their own limitations,” like language barriers or making people feel judged. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There were great cars before the Model T, but vehicles didn’t become ubiquitous until the assembly line,” Leonard said. “There are great voice agents today, but they won’t be ubiquitous until the voice agent factory is built. VoiceRun is that factory.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/skyfi-lets-you-order-up-fresh-satellite-imagery-in-real-time-with-a-click/\">Austin-based startup SkyFi</a> has built a platform that acts as a sort of “Getty Images” for more than 50 geospatial imagery partners that has proven popular in the worlds of finance, defense, infrastructure, and insurance — to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That popularity escalated as SkyFi began offering more analytics and insights to its customers through its website and mobile app, along with the ability to “task” satellites to capture images of a location at a specific time, CEO Luke Fischer recently told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the real goal for us is providing answers for customers, both government and commercial,” Fischer said. “Imagery is a commodity, or it’s closely becoming a commodity, [so it’s] not just about speed of delivery, but more importantly, speed of delivery of answers to customers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being able to offer insights along with easy-to-access imagery is a big reason why SkyFi was just able to close a $12.7 million Series A funding round, according to Fischer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s reflected in the investor makeup of the round. It was co-led by climate-focused fund Buoyant Ventures and IronGate Capital Advisors, which invests in dual-use companies.

The company upped its target to $10 million, and again to $12 million, before arriving at the $12.7 million figure after some strategic investors joined the round. (One was DNV; Fischer declined to name the other on the record.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fischer said SkyFi used to have a harder time convincing satellite imagery providers to hand over access to their data. Now, he said, onboarding new providers is “table stakes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It took a took a little bit for us to get to this point, [but] we have largest virtual constellation of assets. That means we have all the data supply in the world for us, all the different sensor types,” he said. SkyFi has been able to leverage all of that data and, crucially, the many requests it’s received from customers over the last few years to build up analytical offerings worth selling to commercial and government customers. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know better than anyone what they’re asking for,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fischer said he learned first-hand how powerful this kind of feedback loop can be from his time helping lead Uber’s Elevate division. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Uber has data on where people move in the world. They layer different products, the bikes, the scooters, the electric aircraft, the drone delivery. We have that equivalent data on what people are looking at in the world they’re asking of that data,” he said. “It gives us a much better purview. And again. We’re software first, so I don’t have the burden of having to pay for hardware capital expenses.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of those customers will want to do their own analytics, like the hedge funds, Fischer explained. But most are increasingly interested in what SkyFi has to offer on the insights side, he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to use the new funding to expand on all this, though Fischer is clearly proud of building a product that is deeply capable but inherently approachable, to the point that even his family uses the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My teenage daughters task satellites for their high school, and now college, homework on their iPhones,” he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

However, there are some hints contained <a href=\"https://digital.ny.gov/state-of-the-state-book-2026/#table-contents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">within a document</a> that outlines an array of proposals and promises Hochul made in her State of the State address. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among them is language to expand the state’s existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The document goes on to say companies that want to operate robotaxi services commercially will have to submit applications that “demonstrate local support for AV deployment and adherence to the highest possible safety standards.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear what “limited deployment” or “highest possible safety standards” mean. Nor does the document outline how the state will track or make judgments on a company’s safety record, except that multiple agencies will be involved, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Transportation, and New York State Police.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The governor’s office told TechCrunch more will be shared in the governor’s executive budget proposal that is set to be released on January 20.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the remarks were enough of an opening to make Alphabet-owned Waymo cheer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Governor Hochul’s proposal to legalize fully autonomous vehicles is a transformative moment for New York’s transportation system,” Justin Kintz, Waymo’s head of global public policy, said in an emailed statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With the Governor’s leadership, New York has the opportunity to pair its investments in slower speeds, better traffic enforcement, and first-in-the-nation congestion management strategies with Waymo’s demonstrably safe technology, creating a future where living in New York is safer, easier, and more accessible. We’re ready to work with leaders around the state to make this future a reality, and bring new infrastructure, career opportunities, and investment to the Empire State,” said Kintz.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo and other companies have tried for years to enter New York state with limited success. Current New York state law mandates that drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That poses a problem for robotaxi operators like Waymo since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The state’s AV pilot program has provided an exemption to that rule, theoretically allowing companies to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, there are significant hurdles, particularly in New York City. Last August, city regulators granted a permit to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the densely populated city. Under that permit, Waymo can deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn with a human safety operator behind the wheel. A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the permit has been extended until March 31.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even with the permit, Waymo can’t carry passengers or operate a commercial robotaxi service without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And while <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S2688#:~:text=2025%2DS2688%20(ACTIVE)%20%2D%20Summary,the%20operation%20of%20autonomous%20taxicabs.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">legislation was introduced</a> last year to create a framework for driverless operation, it has languished in the state Senate’s transportation committee. The governor’s proposal could help loosen that bottleneck. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-launching-its-own-ai-infrastructure-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said that</a> Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">spend billions to expand its AI capacity</a>. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/ai-data-centers-accused-creating-160043558.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">accused</a> of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/data-center-water-pollution-amazon-oregon-1235466613/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">environmental concerns</a>. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/nx-s1-5355017/data-centers-bring-money-to-small-towns-but-do-they-also-bring-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">questions around</a> the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">observed</a> that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company <a href=\"https://www.wisn.com/article/microsoft-drops-caledonia-data-center-after-community-pushback/68905827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">abandoned plans</a> for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township <a href=\"https://arcwestmichigan.com/news/local/microsoft-data-center-proposal-protest-processing-information-farm-life-community-dorr-township-allegan-county-west-michigan-infrastructure-development?photo=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have recently inspired locals</a> to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ohio-public-pays-price-big-093003806.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an op-ed</a> in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/communities/americas/ohio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">developing</a> several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-microsoft-make-changes-curb-data-center-power-costs-americans-2026-01-13/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">major changes</a>” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/trump-and-microsoft-laud-data-center-commitments-as-key-to-addressing-electricity-prices-3961528c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqd6_IWdHe0kYQxoYNNXC8LJ6OhCRB1wooYoTn3g0mEr5jkfi-TPWnfCGJ4il3o%3D&amp;gaa_ts=696693bf&amp;gaa_sig=J5QMFBFOx4fuMfYlhc-Qz7ayNiiB1exUqCNVBwv49p1En7-QYRza3SWBl7M-STYc1__FRng2NKm8Uuo3mMeOhQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trump said</a> the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank <a href=\"https://groundworkcollaborative.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Groundwork Collaborative</a>. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as <a href=\"https://x.com/owenslindsay1/status/2010764260423729309\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">well as delving into some</a> of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which <a href=\"https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/message-ceo/nrf-2026-remarks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google CEO Sundar Pichai described</a> when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a post on X, Google <a href=\"https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010852970859270341\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">responded that</a>, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents <a href=\"https://ucp.dev/specification/identity-linking/#mapping-between-resources-actions-and-capabilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">on handling a shopper’s identity</a> say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/google-avoids-breakup-but-has-to-give-up-exclusive-search-deals-in-antitrust-trial/\">Google to change a number of search business practices</a> after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like <a href=\"https://dupe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dupe</a>, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and <a href=\"https://www.joinbeni.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Beni</a>, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Without it, crops would go unfertilized and billions of people would starve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Humans started making ammonia in large amounts just over a century ago, and since then the process used to make it, known as Haber-Bosch, hasn’t changed much. A new startup, <a href=\"https://www.ammobia.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ammobia</a>, says that it has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process to lower the cost by up to 40%.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To prove the technology works on a larger scale, Ammobia has raised a $7.5 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.

Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/business/petrochemicals/ammonia-fuel-future/99/i8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as energy dense</a> and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH<sub>4</sub>) found in natural gas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate <a href=\"https://www.c-thru.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ammonia-Technical-Brief-June2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">between 1,000 and 3,000 tons</a> per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ammobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250270101A1/en?assignee=Ammobia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">patent pending</a> on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.5c00899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">manganese nitride</a>, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/amazons-ring-doorbells-get-fire-alerts-an-app-store-and-new-sensors/\">shipped</a> just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/amazons-new-alexa-feature-adds-conversational-ai-to-ring-doorbells/\">conversational AI</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">facial recognition</a> features, and more. Some of these additions have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">not been without controversy</a>, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2023, five years after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/amazon-is-buying-smart-doorbell-maker-ring/\">selling Ring to Amazon</a>, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/amazon-ring-ceo-steps-down-five-years-after-acquisition.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">needed out</a>. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3082346\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg 3777w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0539.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ring-watch-duty-jamie-siminoff-garage-burned-palisades-fire-la-2026-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">destroying the garage where Ring was built</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of Ring’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/amazons-ring-doorbells-get-fire-alerts-an-app-store-and-new-sensors/\">new additions, Fire Watch</a>, was inspired by this tragedy.

In 2024, Ring <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/ring-will-stop-sharing-video-with-police-with-some-exceptions-heres-what-it-means-for-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ended</a> an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/security/amazons-ring-cameras-push-deeper-into-police-and-government-surveillance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">companies like Flock Safety and Axon,</a> which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/19/tech/flock-safety-ai-cameras-brown-suspect-privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">surveillance cameras</a> — including <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/police-seek-ring-camera-footage-004651394.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADdUEbMhvFgfmptcTLAaYr5nRw16XsVvPa9ebjQzrL0C_i4TF_DushY0t0v_EIxsSWh4iWHOe4mwy4py6KriCn9JZo4QT8xhPuIeSRvwBJ2hjyUBgVJIe71eKiysAs0UENx9q1DyOYD-xxCI0WaMKvKGtRwgyso5aaeg58Og-XqH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ring’s</a>, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">there are</a> still <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">worries</a> about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country.

For the security-minded, this raises immediate red flags. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of a sudden there’s medical data transferring from HIPAA-compliant organizations to non-HIPAA-compliant vendors,” Itai Schwartz, co-founder of data loss prevention firm MIND, told TechCrunch. “So I’m curious to see how the regulators would approach this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the way some industry professionals see it, the cat is already out of the bag. Now, instead of Googling cold symptoms, people are talking to AI chatbots — over <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">230 million people</a> already talk to ChatGPT about their health each week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This was one of the biggest use cases of ChatGPT,” Andrew Brackin, a partner at Gradient who invests in health tech, told TechCrunch. “So it makes a lot of sense that they would want to build a more kind of private, secure, optimized version of ChatGPT for these healthcare questions.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI chatbots have a persistent problem with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\">hallucinations</a>, a particularly sensitive issue in healthcare. According to Vectara’s <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/vectara/leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Factual Consistency Evaluation Model</a>, OpenAI’s GPT-5 is more prone to hallucinations than many Google and Anthropic models. But AI companies see the potential to rectify inefficiencies in the healthcare space (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/\">Anthropic</a> also announced a health product this week).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Dr. Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, the inability of American patients to access care is more urgent than the threat of ChatGPT dispensing poor advice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Right now, you go to any health system and you want to meet the primary care doctor — the wait time will be three to six months,” Dr. Shah said. “If your choice is to wait six months for a real doctor, or talk to something that is not a doctor but can do some things for you, which would you pick?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dr. Shah thinks a clearer route to introduce AI into healthcare systems comes on the provider side, rather than the patient side. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Medical journals have <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2016-09-08-study-physicians-spend-nearly-twice-much-time-ehrdesk-work-patients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">often</a> <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/pubs/fpm/issues/2023/0700/relieving-admin-burden.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that administrative tasks can consume about half of a primary care physician’s time, which slashes the number of patients they can see in a given day. If that kind of work could be automated, doctors would be able to see more patients, perhaps reducing the need for people to use tools like ChatGPT Health without additional input from a real doctor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dr. Shah leads a team at Stanford that is developing <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/ai/stanford-pilots-chatehr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ChatEHR</a>, a software that is built into the electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing clinicians to interact with a patient’s medical records in a more streamlined, efficient manner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Making the electronic medical record more user friendly means physicians can spend less time scouring every nook and cranny of it for the information they need,” Dr. Sneha Jain, an early tester of ChatEHR, said in a Stanford Medicine <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/06/chatehr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">article</a>. “ChatEHR can help them get that information up front so they can spend time on what matters — talking to patients and figuring out what’s going on.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is also working on AI products that can be used on the clinician and insurer sides, rather than just its public-facing Claude chatbot. This week, Anthropic announced <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/\">Claude for Healthcare</a> by explaining how it could be used to reduce the time spent on tedious administrative tasks, like submitting prior authorization requests to insurance providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Some of you see hundreds, thousands of these prior authorization cases a week,” said Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger in a recent presentation at J.P. Morgan’s <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/about-us/events-conferences/health-care-conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Healthcare Conference</a>. “So imagine cutting 20, 30 minutes out of each of them — it’s a dramatic time savings.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI and medicine become more intertwined, there’s an inescapable tension between the two worlds — a doctor’s primary incentive is to help their patients, while tech companies are ultimately accountable to their shareholders, even if their intentions are noble.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that tension is an important one,” Dr. Bari said. “Patients rely on us to be cynical and conservative in order to protect them.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The video allows Neo robots to learn new tasks they weren’t previously trained on, according to 1X.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This release comes as 1X is gearing up to release its Neo humanoids into the home. The company opened up <a href=\"https://www.1x.tech/neo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">preorders for its humanoids</a> in October with plans to ship the bots this year. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“After years of developing our world model and making Neo’s design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. “With the ability to transform any prompt into new actions — even without prior examples — this marks the starting point of Neo’s ability to teach itself to master nearly anything you could think to ask.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Saying that the bot can transform <em>any prompt</em> into a new action is a lofty claim and not entirely accurate; you can’t tell a Neo to drive a car and it will suddenly know how to parallel park, for instance. But there is some learning going on. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">1X isn’t saying the world model allows today’s Neo bots to do a new task right away from capturing video and being prompted, a company spokesperson clarified. Instead, the bot takes video data linked to specific prompts and then sends that back into the world model. That model is then fed back into the network of bots to give them a better understanding of the physical world and more know-how. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It also gives users insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt. That kind of behavioral information could help 1X train these models to a point where robots will be able to react to a prompt of something they’ve never done before.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These companies have also hired armies of delivery personnel as competition heats up in the country’s booming e-commerce space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pressure on workers has intensified as the sector has grown. On New Year’s Eve, more than 200,000 gig workers staged protests across major Indian cities during the peak delivery period, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3339617/gig-workers-strike-india-spurs-debate-human-cost-delivery-race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to the South China Morning Post</a>, citing the Indian Federation of App Based Transport Workers. The workers demanded legislative protection, social security benefits, better wages, and changes to automated penalty systems that reduce their ratings for late deliveries. Safety concerns have emerged around workers rushing through traffic to meet delivery deadlines. “Ultra-fast delivery models of 10-15 minutes materially change the risk and stress profile of gig work,” Prabir Jha, founder and CEO of the HR consultancy Prabir Jha People Advisory, told the outlet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amid the worker protests and pressure from the labor ministry, Blinkit has removed messaging that promised deliveries within 10 minutes, and its rivals are also expected to follow suit, Bloomberg said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes little more than a month after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/indias-gig-workers-win-legal-status-but-access-to-social-security-remains-elusive/\">India granted legal status</a> to millions of gig and platform workers under new labor laws that define gig and platform workers in statute, and require aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1% to 2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s gig economy employed about 7.7 million workers in 2020-21 and is projected to reach 23.5 million by 2029-30, according to government think tank NITI Aayog.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swiggy, Blinkit, and Zepto did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, <a href=\"https://deepgram.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Deepgram</a> said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup’s raise continues the trend of sizable funding rounds in voice AI last year, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/sesame-the-conversational-ai-startup-from-oculus-founders-raises-250m-and-launches-beta/\">Sesame’s $250 million Series B</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elevenlabs-raises-180-million-in-series-c-funding-at-3-3-billion-valuation/\">ElevenLab’s $180 million Series C</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/paris-based-ai-voice-startup-gradium-nabs-70m-seed/\">Gradium’s $70 million seed round</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In 2024, when we were talking to enterprises about how they were thinking about using AI inside their business, we started to hear about them using voice AI in processes like contact centers and sales developments. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that’s what led us to them [Deepgram],” de Saint-Aignan said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She noted that voice AI could help in making customers’ interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deepgram has a bunch of models related to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/deepgrams-aura-gives-ai-agents-a-voice/\">text-to-speech</a> and speech-to-text, along with platforms and APIs for conversational speech recognition and interruption handling with low latency. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s CEO, Scott Stephenson, said that the company didn’t need the fundraise and it was cashflow positive last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. We see that we can make larger investment sooner in order to accelerate growth. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We weren’t out looking for a raise, though. We had multiple people coming to us. We wanted strategic investors who understand voice AI and the technical intricacies of it and have relationships with companies building using the technology.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company wants to use the new fundraising to expand its global footprint and better support multiple languages. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y Combinator-backed OfOne, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick-service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">withdrew its voice AI experiment</a> after a person ordered 18,000 water cups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. There have been a lot of sour interactions with voice AI over the last 20 years, where a lot of assistants have come out, and people felt that those didn’t provide a magical experience. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne’s acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl’s Jr., picked up <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260108472215/en/Presto-Adds-%2410M-to-Accelerate-AI-Leadership-for-Enterprise-QSR-Brands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$10 million in new funding</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://market.us/report/voice-ai-agents-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Analysts’ </a><a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-voice-generators-market-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reports</a> peg the voice market to grow at over 30% year-over-year and become a $14-$20 billion market by 2030.

And Salesforce CTO Parker Harris hopes it will be as viral as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cloud software giant rolled out the new version of Slackbot on Tuesday. This new AI agent version of Slackbot, which is generally available for Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, can find information, draft emails, and schedule meetings, among other things, all within the Slack platform, according to the company. It can also connect to, and interact with, other enterprise products like Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to find information if it’s granted permission. This allows users to work across a handful of different common enterprise applications without leaving Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce, and its enterprise software competitors, are pouring resources into the development of AI products in a bid to preserve, and even grow, their market share. The remodeled Slackbot, which was originally announced at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/salesforce-announces-agentforce-360-as-enterprise-ai-competition-heats-up/\">Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference</a> in October, is just one piece of Salesforce’s enterprise AI-heavy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/salesforce-announces-agentforce-360-as-enterprise-ai-competition-heats-up/\">product plan</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harris told TechCrunch the next-gen Slackbot is completely different than what existed before; the company kept the name because it is already well known.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harris added that Slack doesn’t generally release new features. Instead, Slack typically issues updates to the product to help drive adoption, which makes Slackbot quite different from past product updates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is an agent, it is a super agent that is your employee agent,” Harris said. “It’s powered by generative AI, and it is something that is highly crafted and highly curated to be an agentic experience that employees and users love.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Salesforce tests new products, like Slackbot, with its employees for months before they release them — Harris joked they like to drink their own champagne first. Slackbot has been the most adopted internal tool they’ve released, he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Just seeing the sheer active user count is a great sign we have hit on product-market-fit,” Harris said about internal adoption. “Adopted, not mandated, in corporations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is just the beginning of Slackbot’s second bloom as an AI agent, Harris said. In the future, they want Slackbot to move beyond just a text-based agent only in Slack. He said they want to add voice capabilities in the future and the ability for Slackbot to browse the internet alongside its users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I am very confident that investing in Slackbot is not only good for Slack, it will be incredibly good for the entire company,” Harris said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company’s software uses computer vision to track bird movement and migration patterns, minimizing damage from wind turbines on local bird populations. This benefits both biodiversity and wind farm developers, which face strict regulations around their impact on birds — regulations that can delay construction or even shut down projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Webb and co-founder and managing director Tom Quigley described their introduction as “kismet” to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/13/superorganism-wants-to-be-the-conservationist-on-the-cap-table/\">TechCrunch back in 2023</a>. Webb had begun making angel investments focused on biodiversity to see if it could be viable as a venture capital fund strategy. While he was doing this, he reached out to Quigley because he was impressed with his background. The two started talking and eventually began working on the firm in 2022.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The political climate around protecting nature and the climate in general has changed a lot — in the U.S. at least — since the pair started working on this a few years ago. But it didn’t really hold the firm back from reaching its $25 million target.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quigley said some potential LPs needed guidance in understanding what makes Superorganism different than a climate fund, but that becomes clearer when you look at the firm’s portfolio, he said. Their portfolio companies span different categories and attract different types of follow-on investors and customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are purposely building a diverse portfolio,” Quigley said. “It allows us to show what the best biodiversity companies look like across all industries, across all tech types. We think that there’s a showcase portfolio for a fund — one that’s a really powerful thing, and it’s a really stable portfolio that’s not too [affected] by different headwinds in different industries or different government policies of the day.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of these biodiversity issues transcend partisan battles over climate change too, he said. Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis recently gave a shout out to <a href=\"https://www.inversaleathers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Inversa</a>, one of Superorganism’s portfolio companies that <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/governor-ron-desantis-highlights-success-everglades-python-removal-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">turns invasive species into leather goods</a>, for helping tackle a python problem in the Everglades, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thus far, the firm has invested in 20 companies and plans for a portfolio size of about 35 companies for this fund.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We recognize that we’re the first and we need to be there to sort of bring others along where they might be interested in taking their first bet on biodiversity, helping them find and support the right ones that can move the needle,” Quigley said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
