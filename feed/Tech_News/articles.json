This time, it’s Gemini Space Station Inc., the New York-based crypto exchange and custodian bank founded by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The outfit, which plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GEMI, was founded in 2014 and operates as an exchange and custodian that offers a number of products and services, including a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin and a credit card that offers rewards in crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2055592/000110465925079323/tm255912-12_drsa.htm\">S-1 document</a>, which was filed Friday after markets closed, provides a look at its finances. The upshot: Gemini appears to have widening net losses. The company reported a net loss of $158.5 million on $142.2 million in revenue in 2024. Net losses in the first six months of 2025 havw already exceeded that number. Gemini reported a net loss of $282.5 million on $67.9 million in revenue in the six months ending June 30.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini is the latest crypto company to turn to the public markets as the regulatory environment has eased and the Trump administration has embraced digital currencies and other crypto assets. <br><br>In June, Circle Internet Group raised $1.2 billion in an IPO. The company, one of the world’s largest issuers of USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, had a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/circle-ipo-soars-giving-hope-to-more-startups-waiting-to-go-public/\">blockbuster debut </a>with its stock trading 168% above its IPO price of $31 set the previous day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, despite higher revenue than a year earlier, Circle reported a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/circle-internet-group-crcl-q2-earnings-report-stock-crypto-2025-df03698a\">quarterly loss</a> due to one-time costs associated with that June public offering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, crypto exchange Bullish, which also owns media outlet CoinDesk, raised $1.1 billion in its IPO. Bullish, led by former president of the NYSE Tom Farley, saw its shares more than double from its $37 IPO price to peak at $118.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok is preparing an update to its Community Guidelines, which dictate the rules for participating on the social video platform as well as what standards the company uses to determine the videos that make it onto its For You feed. While the update largely rewrites the original text for simplicity’s sake, there are a few items that jump out in the new revision — notably how TikTok prioritizes its marketplace, how deeply it personalizes the experience per user, and a small change to the type of AI-generated content that’s permitted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, social media companies have to comply with a range of regulations globally, like the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.’s TAKE IT DOWN Act, which in part has led to policy revisions on some platforms, as with yesterday’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/bluesky-rolls-out-massive-revamp-to-policies-and-community-guidelines/\">update to Bluesky</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok’s changes, which go live on September 13, 2025, are not as substantial, as it appears the company was often just rewriting text for clarity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, one section that saw several additions in the updated guidelines covers the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2025H2update#2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rules for TikTok LIVE creators.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company warns creators they’re responsible for anything that happens on their live session, even if it involves third-party tools, like real-time translation or voice-to-text tools to read out viewers’ comments. TikTok advises creators to monitor those tools to make sure they’re not violating the rules through these third-party services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another notable addition to this section introduces new guidelines for commercial content. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok stresses that commercial content must be disclosed. It also directly states that it will reduce the visibility of content that directs users to “purchase products off-platform in markets where TikTok Shop is available.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also says it’s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2025H2update#3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">customizing users’ search results</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the prior version of the guidelines said TikTok provided “search suggestions” that were relevant to the user, the new guidelines say both “search results and recommendations may look different for everyone.” The guidelines explain that TikTok uses information like your past searches and what you’ve watched to make the search results more relevant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated rules reveal that <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/accounts-features?cgversion=2025H2update#5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">comments</a> are personalized, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok says comments are being sorted based on signals like past replies, likes, and reports. Again, this means the comment section will look different from user to user.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authenticity?cgversion=2025H2update#3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">section on AI content</a> has not changed dramatically, though the language here has become less verbose in parts when describing what sort of deepfake content is not allowed. TikTok previously banned content that “shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts,” it said. “This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s now been replaced with language that says TikTok doesn’t allow content “that’s misleading about matters of public importance or harmful to individuals.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s interesting to note the language referencing AI endorsements was removed. (Perhaps TikTok is paving the way for celebrity-approved, AI-generated endorsements?)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some cases, the language in the guidelines has been simplified, such as in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards?cgversion=2025H2update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">For You feed (FYF) Eligibility Standards section</a>, which no longer has <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/fyf-standards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a long list of what’s considered FYF ineligible</a> content. Instead, details about the ineligible content are spread throughout the many different sections of the updated Community Guidelines, which makes it less helpful to reference since it’s no longer all in one place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also worth noting that TikTok changed the language explaining the reason why it engages in content moderation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before, the company said the process kept the platform “safe, trustworthy, and vibrant.” Now it describes content moderation as helping TikTok be a “safe, fun, and creative place for everyone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems “trustworthy” got the ax. <em>Uh-oh. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It also instructs the Federal Aviation Administration, which is housed under the DOT, to eliminate or accelerate environmental reviews, ease the path to building new spaceports, and to appoint a “senior executive” charged with fostering “innovation and deregulation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Commerce Department also has been ordered to stand up a new process for authorizing “novel space activities,” like in-space manufacturing or satellite refueling, that don’t fit neatly into existing licensing regimes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The executive order came the same day transportation secretary and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/faa-removes-membership-of-space-transportation-advisory-committee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dismissed every member</a> of the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC), a long-standing industry advisory board inside the DOT that shapes spaceflight rules and priorities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For companies that have spent years mired in environmental reviews and licensing delays, the order was a welcome sign that future bids would experience shorter timelines and more regulatory clarity. The Commercial Space Federation, an industry trade group whose members include SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and a dozen others, applauded the executive order for providing “regulatory relief to unleash the U.S. commercial space industry.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, commercial players are poised to gain a lot under this new regime. Launch companies could benefit from faster permitting and streamlined environmental reviews. State-backed spaceport operators, like <a href=\"https://www.spaceflorida.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Space Florida</a>, may also be aided by provisions that accelerate new site development.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creating a mission authorization framework for “novel” space activities is equally consequential: startups like <a href=\"https://www.varda.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Varda Space Industries</a> or Orbit Fab, which are developing technologies to manufacture pharmaceuticals in space and in-orbit refueling, respectively, may gain an advantage by a regulatory approach led by Commerce.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-environmental-rule-sticking-point\">Environmental rule sticking point</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Not everyone is celebrating the order. The Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), an environmental group that has challenged the FAA’s approval of SpaceX’s Starship program in Texas, called the order “reckless.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bending the knee to powerful corporations by allowing federal agencies to ignore bedrock environmental laws is incredibly dangerous and puts all of us in harm’s way. This is clearly not in the public interest,” senior attorney Jared Margolis said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For groups like CBD, environmental reviews are not “overly complex,” as the Order charges — they are often completely insufficient. In 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/01/faa-failed-to-fully-assess-environmental-effects-of-starship-lawsuit-alleges/\">environmental groups, including the CBD, alleged</a> that the FAA’s environmental assessment of SpaceX’s South Texas plans were inadequate and in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has separately waged <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/10/spacex-calls-out-superfluous-regulatory-delays-holding-up-starship-flights/\">an increasingly public campaign</a> against “superfluous” regulations and environmental analyses that have hindered a speedier test campaign.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are still some unknowns. Legal challenges to the order could slow progress, and the new COMSTAC members, who have yet to be appointed, will inform the future of space rule-making.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The lawsuit notes that 20% of these users are under the age of 8, whereas another 20% are between the ages of 9 and 12.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana,” Murrill said in a <a href=\"https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement</a>. “Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the lawsuit, adults can pose as children on Roblox, and children can bypass age requirements to access experiences meant for older users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit points to several sexually explicit experiences that were on the platform, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party,” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for Roblox said that while the company can’t comment on pending litigation, the platform dedicates “substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing,” the spokesperson said. “The safety of our community is a top priority.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Roblox <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/roblox-adds-new-safety-measures-to-ban-kids-under-13-from-social-spaces/\">launched a number of safety measures</a> to protect children on its platform, including barring users under the age of 13 from sending direct messages. The measures were implemented <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">following reports</a> that <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Roblox was exposing young users</a> to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Murrill’s lawsuit states that Roblox’s recent safety measures were implemented too late and are inadequate. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit seeks permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting the company from claiming that it has adequate safety features and from engaging in any activity that would violate the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The basic design of the phones will likely remain similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also expected to stay the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some areas where the Pro models may see improvement are camera and video quality, along with battery size, which could allow for faster charging and could address the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, there is talk that the Pixel 10 series could support <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/758906/pixel-10-qi2-charging-pixelsnap-case-leak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Qi2 wireless charging</a>. If true, this means it would be one of the few Android phones to work with magnetic accessories, such as chargers, wallets, and mounts. Google is also reportedly launching a “Pixelsnap” phone case with a magnetic ring in the center.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pixel-10-pro-fold\">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for Google’s upcoming foldable, there are rumors suggesting it’ll have a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Additionally, Google is reportedly enhancing the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are expected to be thinner for a sleek appearance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another exciting rumor is the possibility of an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/if-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-gets-this-rumored-upgrade-ill-recommend-it-over-any-other-folding-phone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IP68 rating</a>, a first for the device. This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold will likely be powered by the new G5 chip and include the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system might also receive improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone should also likely get a bump in battery life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pixel 10 may come in Moonstone and Jade colors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-pixel-watch-and-pixel-buds\">The Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Pixel Watch 3\" class=\"wp-image-2836129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg 3798w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1200,663 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1280,707 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=430,238 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=720,398 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=900,497 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=800,442 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=2048,1131 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=668,369 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=1117,617 1117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=708,391 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/loss-of-pulse.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wearables will also get their time to shine at Google’s event, with the Pixel Watch 4 rumored to get a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s also a strong likelihood that the smartwatch will introduce new health and fitness-tracking capabilities, possibly including an upgraded <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/07/18/pixel-watch-4-tipped-to-include-continuous-blood-oxygen-satellite-comms-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring</a> function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1940848330839654705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Leaks</a> of the Pixel Buds 2a indicate that the earbuds will come in new colors (Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry) along with <a href=\"https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953839487055720951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">features</a> like active noise cancellation.
