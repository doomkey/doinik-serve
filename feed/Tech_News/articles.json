            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube on Tuesday announced it’s beginning to roll out age estimation technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in order to provide a more age-appropriate experience. The company says it will use a variety of signals to determine the users’ possible age, regardless of what the user entered as their birthday when they signed up for an account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When YouTube identifies a user as a teen, it <span>intr</span>oduces new protections and experiences, which include disabling personalized advertising, safeguards that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/youtubes-new-teen-safeguards-limit-repeated-viewing-of-some-video-topics-and-more/\">limit repetitive viewing</a> of certain types of content, and enabling <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/48055830/bedtime-reminders-other-features-to-help-you-manage-screen-time?hl=en\">digital wellbeing tools</a> such as screen time and bedtime reminders, among others.   </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These protections already exist on YouTube, but have only been applied to those who verified themselves as teens, not those who may have withheld their real age. For instance, in 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/youtubes-new-teen-safeguards-limit-repeated-viewing-of-some-video-topics-and-more/\">YouTube began limiting repeated viewing of videos</a> that could trigger body image issues or those that display social aggression. The company has also been developing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/\">digital wellbeing tools since 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the new system incorrectly identifies a user as under 18 when they are not, YouTube says the user will be given the option to verify their age with a credit card, government ID, or selfie. Only users who have been directly verified through this method or whose age has been inferred to be over 18 will be able to view the age-restricted content on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The machine learning-powered technology will begin to roll out over the next few weeks to a small set of U.S. users and will then be monitored before rolling out more widely, the company says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plans to introduce age inference technology were <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-big-bets-for-2025/\">first announced in February</a> as part of YouTube’s 2025 roadmap. The plans are also the latest step in attempting to make YouTube safer for younger users, following the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-kids/\">2015 launch of the YouTube Kids app</a> and the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/a-collaborative-approach-to-teen-supervision-on-youtube/\">2024 rollout of supervised accounts</a>. The features also arrive as social media more broadly is coming under increased government scrutiny in the United States, where platform makers, including Apple and Google, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-25/meta-clashes-with-apple-google-over-child-age-check-legislation\">have pitted their lobbyists against those from big tech companies</a> like Meta over who’s responsible for age verification and children’s safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, a handful of U.S. states have taken matters into their own hands, as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_age_verification_laws_in_the_United_States\">over a dozen</a> states have passed or proposed laws to regulate minors’ use of social media. Many of these require age verification or parental consent, including those in Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Utah, Texas, Maryland, Tennessee, Connecticut, among others. (However, some laws, like those in Utah and Arkansas, are blocked by litigation at this time and are not enforceable, while others are still pending implementation.) </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.K. also began enforcing its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/u-k-starts-enforcing-online-age-check-rules/\">own age verification checks</a> this week following the 2023 passing of the Online Safety Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube isn’t sharing specifics about the signals it’s using to infer a user’s age, but notes that it will look at some data like the YouTube activity and the longevity of a user’s account to make a determination if the user is under 18. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new system will apply only to signed-in users, as signed-out users already cannot access age-restricted content, and will be available across platforms, including web, mobile, and connected TV.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The Boring Company and local officials will now begin a “public process to evaluate potential routes, engage community stakeholders, and finalize plans for the project’s initial 10-mile phase.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Construction won’t begin until the project clears the approvals process. But the governor’s office said the first segment of the loop could be operational as “early as fall of 2026.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If that happens, Nashville would become the second city where The Boring Company has opened such a system, with the first being Las Vegas. The company has spent the last few years in Sin City digging and opening tunnels around the Las Vegas Convention Center, and claims to have given 3 million rides in Teslas to date.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk launched The Boring Company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/elon-musk-doesnt-just-want-to-bore-tunnels-he-wants-to-make-boring-better/\">in early 2017</a> (after publicly noodling about the idea on Twitter while stuck in traffic in late 2016), and it has taken many forms since then. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The original video detailing Musk’s idea — now set to private on YouTube — showed vehicles getting removed from surface street gridlock by an elevator-meets-sled system and lowered into a three-dimensional underground network of tunnels. Musk also claimed during the first Trump administration that The Boring Company had received “verbal govt approval” to dig tunnels from New York City to Washington, D.C. that, leveraging hyperloop technology, could make the trip in just 29 minutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">None of that ever happened. The Boring Company abandoned plans to dig a major tunnel system underneath <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737488/boring-company-los-angeles-map-tunnels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the greater Los Angeles area</a> after pushback from locals. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236075/elon-musk-chicago-boring-company-tunnel-politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">similar thing happened in Chicago</a>. And the Boring Company has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-boring-company-tunnel-traffic-11669658396?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhfvMIXMbeiC55gLg73wrgyCcOXRL3f0FVR-EWU-4pIfdr3q13zGHUhfzekY18%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6888d934&amp;gaa_sig=IRGHAhqL20ytOkZQLuePilNsoc3Mmmp0_wCVJQnQCrjXXoJX3YrzYPV_ecIYHGxqogF5Tbp9UkA7h5anONPIWw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">essentially ghosted many other cities around the country</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea of the hyperloop, which Musk admitted to biographer Ashlee Vance came from his <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/22/hyperloop-one-elon-musk-high-speed-rail/\">hatred of California’s high-speed rail system</a>, was also cast aside. Even the Teslas that traverse the Las Vegas tunnels are being driven by humans, despite Musk’s obsession with self-driving cars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, The Boring Company now more closely resembles a glorified convention center people-mover, although there are some potential benefits to its approach versus the typical monorail setup. Construction should be less disruptive to Nashville’s daily traffic. And, in its current form at least, it’s not costing taxpayers money.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the Tennessee governor’s office cites The Boring Company’s safety record in Las Vegas in the announcement — the loop “recently earned a 99.57% safety and security rating” from the Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration, according to the press release — it is careful not to mention the trouble that Musk’s tunnel-digging effort has experienced during construction. (The governor’s office could not be reached for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/spacex-worker-injury-rates-at-starbase-outpace-industry-rivals/\">other Musk companies</a>, the pace at which The Boring Company operates — the same speed that the Tennessee governor’s office praised in its announcement — has been a concern for some of its workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, Fortune’s Jessica Mathews <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that a Boring Company employee told his then-safety manager: “I have watched my friends get injured due to the fast pace we’ve been running… I refuse to be the first fatality in this company’s history. No tunnel is worth a single person’s life.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That same safety manager even spoke to Fortune on the record, saying: “The conditions they were told to work in were honestly almost unbearable … I couldn’t fix any of the things that were wrong.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Dorsey says he coded the basis of the app over the course of a weekend in early July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bitchat operates through Bluetooth mesh networks, which means that users can send messages to others within the range of Bluetooth connectivity — usually around 100 meters — without cell reception or a Wi-Fi connection. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app’s UX is very minimal. There is no log-in system, and you’re immediately brought to an instant messaging box, where you can see what nearby users are saying (if anyone is actually around you and using the app) and set your display name, which can be changed at any time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Bitchat is sparking interest due to Dorsey’s reputation, the concept of Bluetooth-powered messaging apps is not new. These apps are also popular in settings like large music festivals, where cell service may be limited, or in the aftermath of natural disasters, where cell service and Wi-Fi availability may be impacted. The Bluetooth messaging app <a href=\"https://bridgefy.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bridgefy</a> was notably used during pro-democracy <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49565587\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">protests</a> in Hong Kong, since its ability to function without the internet made it harder for authorities to detect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey advertised Bitchat as a secure, private messaging platform when it went live for beta use earlier this month. But security researcher Alex Radocea <a href=\"https://www.supernetworks.org/pages/blog/agentic-insecurity-vibes-on-bitchat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pointed out in a blog post</a> that it’s easy to impersonate other people within Bitchat, calling into question how secure the “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/vibe-coding/\">vibe-coded</a>” app really is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In cryptography, details matter,” Radocea wrote. “A protocol that has the right vibes can have fundamental substance flaws that compromise everything it claims to protect.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey later admitted that the software had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/jack-dorsey-says-his-secure-new-bitchat-app-has-not-been-tested-for-security/\">not been subject to an external security review</a> and thus may contain vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bitchat’s concerns around impersonation also extend to the app itself. As of now, the app can be downloaded for iOS via the App Store, or it can be loaded onto an Android device by <a href=\"https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat-android/releases/tag/0.8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">downloading the app from GitHub</a>. However, the Google Play store hosts multiple apps that appear to be pretending to be Dorsey’s app, which have garnered thousands of downloads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dorsey has not directly addressed the fake Bitchat apps on the Google Play store, but he did repost <a href=\"https://x.com/callebtc/status/1949950406995374379\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">another user’s X post</a> that said that Bitchat is not yet on Google Play, and to “beware of fakes.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If the deal goes through, it would clear a key hurdle in OpenAI’s transition toward becoming a fully commercial enterprise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies have been negotiating regularly, and they could come to an agreement in a few weeks, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/microsoft-s-access-to-openai-tech-is-focus-of-contract-talks?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg reports</a>, citing three anonymous sources. The report cited some of the sources as saying that while the talks have been positive, other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/ex-openai-staff-file-amicus-brief-opposing-the-companys-for-profit-transition/\">roadblocks</a> could emerge in the form of regulatory scrutiny and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/09/musk-may-still-have-a-chance-to-thwart-openais-for-profit-conversion/\">Elon Musk’s lawsuit</a> to block OpenAI’s for-profit transition. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/openai-reverses-course-says-its-nonprofit-will-remain-in-control-of-its-business-operations/\">currently structured</a> as a mission-driven nonprofit that oversees a capped for-profit company — a setup that’s meant to limit how fully it can commercialize or raise money. That structure hasn’t stopped it from raising billions and operating like a traditional tech company, but OpenAI still wants to shake off its constraints. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest backer with $13.75 billion invested and rights to some of the ChatGPT maker’s IP, has put up meaningful roadblocks to OpenAI’s future as a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/openai-may-pay-its-nonprofit-arm-billions-of-dollars-in-conversion-to-for-profit/\">for-profit company</a>, with talks dragging on for months. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft wants a bigger stake in the restructured company and seeks to secure its access to OpenAI’s tech beyond the current deal, which ends in 2030 or whenever OpenAI says it has achieved AGI — though no one can really agree on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/even-the-godmother-of-ai-has-no-idea-what-agi-is/\">what that means</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft has built its Azure OpenAI Service around the smaller company’s models, and has integrated the startup’s tech into Copilot across Windows, Office, and GitHub. If OpenAI suddenly declares it has achieved AGI and cuts off access, Microsoft would lose a huge strategic advantage. The ChatGPT maker has reportedly also told its investors that it expects to pay Microsoft <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/openai-expects-to-cut-share-of-revenue-it-pays-microsoft-by-2030/\">a lower share of its revenue</a> as it progresses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A source told Bloomberg that OpenAI also hopes to guarantee that Microsoft deploys OpenAI’s technology safely, especially as it nears AGI. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft also stands to gain from OpenAI becoming a for-profit company. The current setup caps investor returns, so a more standard structure would give Microsoft a chance to receive formal equity and significant returns, in addition to access to OpenAI’s tech. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bloomberg reports that the two companies have been negotiating an equity stake for Microsoft in the low- to mid-30% range.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

Many manufacturers opt for skim milk to cut costs, which allows them to add oils to meet nutritional requirements. Several formulas contain palm oil, soy, and corn syrup, which aren’t recommended for infants due to their potential health risks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35998087/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">research</a> has linked corn syrup to an increased risk of obesity, while palm oil has been shown to <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/111/5/1017/63328/Reduced-Bone-Mineralization-in-Infants-Fed-Palm?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">decrease calcium and fat absorption</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I became fixated by the fact that there wasn’t a good, organic infant formula that I trusted, that I wanted to feed my daughter in the United States, which is a first-world country,” Hallam told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the past seven years, Hallam has been developing her own organic, whole-milk infant formula from scratch, with the help of scientists and pediatric nutritionists. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today marks the official launch of <a href=\"http://nara.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nara Organics</a>, which meets both European and U.S. safety standards, and is FDA-registered and USDA-certified. Most importantly, the formula is free from palm oil, soy, corn syrup, maltodextrin, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), providing a clean option for conscientious parents looking to nourish their babies with the best possible ingredients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nara Organics claims to have the highest percentage of milk fat of any formula sold in the U.S. It also has the lowest percentage of plant-based oils, as the use of whole milk means that less oil is needed to achieve the correct fat content. The ingredient list on the package includes an “organic vegetable oil blend” made up of organic sunflower, coconut, and rapeseed oils, which provide essential fatty acids that support healthy development.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031686\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_Organics.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nara Organics</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While there are several brands with organic formulas, such as Bobbie and ByHeart, these products are manufactured in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In contrast, Nara Organics chose not to produce its formula in American facilities, potentially due to previous issues with Cronobacter contamination, a germ that can survive in dry foods. In recent years, there have been <a href=\"https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2023/03/20/voluntary-recall-certain-gerber-good-start-soothepro-powdered-infant-formula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">several </a>recalls of<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cronobacter/outbreaks/source-date/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> baby formula </a>linked to outbreaks of Cronobacter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is why the company prefers to manufacture its formula in Germany, which just so happens to be the birthplace of powdered infant formula. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chief marketing officer Meika Hollender explained to TechCrunch that the company’s manufacturing partner utilizes technology “that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A critical piece of infant formula, in terms of its shelf life, is how much oxygen gets into the can while you’re sealing it. So if you go to facilities in the U.S., they’re open. When you’re filling, canning, and sealing the can, they’re just sort of out in the open air of the facility. And at our facility, the cans actually go into this chamber that has no oxygen in them,” Hollender said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nara has secured a total of $32 million from AlleyCorp, BBG Ventures, Corazon Ventures, Gingerbread Capital, and Torch Capital. Additionally, the company has attracted attention from high-profile celebrity investors, including tennis superstar Serena Williams, “Jane the Virgin” actress Gina Rodriguez, and the creators of “Nobody Wants This,” <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/foster-sisters-explain-why-they-havent-invested-in-ai/\">Erin and Sara Foster</a>, among others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nicky Hilton, fashion designer and philanthropist, is also an investor and advisor.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I breastfed all of my three children, but they also all had formula,” Hilton told us. “Every baby and parent is different, and not all mothers are able to breastfeed due to medical, physical, or personal reasons. I think there’s so much judgment and unnecessary pressure about breastfeeding… It’s really exciting to be a part of an innovative brand that is disrupting the baby formula market.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With this support, Nara Organics could position itself as a key player in the organic formula market, which was valued at approximately <a href=\"https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/organic-infant-formula-market-2807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$20.7 billion</a> in 2023 and is expected to reach $37 billion by 2032.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031687\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nara_PG.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Nara Organics</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The formula is now available for purchase on the company’s website.

Instead, smaller companies may be thwarted by a multi-layered, expensive bureaucratic process used to ensure a company can meet security and other compliance requirements. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, Golden Dome may not be the zero-sum battle of emerging tech versus incumbents. The startups that do breakthrough will be those that are able to convince the biggest defense contractors to take them on as subcontractors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency released last week <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/f250fd59d7914ea19277e6fd9606c4ad/view\">a draft solicitation</a> for a $151 billion, multi-award contract, the prelude to the government’s forthcoming defense tech-buying spree.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 10-year contract, called SHIELD, or Scalable Homeland Enterprise Layered Defense, acts as an umbrella that will be used to buy technology for the Golden Dome system. That program, which the White House likened to Israel’s Iron Dome, will encompass systems that span space, land, and sea to protect the continental United States against a variety of missile threats. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In order to build out this system, the government will be looking to purchase a range of cutting-edge technology, like space-based interceptors, ground-based radars, and terrestrial and sea-based systems capable of taking out an enemy missile in flight. The first hurdle for companies hoping to win one of the contracts is to qualify for the umbrella program, or vehicle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Getting onto the $151 billion vehicle doesn’t guarantee federal dollars; instead, companies will compete for contracting work on individual task orders. The final request for proposals will be released sometime in the fourth quarter of this year, though<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/musks-spacex-is-frontrunner-build-trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield-2025-04-17/\"> that hasn’t stopped companies from already starting their lobbying efforts.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bryce Dabbs, CEO of consulting firm Approach Venture, told TechCrunch that he estimates between 5% and 10% of the pot could realistically go to non-traditional vendors – not by startups competing as a prime contractor, but rather through “teaming and subcontracting arrangements,” he said, noting that not all startups are equal. For instance, SpaceX and Anduril, while backed by venture capital, are already at the scale of small primes, and the opportunity for smaller startups will likely look considerably different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A startup with a compelling technology would need to collaborate with a defense prime, like Northrop Grumman or Lockheed, to provide a capability that the prime doesn’t currently offer in-house.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s because many early-stage companies lack facility clearances, personnel, IT security, or other requirements to perform highly classified government work – and the pre-solicitation warned that these barriers to entry will be in place for would-be suppliers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Venture-backed companies like Anduril and SpaceX will be able to meet these security and compliance requirements, but everyone else will likely need to sub under a prime in order to compete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dabbs said his firm is seeing more early-stage founders reference Golden Dome in their decks, and that the program is frequently referenced when VCs do diligence on startups Approach supports. But the investors “may not fully understand how government procurement or larger contracts work,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, more mature and cash-rich startups like SpaceX and Anduril are better poised to compete with the legacy defense contractors, also sometimes called, such RTX (formerly Raytheon), Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and L3 Harris. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/musks-spacex-is-frontrunner-build-trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield-2025-04-17/\">Reuters reported</a> earlier this year that a team composed of SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril has already started meeting with federal officials. Lockheed, meanwhile, launched a “Golden Dome for America” page on its website highlighting how it might contribute to the effort.   </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-far-not-fair\"><strong>FAR, not fair</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">William Greenwalt, senior fellow at American Enterprise Institute and former deputy undersecretary of defense industrial policy at the DOD, was less optimistic. “I am not overwhelmed by the prospects for non-traditionals to gain anything at all from this,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s because of the structure of the contract, which is being run under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While FAR requires “full and open competition,” the pathway’s high compliance standards implicitly keep newcomers out. Instead, Greenwalt said the program should be done as an Other Transaction Authority (OTA), which gives the DOD more flexibility to work with non-traditional vendors and fund prototypes with follow-on production opportunities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A CICA IDIQ contract is about the dumbest way to do this if you want innovation as it will preclude non-traditionals from bidding. This should be done as an OTA — plain and simple,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trump appointed General Michael Guetlein, second in command of the U.S. Space Force, to spearhead the initiative. He will be in charge of finalizing the program’s final architecture, which the White House wants to be in place in just three short years. That timeline favors technologies that are ready to be deployed now, not still being worked out in R&amp;D labs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Golden Dome is a bold and aggressive approach to hurry up and protect the homeland from our adversaries,” he said in May.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said today that it is rolling out an image upscaling feature, an object blending, and an upgraded object remover to Photoshop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said that the Generative Upscale feature will enhance an image up to 8 megapixels. This is useful for restoring details to old photos, upscaling images for prints, or adopting assets for various platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, Adobe teased a feature called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.adobe.com/max/2024/sessions/project-perfect-blend-gs3-7.html\">Project Perfect Blend</a>, which works on correcting colors, shadows, and lighting for newly added objects to an image. The idea is to have the new object, such as a sofa chair in a room, blend in with the environment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Adobe is rolling out this feature under the Harmonize moniker, letting you place an object in a scene, remove its background, and have Photoshop use Firefly models to adjust color, lighting, shadows, and visual tones to fit the object in the scene. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also rolling out an improved object removal tool. Previously, when you used generative fill to remove the object, the tool considered the whole scene to fill in the gap of the removed object and at times, that resulted in unwanted artifacts in the image. The company has reworked the algorithm to have it focus on just removing the object and filling the gap with the background. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a demo seen by TechCrunch, when Adobe’s director for product management at Photoshop, Joel Baer, tried to remove a small bowl of Pico de Gallo from a picture with an earlier version of object removal, the tool just added a green blob. The new version was able to successfully remove the object and replace it with the background.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe is also adding a few small features to Photoshop, including a better way to manage putting assets in a shared and organized space. Plus, the company lets you choose the version of the Firefly model you want to choose while using AI features. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have talked to photographers, designers, and content creators to understand what are the pain points in their workflows and what slows them down. These new features will help them save time, remove friction from their workflows, and take on some of the time-consuming tasks on their behalf,” Shambhavi Kadam, senior director of product management for Photoshop, said in a briefing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Generative Upscale, Harmonize, and improved object removal features are available in beta for Photoshop on desktop and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/28/adobe-launches-photoshops-web-version-with-firefly-powered-ai-tools/\">web</a> versions. The Harmonize feature is also available on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/25/adobe-launches-a-photoshop-iphone-app/\">the new Photoshop iOS app</a> through an early access program. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While he said he can’t discuss specifics due to confidentiality agreements, the technologies he co-developed at Apple’s secretive division clearly helped inform what Delian is building.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the heart of autonomy is perception,” Kottas explained, describing how machines must understand not just where objects are but what they’re doing and what they intend to do. “This lies at the heart of autonomy, and given autonomy is going to be at the heart of all future weapon systems, that’s the core technology that’s going to drive change in the defense industry over the next decade.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031843\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png 1372w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=1200,624 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=1280,666 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=430,224 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=720,375 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=900,468 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=800,416 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=668,348 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=1186,617 1186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=708,368 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.13.47PM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It wasn’t just technological insight that drove his career change, though. A series of geopolitical events — watching the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict; seeing countries look to revise their surrounding borders; and recognizing how far behind European militaries had fallen — had begun gnawing at him. “I literally lost sleep,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than attempting to build the next-generation fighter jet, Kottas began with something pragmatic that he could sell more immediately: surveillance towers. The move was seemingly ripped from the playbook of eight-year-old weapons maker Anduril, which started off with software-augmented surveillance towers that it sold to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Delian’s newer products reveal bigger ambitions. The “Interceptigon” series features concealed autonomous aerial and sea drones and vessels designed to lie dormant until threats appear. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most striking example is a two-meter suicide vessel that comes packed in a cylinder and is deployable months in advance on the seabed at depths where satellites and drones can’t detect it. When remotely activated, it appears “out of nowhere to the enemy,” Kottas told TechCrunch, adding that Delian has patented this approach, which uses commercial materials to manufacture the weapons at “large scale and really at extremely low cost.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a model that Kottas says doesn’t exist elsewhere in the Western defense industry. It has also attracted investors who just provided Delian with $14 million in funding. Indeed, the startup announced on Tuesday that its earlier backers, Air Street Capital and Marathon Venture Capital, have led its newest capital infusion, which brings Delian’s total funding to date to $22 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s where Kottas’ story gets more complicated. Despite Delian’s technological achievements and operational success in Greece, the broader European market remains a formidable challenge. U.S. officials have reportedly been <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-officials-object-european-push-buy-weapons-locally-2025-04-02/\">pressuring</a> European countries to continue buying weapons from U.S. outfits. Further, European countries have long favored their homegrown defense companies, a tendency that some investors believe will make it difficult for startups like Delian to scale across borders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That concern is stronger right now in France,” Kottas acknowledged, though he argued the landscape is changing. And as evidence that fragmentation is being overcome, he pointed to European Union initiatives like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.safe-europe.eu/\">Safe</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2025/769566/EPRS_BRI(2025)769566_EN.pdf\">ReARM Europe</a>, designed to encourage cross-border defense cooperation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The proof, he insisted, is already emerging, with companies like Portugal’s Tekever achieving <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nif.fund/news/nato-innovation-fund-backed-tekever-becomes-europes-newest-unicorn/\">unicorn status</a>, and Germany’s Quantum Systems competing globally. “There are companies that raised […] a tenth of what their U.S. competitors raised, and they competed on the exact same market, and the European counterpart won.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031848\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png 2268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=768,301 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=680,267 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=1200,471 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=1280,502 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=430,169 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=720,283 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=900,353 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=800,314 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=1536,603 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=2048,804 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=668,262 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=1440,565 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=708,278 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-1.16.01PM.png?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Naturally, the question is what Kottas thinks of Anduril, and the founder is respectful, though not intimidated. “It’s definitely a generational company that is going to inspire many founders and military officers all across the planet,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he cautioned against assuming early winners. “Where we stand right now, it’s like 2015 for self-driving cars […] Imagine trying to predict the winner back then.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the question remains whether a Greek startup — no matter how innovative — can convince French, German or British defense establishments to bet their national security on foreign technology. Kottas recently submitted a bid for a German tender, a test case for his thesis that a decentralized Europe can be overcome through superior technology and competitive pricing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, what may set Kottas apart from many defense tech entrepreneurs is how personal the mission feels. Referring to U.S. aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin, Kottas reflected that it’s “different to build weapons in New Mexico that are going to be used on the other side of the planet,” he reflects. “That’s one mindset, [but] it’s different to build something that you know may be used to save your brother or your sister or your neighbor.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This sentiment may prove Delian’s greatest asset, as it’s shared by entrepreneurs across Europe who view conflict not as an abstract possibility but as a lived reality. It drives the company’s focus on low-cost, rapidly deployable systems that can be churned out at scale, and explains its emphasis on tech that can be pre-positioned and activated when needed. It might also ultimately convince other European nations that geography matters more than nationality when it comes to defense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Either way, Kottas’ unconventional journey from Athens to Minneapolis to Apple and back to Athens suggests he’s comfortable with long odds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a “benefit of building a company” in a smaller market on a continent known for its balkanization. “It forces you to be more resilient, more efficient, and to focus ruthlessly on building great technology at a really low price point, which matters in this business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I do think fragmentation will be overcome in the coming years, and you can turn it to your advantage if you play it right.”<br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company made headlines in 2023 for becoming one of the first sex toy makers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/lovense-chatgpt-pleasure-companion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to integrate ChatGPT into its products</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the inherent security risks in connecting sex toys to the internet can put users at risk of real-world harm if something goes wrong, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/qiui-smart-chastity-sex-toy-security-flaw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">device lock-ins</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/02/smart-chastity-cage-emails-passwords-location/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">data privacy leaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">BobDaHacker said they discovered that Lovense was leaking other people’s email addresses while using the app. Although other users’ email addresses were not visible to users in the app, anyone using a network analysis tool to inspect the data flowing in and out of the app would see the other user’s email address when interacting with them, such as muting them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By modifying the network request from a logged-in account, BobDaHacker said they could associate any Lovense username with their registered email address, potentially exposing any customer who has signed up to Lovense with an identifiable email address.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This was especially bad for cam models who share their usernames publicly but obviously don’t want their personal emails exposed,” BobDaHacker wrote in their blog post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch verified this bug by creating a new account on Lovense and asking BobDaHacker to reveal our registered email address, which they did in about a minute. By automating the process with a computer script, the researcher said they could obtain a user’s email address in less than a second.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">BobDaHacker said a second vulnerability allowed them to take over any Lovense user’s account using just their email address, which could be derived from the earlier bug. This bug lets anyone create authentication tokens for accessing a Lovense account without needing a password, allowing an attacker to remotely control the account as if they were the real user. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Cam models use these tools for work, so this was a huge deal. Literally anyone could take over any account just by knowing the email address,” said BobDaHacker. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bugs affect anyone with a Lovense account or device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">BobDaHacker disclosed the bugs to Lovense on March 26 via the <a href=\"https://internetofdon.gs/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Internet of Dongs</a>, a project that aims to improve the security and privacy of sex toys, and helps <a href=\"https://internetofdon.gs/lovense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">report and disclose flaws to device makers</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to BobDaHacker, they were awarded a total of $3,000 via bug bounty site HackerOne. But after several weeks of back and forth disputing whether the bugs were actually fixed, the researcher went public this week after Lovense requested 14 months to fix the flaws. (Security researchers typically grant vendors three months or less to fix a security bug before going public with their findings.) The company told BobDaHacker in the same email that it decided against a “faster, one-month fix,” which would have required forcing customers using older products to upgrade their apps immediately.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The researcher notified the company ahead of disclosure, per an email seen by TechCrunch. BobDaHacker said in a blog post update on Tuesday that the bug may have been identified by another researcher as far back as September 2023, but the bug was allegedly closed without a fix. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovense did not respond to an email from TechCrunch sent prior to publication. After we published, a Lovense representative said the account takeover bug “has now been fully addressed,” and that the email disclosure bug will be patched in an update expected to be “pushed to all users within the next week.” The representative would not commit to publicly notifying its customers about the bugs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated with comment from Lovense.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company delivers different plans to cater to various health goals. The company’s founder, Ahmed Al Rawi, told TechCrunch the startup’s revenue grew by “close to 100%.” Calo delivered more than 10 million meals last year in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain. While Al Rawi didn’t provide a number for this year, he said the deliveries were growing in step with revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those numbers, along with its brand, technology, and operational excellence, convinced Aljazira Capital to invest in the Saudi company. “Calo represents a compelling opportunity at the intersection of healthtech, foodtech, and consumer subscription models,” Rawan AlRasheed, director of venture capital at Aljazira Capital, told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup is also making moves to expand in the UK, where last year it acquired two meal delivery services, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.freshfitnessfood.com/\">Fresh Fitness Food</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://detoxkitchen.co.uk/\">Detox Kitchen</a>. While Fresh Fitness Food didn’t raise any money, Detox Kitchen had raised just over $3.4 million via a mix of venture-backed and equity crowdfunding rounds, according to Crunchbase data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We spoke to over 50 meal subscription businesses worldwide, ranging from the U.S. to Asia, in 2023-24 to learn about what is an exciting market for us to expand to. We realized the UK was the right market for us to expand. We thought that both companies that we acquired had a great culture fit to work with Calo,” Al Rawi told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that Calo acquired these businesses because they had their operational layer figured out, and the startup just wanted to upscale the tech and branding layer. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Al Rawi said Calo spent most of this year integrating its technology and process with both UK platforms without laying off any of the existing personnel. The startup finished the integration work in July and has been slowly making a marketing push in the UK. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Calo can currently deliver meals in London daily and in other parts of the UK two to three times a week. The founder said that Calo is targeting to get to 10x its revenue in the UK in the next three years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those UK ambitions will be met with competition. Apart from traditional food delivery giants like Just Eat and Deliveroo, Calo will also compete with meal-box services such as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/gousto-a-uk-meal-kit-service-raises-another-41m-as-business-booms-under-lockdown/\">Gusto</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wickedkitchen.com/\">Wicked Kitchen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Calo is focused on growing in the UK, the company is also looking to acquire different meal-kit services across the world. The company is also expanding physical locations, including retail stores and kiosks in other regions. The company has also partnered with a gym chain called Armah Sports Company in Saudi Arabia to offer a bundle of Calo and gym subscription.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

As part of the deal, LG Innotek will invest up to $50 million in Aeva, acquiring an equity stake of about 6% in the U.S. company.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The first part of the partnership is focused on the automotive sector,” Aeva’s co-founder and CEO Soroush Salehian told TechCrunch. “LG Innotek will act as our manufacturing partner for some of the top 10 global passenger vehicle OEMs.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2017, Aeva says it has poured nearly half a billion dollars into developing what it calls “4D lidar on a chip.” Unlike conventional lidar systems that rely on time-of-flight measurements to estimate distance, Aeva’s frequency modulated continuous wave-based perception technology measures both distance and velocity for every pixel in real time, Salehian said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s like going from black-and-white to color camera. We get this velocity information as a new dimension,” he explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aeva says it has integrated the entire lidar system, including optics, into a silicon photonics module. This miniaturized, chip-scale design enables more efficient production and integration, particularly for scaling in markets such as automotive, robotics, and consumer electronics, Salehian said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company plans to put the capital from the deal toward product development and augmenting its team. “Over the past eight years, we’ve made [the hardware] super small, and we’re sticking to that trajectory. We’re going to make it down to a monolithic, single-chip,” Salehian said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aeva is also targeting the manufacturing sector and has struck partnerships Nikon in Japan and CKG in Germany.

Even with functionality similar to that found in ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, Julius has carved out its own niche. The company said it has more than 2 million users and generates more than 10 million visualizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The easiest way to use Julius is to just talk to it,” Sonwalkar told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “You can talk to the AI like you would talk to an analyst on your team, and the AI, like a human, would go run the code and do the analysis for you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Questions that Julius can answer and present in a chart include: “Can you visualize how revenue and net income correlate for different industries in China versus US?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Julius’ specialization in data science even caught the eye of Harvard Business School (HBS) professor Iavor Bojinov last year. Bojinov was so impressed he asked Sonwalkar to modify Julius specifically for HBS’ new required course called <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/news/articles/Pages/mba-ai-course.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Data Science and AI for Leaders</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“People told us you’re not going to succeed,” Sonwalkar said about building a product that’s similar to features available from the foundational model companies.  “What we found was that being focused on a use case is really important.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While going through YC, Sonwalkar also masterminded a viral prank. The morning after Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X), reporters encountered two men with boxes outside the company’s headquarters. One of the two men was Sonwalkar, who introduced himself as a recently laid-off Twitter engineer “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428775/twitter-fake-employee-layoff-rahul-ligma-elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Rahul Ligma</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite some notoriety gained from the stunt, Sonwalkar insists that his startup is a lot more attention-worthy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I don’t think many people know me for that anymore,” he told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. “I get recognized for Julius a lot more now.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Avis will handle general depot operations, including charging and maintaining the vehicles. Users will be able to hail a robotaxi through the Waymo app.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo has partnered with other companies before, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/waymo-robotaxis-will-be-on-the-uber-app-in-austin-atlanta-in-early-2025/\">Uber in Austin and Atlanta</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/waymo-outsources-fleet-operations-to-african-fintech-moove-in-phoenix-and-miami/\">Moove in Phoenix</a>. Avis is the first rental car company to help Waymo manage its fleet. And it’s a partnership that will likely extend to other cities in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli said Avis will play a large in role helping the company scale its technology to new markets faster and more cost-effectively. He added that Waymo and Avis Budget Group intend to expand to more cities together over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Close followers of Waymo may not be surprised by the Dallas launch announcement. Earlier this year, Waymo took one of its “road trips” to Dallas, where the company used its sensor-laden vehicles to map the city and conduct initial testing. Since then, Waymo has started testing its autonomous vehicles on public roads with a human safety operator behind the wheel. As it has in every other city it has launched in, Waymo will progress to fully autonomous testing once its tech has been further validated on Dallas streets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bonelli wouldn’t disclose precise launch dates or how many vehicles would be in the initial robotaxi fleet. He did say Waymo will scale the fleet with Avis to hundreds of vehicles over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Avis Budget Group CEO Brian Choi said the partnership marks a “pivotal milestone in its evolution, from a rental car company to a leading provider of fleet management, infrastructure and operations to the broader mobility ecosystem.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Waymo operates commercially in five cities: Austin, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/uber-and-waymos-commercial-robotaxi-service-is-open-for-business-in-atlanta/\">Atlanta</a>, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area, which extends into Silicon Valley.

Harmonic is focused on creating “mathematical superintelligence” or MSI; the startup eventually wants to help users with all fields that rely on math, including physics, statistics, and computer science.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Aristotle] is the first product available to people that does reasoning and formally verifies the output,” said Harmonic CEO and co-founder Tudor Achim in an interview with TechCrunch. “Within the domains that Aristotle supports, which are quantitative reasoning domains, we actually do guarantee that there’s no hallucinations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eventually, Harmonic says it also plans to release an API to let enterprises access Aristotle, as well as a web app for consumers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harmonic says Aristotle achieved gold medal performance on the 2025 International Math Olympiad (IMO) through a formal test (meaning the problems were translated into a machine‑readable format). Google and OpenAI also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/openai-and-google-outdo-the-mathletes-but-not-each-other/\">developed AI models that achieved gold medal performance on this year’s IMO</a>, but through informal tests taken in natural language. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harmonic says it’s not releasing other benchmarks for Aristotle at this time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The beta launch of Aristotle comes just a few weeks since Harmonic raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Kleiner Perkins at an $875 million valuation. Achim claims that Harmonic is “advancing very rapidly along” its path to achieving MSI and that investors believed that was a fair valuation given the scope of his startup’s ambition.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several leading tech companies are focused on training their AI models to solve math problems. AI that can do math is valuable in its own right, but math is also considered a uniquely verifiable domain that demands core reasoning skills. Systems that develop these capabilities may prove useful in other domains as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Achim says that Harmonic achieves its hyper-accurate solutions by having Aristotle produce responses in the open source programming language Lean. Before Aristotle gives an answer to users, he says the model double-checks that the solution is correct through an algorithmic process that doesn’t involve AI. Harmonic’s CEO notes that similar technology is used to verify outputs in high-stakes fields such as medical devices and aviation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even in a narrow domain, achieving hallucination-free performance from an AI model is an incredibly difficult task. Studies have found that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/study-suggests-that-even-the-best-ai-models-hallucinate-a-bunch/\">even leading AI models hallucinate a lot</a>, and the problem doesn’t appear to be getting better. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/\">OpenAI’s latest AI reasoning models hallucinate more than its older ones</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The idea is that the AI can become a helper that can understand what the user is researching, predict what they want to do, and then take action on their behalf.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">How well it works in practice remains to be seen, but Microsoft notes that Copilot Mode is still considered an experimental feature. It’s also opt-in by default during these tests and is currently free for any Mac or PC users with <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/supported-regions-and-languages-in-microsoft-copilot-26de43a1-c176-4908-bef7-29c8c37ac7ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">access to Copilot</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are a few main components to Copilot Mode at launch, with more on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once enabled, Edge users will be presented with a new tab page where they can search, chat, and navigate the web with Copilot’s assistance. When visiting a specific web page, they can also turn to Copilot for more help. For example, Microsoft shows how someone might ask the AI companion if a recipe they’re viewing could be made vegan instead, and Copilot suggests substitutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This type of question is something users might ask an AI chatbot today, but this saves the step of having to paste in the content they want to reference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Or, someone could just ask the AI to simply present the recipe itself so they can skip reading through the “life story” that now accompanies so many online recipes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3031678\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/imgi_6_maxresdefault.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Microsoft</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Microsoft claims that Copilot can handle a variety of tasks on a user’s behalf, like booking appointments, creating shopping lists, and drafting content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This “agentic” use of the web is the next big leap <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/as-the-browser-wars-heat-up-here-are-the-hottest-alternatives-to-chrome-and-safari-in-2025/\">in the AI browser race,</a> but it’s unclear if consumer adoption will naturally follow. The goal, of course, is to make it easier to perform everyday tasks, like reserving a room on Booking.com or a flight via Kayak. However, chatting back-and-forth with an AI to go through the options and your needs isn’t necessarily better or faster than just doing it yourself, depending on your familiarity with the website in question.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Copilot does allow for voice input, which could be handy for people who aren’t as tech-savvy when it comes to booking things online, or for those who have limited mobility. (Later on, Microsoft says users will be able to give Copilot the additional context it needs, like credentials or history, to manage more advanced actions, like bookings. For now, it’s a bit more manual.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more interesting, perhaps, is Copilot’s ability to be a research companion. With the user’s permission, Copilot can view all open tabs to understand what the person is browsing. This could be useful if they’re doing some type of product comparison or online research, like pricing flights or hotels across multiple sites. Again, these are use cases for AI chatbots, but baking it into the browser could speed up the process of translating the user’s needs to the digital helper.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the future, Copilot will also prompt people to pick up where they left off on a project or something they’re researching, by recommending next steps, Microsoft says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company stresses that Copilot will only be able to access someone’s browsing content when they choose to allow it, and this will be made transparent to the end user with visual cues. However, the idea that you can now toggle on or off a feature that’s able to view and listen to you while you search could leave some people unsettled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
