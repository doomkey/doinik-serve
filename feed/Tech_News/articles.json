The expansion, which starts next week, will be gradual, the company says, noting it may take months for the full rollout to complete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly praised the social app and X rival, which has now grown to over 400 million monthly active users, as the company’s next big hit. Shortly after the app’s debut, the exec told investors that Threads had a good chance of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/26/zuckerberg-says-threads-has-a-good-chance-of-reaching-1-billion-users-in-a-few-years/\">reaching 1 billion users</a> in a few years’ time. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app has rapidly grown since its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/threads-passes-2-million-downloads-in-2-hours/\">July 2023 debut</a>, reaching <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/02/metas-threads-cross-200-million-active-users/\">200 million users</a> by mid-2024, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/threads-adds-another-20m-users-since-december-reaching-320m/\">320 million as of January 2025</a>, and then adding <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/threads-tops-350m-monthly-users-after-adding-30m-in-the-quarter/\">another</a> 30 million as of last April, before reaching its latest milestone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Though Threads hasn’t yet hit that milestone, the company has been testing ads for some time. A year ago, Threads began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/threads-is-testing-ads-in-the-u-s-and-japan/\">testing ads in the U.S. and Japan</a>, and last April, the platform <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/metas-threads-opens-up-ads-to-global-advertisers/\">opened up to global advertisers</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has made it easy for existing advertisers to expand their reach to include Threads by allowing them to automatically place ads through both Meta’s Advantage+ program and via manual campaigns. Supported formats include image and video, ads, including the newer additions of the 4:5 aspect ratio format and carousel ads. Advertisers can manage their Threads ads alongside those for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in their Business Settings, which simplifies cross-posting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Meta expanded the third-party verification already available on Facebook and Instagram (including feed and Reels) to the Threads feed through Meta Business Partners. This provides advertisers with independent brand safety and suitability verification for Threads — a useful feature when Threads’ nearest rival is dealing with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">scourge of illegal deepfakes</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company didn’t share how often users would see ads in their feed, but noted that ad delivery initially would remain “low” as the feature scaled to global users. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Soon, viewers will finally have the chance to watch any content they choose. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​In his <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/the-future-of-youtube-2026/\">annual letter</a> published on Wednesday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan revealed that the platform will soon introduce a “fully customizable multiview” experience. This upgrade aims to provide greater personalization by letting viewers create their own multiview layouts, tailoring their screens to their individual interests across sports, news, entertainment, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​YouTube TV first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/youtube-tv-launches-early-access-to-a-multiview-feature-for-watching-four-streams-at-once/\">rolled out</a> the multiview feature for sports broadcasts in 2023, allowing fans to watch multiple games simultaneously. The feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/youtube-tvs-multiview-feature-now-offers-non-sports-content/\">later expanded</a> to include other categories, such as news and weather, though it was initially restricted to a set list of preselected channels, including CNN, MSNBC, HGTV, and Food Network. Later on, YouTube TV began testing a way for a small group of users to customize which channels they wanted to watch side by side without restriction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new capability is expected to appeal to families and larger households with diverse viewing preferences, as it allows different genres to be watched together on a single screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​To try out multiview, press the down button on your remote, then look for the Multiview icon or the “Watch Multiview” option, and select it. From there, you can pick up to three more live channels to add to your screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">​Additionally, Mohan highlighted YouTube TV’s upcoming launch of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/youtube-tv-to-launch-genre-based-subscription-plans-in-2026/\">genre-specific channel packages</a>, designed to give subscribers more flexibility over what content they pay for. For example, viewers can choose specialized packages focused on sports, news, family programming, or entertainment, tailoring their subscriptions to their interests and potentially saving on costs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, YouTube TV hasn’t shared much about these packages, like how much they’ll cost or when they’ll launch. We can likely expect more information to be announced in the coming months as the platform prepares for rollout.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Users have posted more than 5.2 million responses, creating enough buzz to spill over onto other platforms. On Spotify, user-generated “2016” playlists have increased <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTlZI36EY2I/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=MXkwNmRqMnA2cW1ycQ==\">790%</a> since the new year, and the company now boasts in its Instagram bio that it’s “romanticizing 2016 again.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In fairness, 2016 does seem like a simpler time. Donald Trump had not yet served a day in the White House, no one knew the difference between an N-95 and a KN-95 mask, and Twitter was still called Twitter. It was the year of “Pokémon Go Summer.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But as often happens, the nostalgia skims over a lot of the anxiety that was already palpable at the time. When meme librarian Amanda Brennan searched her archives for the images that defined 2016, she showed me a screenshot that surprised me, given the internet’s current obsession with the year. The post reads, “Can’t believe that the devil put all of his energy into 2016,” with another user adding, “It’s like he had an assignment due January 1, 2017 and forgot until now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I forgot how much everyone hated 2016 at the time. It was the year of Brexit, the culmination of the Syrian Civil War, the Zika virus, and the Pulse Nightclub shooting, to name a just a few sources of dread. It wasn’t just the election of Donald Trump — months before that catastrophic night, a Slate columnist <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2016/07/is_2016_the_worst_year_in_history.html#:~:text=When%20news%20of%20the,year%20while%20it's%20still%20unfolding?\">sincerely posed the question</a> of how bad 2016 was when compared with notoriously awful years like 1348, when the Black Death took hold, or 1943, the height of the Holocaust.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084266\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png 1078w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=300,239 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=768,611 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=680,541 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=430,342 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=720,573 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=900,716 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=800,637 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=668,532 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=471,375 471w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=775,617 775w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=667,531 667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-6.24.52-PM.png?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tumblr</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The start of a new year is fertile grounds for nostalgia. The internet thrives on this kind of engagement bait, to the point that Facebook, Snapchat, and even the built-in Apple Photos app constantly remind us what we were doing a year ago. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This time around, though, our nostalgia feels different, and it’s not just political. As AI increasingly encroaches on everything we do on the internet, 2016 also represents a moment before The Algorithm™ took over, when “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys\">enshitification</a>” had not yet reached the point of no return.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To better understand the state of the internet in 2016, Brennan suggests viewing it as the ten year anniversary of 2006, when the social internet definitively cemented itself in our lives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In 2006, technology changed. Twitter was launched, Google bought YouTube, Facebook started allowing anyone above 13 to register,” Brennan told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before social platforms, the internet was a place for people who looked online for a sense of community — people who were “for lack of a better term, nerdy,” as Brennan puts it. But when social media took off, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/internet-is-leaking\">the internet began leaking</a>, and the barrier between pop culture and internet culture began to erode.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“By 2016, you will see that ten years of time has let people evolve, and people who necessarily were not internet nerds to begin with maybe ended up on 4chan, and all of these smaller little places where previously, they had been made of internet people, versus people who are not as online,” she said. “But also, because of phones, everyone is kind of an internet person now.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By Brennan’s estimation, it makes sense that 2016 was the year that Pepe the Frog — once an amiable stoner from a webcomic — was corrupted into a hate symbol, and the misogyny that fueled Gamergate showed up on the national political stage. (Meanwhile, left-leaning meme groups <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/16209-dat-boi-might-be-racist-and-it-s-ruining-a-facebook-group-for-dank-memes\">sparred internally</a> about whether or not the “dat boi” meme — an image of a frog riding a unicycle — had appropriated African American Vernacular English.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, it felt novel to point out how internet culture had begun informing our political reality. Within another decade, we had a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/the-people-in-elon-musk-doge-universe/\">pseudo-government-agency named after a meme</a>, which — to name just one of its many atrocities — cut international aid funding and led to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/usaid-shutdown-has-led-to-hundreds-of-thousands-of-deaths/\">the death of hundreds of thousands of people</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another ten years later, we’ve now had a full two decades to reckon with how the social internet has shaped us. But for people who were children in 2016, the year still holds a certain mystique. Google worked well. It was relatively easy to spot deepfakes. Teachers didn’t have to funnel all of their limited resources into determining if a student copy-pasted their homework from ChatGPT. Dating apps still held promise. There weren’t that many videos on Instagram. “Hamilton” was cool. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a rosy view of an online era that had its own mess of problems, yet it aligns with a larger movement toward a more analog lifestyle — it’s the same phenomenon that precipitated the resurgence of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/well/dating-irl-analog-online.html\">in-person matchmaking events</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/26/digital-camera-gen-z-vintage-photos/\">point-and-shoot digital cameras</a>. Social media has become so central to our lives that it’s not fun anymore, and people want to go back to a time before anyone had ever uttered the word “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling#:~:text=The%20term%20was%20first%20used,relation%20to%20the%20climate%20crisis.\">doomscrolling</a>.” Who could blame them?</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

She’s joining <a href=\"https://www.acrewcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Acrew Capital</a> as a general partner, working alongside founding partner Lauren Kolodny and the firm’s other partners, Rosenthal and Kolodny tell TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rosenthal left OpenAI about eight months ago after a three-year sprint at the AI lab that saw the launch of DALL·E, ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, Sora, and other products. “I wasn’t initially looking to join a VC fund,” she told TechCrunch. “I was out there meeting with lots of AI startups.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But after growing OpenAI’s enterprise sales team from two people to hundreds, she saw the appeal when Kolodny pitched her on venture capital. Instead of helping one startup with its go-to-market strategy, she could help a portfolio of them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In her time at OpenAI, “I learned a lot about behavior, both on the side of the buyers, how people are thinking about these purchases, and the gap between what most organizations think is possible and what they can actually deploy today,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, she has firsthand insight into what kind of moat an AI startup can build that won’t leave it vulnerable when model makers like OpenAI launch competing products.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Will OpenAI “just build everything and put every company out of business? You know, they are doing a lot already: they’re in consumer, they’re in enterprise, they’re building a device. I don’t think they are going to go after every potential enterprise application,” she says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So one moat is for enterprise AI startups to offer specialization. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-context-as-moat\">Context as moat</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, she thinks the key to a good startup moat will be “context” — or the information the AI stores in its context window memory as it works on requests.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Context is dynamic. It’s adaptable. It’s scalable. And I think what we’re seeing is going beyond sort of the basic RAG towards this idea of a context graph, which is persistent,” she says referring to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/04/why-rag-wont-solve-generative-ais-hallucination-problem/\">Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) the de facto method as of 2025 to minimize hallucinations by training LLMs on trusted, specific sources (and having the LLM cite them). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s still a lot of tech that needs to be developed for this area, though, from memory to reasoning beyond pattern recognition. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I expect real innovation here. I think this year we will see new approaches — the idea of context and memory,” Rosenthal says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But beyond startups working directly on context engineering, Rosenthal thinks enterprise apps that bake it in will have the advantage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ultimately, when we talk about moat, I think who owns and manages this context layer will become a large advantage for AI products,” she says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another opportunity she sees: startups not building atop a major lab’s state-of-the-art models, with their high prices.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think there is room in the market for cheaper models that are lighter weight and innovate on inference costs,” she says. These are models that are not, perhaps, at the top of the leaderboards of various benchmarks but “are still very useful” and more affordable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where I’m really excited to invest is on the application layer. I’m really interested in what will be the durable applications built on all of these different models, not just on the foundational models,” she says. She’s seeking startups with “interesting use cases” or that use AI to help enterprise employees work more efficiently.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for where she’s going to find these startups, she’ll be working her network among OpenAI’s alums for starters. Now that the AI outfit is 10 years old, the alums network has grown. Many have already founded startups that have raised big bucks at high valuations, ranging from OpenAI’s biggest competitor, Anthropic, to buzzy early-stage companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/ilya-sutskever-will-lead-safe-superintelligence-following-his-ceos-exit/\">Safe Superintelligence</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is also a growing precedent for high-level ex-OpenAI folks to become seed-stage investors. About a year ago, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s former head of consumer products, joined Felicis. He’s been crushing it ever since, and clearly having fun, getting in on big deals for hot startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/lmarena-lands-1-7b-valuation-four-months-after-launching-its-product/\">LMArena</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/top-openai-google-brain-researchers-set-off-a-300m-vc-frenzy-for-their-startup-periodic-labs/\">Periodic Labs</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I actually had a call with Peter a few months ago, and he helped me make the decision,” Rosenthal said of her choice to become an investor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Rosenthal may have a secret weapon to win deals.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube Shorts viewers might soon see AI versions of their favorite creators when scrolling through their feeds. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16440338?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Wednesday that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using their own likeness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This year you’ll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,” Mohan wrote in his annual letter. “Throughout this evolution, AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shorts, which Mohan said now averages 200 billion daily views, is one of YouTube’s most popular mediums. The company continues to invest in Shorts to sustain its viewership. While YouTube didn’t share additional details about these likenesses, the new capability will join the platform’s current AI tools for Shorts, including the ability to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/youtube-announces-new-generative-ai-tools-for-shorts-creators/\">generate AI clips</a>, AI stickers, AI auto-dubbing, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube will also equip creators with new tools to manage the use of their likeness in AI-generated content, according to Mohan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While YouTube will allow creators to feature their own likeness in their videos, the Google-owned platform recently launched technology to prevent others from using it. Last October, YouTube <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/youtubes-likeness-detection-technology-has-officially-launched/\">rolled out likeness-detection technology</a> to eligible creators to identify AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. Creators can then request the removal of AI-generated content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with other social platforms, YouTube has dealt with the spread of AI slop. Mohan says the company is working to maintain a high-quality viewing experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem,” Mohan <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/the-future-of-youtube-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>. “Today, once-odd trends like ASMR and watching other people play video games are mainstream hits. But with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">YouTube is also set to expand Shorts with new formats, including image posts, which are already popular on TikTok and Instagram Reels.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While the company is tight-lipped about the upcoming product, OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said in an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/19/openai-device-2026-lehane-jony-ive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Axios-hosted panel at Davos</a> the AI startup is on track to announce its first hardware device in the second half of this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last November, Sam Altman described the potential device to be more “peaceful and calm” than iPhones. Previous reporting suggests the company wants to build <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/05/openai-and-jony-ive-may-be-struggling-to-figure-out-their-ai-device/\">a screen-free and pocketable device</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company is not spilling any details, more recent reporting from <a href=\"https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/9278087?from=edn_maintab_index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Asian</a> <a href=\"https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3637768609533056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">publications</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/zhihuipikachu/status/2010745618734759946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2010745618734759946%7Ctwgr%5E240a0cfc941c1ac2ae5e63f720a5ba2c6ff677e1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.mashable.com%2Ftech%2F104907%2Fopenai-says-its-mystery-ai-wearable-is-on-track-for-2026-as-ai-earbuds-rumors-spread\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">leakers</a> suggests OpenAI’s first device could be a pair of earbuds. According to reports, this device is codenamed “Sweet Pea” and will have a unique design as compared to existing earbuds. The earbuds could work on a custom 2-nanometer processor and handle AI tasks locally instead of sending requests to the cloud.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/9278087?from=edn_maintab_index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">separate report</a> from a large Taiwanese newspaper noted that OpenAI was exploring a partnership with China-based Luxshare for manufacturing, but might eventually lean in favor of Taiwan’s Foxconn. The report also said in the first year of sales, OpenAI aims to ship 40 to 50 million units.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI’s ChatGPT has nearly a billion weekly users, but the company has to rely on other devices and platforms for distribution. With its own device, it might want to take more control of the development and distribution of the AI assistant and also release exclusive and purpose-built features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, replacing existing earbuds like AirPods in users’ daily lives is going to be challenging if there’s not a strong integration with operating systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Until now, there hasn’t been a standout AI device success story. Last year, Humane Pin got sold to HP. Rabbit is still just chugging along after the initial hype of 2024. And the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/friend-delays-shipments-of-its-ai-companion-pendant/\">Friend AI companion necklace</a> received a swift backlash for its marketing tactics. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, big tech companies are making moves into wearables.

Plus, you can easily apply your brand’s theme or edit individual slides using Express.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084393\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FY26Q1-Acrobat-L1Release-PRStatic1-Web-1920x1080-EN.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Adobe</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tools like Canva and NotebookLM already offer the ability to convert documents into presentations.

I would play my word. She would play hers. We would play back and forth over a few days, and the entire time, neither of us would have to see any overwhelming technicolor ads with deceptive skip buttons that blast us with even more pop-ups. It’s a simple life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You would think such an app already existed. You would be wrong. Until now. (Zynga, I will never forgive you for what you’ve done to Words with Friends).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At last, New York Times Games has brought my humble dreams to life with a Scrabble-like multiplayer app called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/nyt-crossplay-play-and-spell/id6615086509\">Crossplay</a>, available now on iOS and Android. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crossplay is not a Scrabble clone exactly, but unless you are the type of Scrabble lover that goes to tournaments or memorizes the Scrabble dictionary, it’s basically Scrabble. The game board and tile distribution are a bit different, and there’s a slight rule change around what happens once the bag runs out of tiles. Those differences may have been done for legal reasons. As a casual player, I barely noticed them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other social word games, Crossplay allows you to invite friends to play, or you can get matched with strangers near your skill level. For New York Times Games subscribers, the game will have no ads at all, but free users might see some banner ads. Still, it beats paying <em>$10 a month</em> to remove ads from Words With Friends, yet still have to deal with a cartoon-like interface among other features that annoy me.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083192\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=768,393 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=680,348 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1200,613 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1280,654 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=430,220 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=720,368 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=900,460 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=800,409 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1536,785 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=2048,1047 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=668,341 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=1207,617 1207w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=708,362 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5965.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Behold: one game that looks normal, and one that looks like Cocomelon for adults.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Crossplay (left), Words With Friends (right)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Scrabble purists may quibble about the slight rule changes, they may find delight in a feature of the game called CrossBot.

According to data from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351069/000119312524062156/d809296dpx14a6g.htm?utm_campaign=hollywood-s-cheap-ai-fix-won-t-work&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email\">ValueAct Capital</a>, a hedge fund that invests in the Times, users spent <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895\">more time in the Games app</a> than the actual News app by the end of 2023.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m not the only one who was craving a multi-player word game without egregious distractions — Jonathan Knight, Head of Games at the New York Times, thinks this is what makes its Games vertical so successful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Games like Spelling Bee and Wordle found a way to take the magical ‘solve a puzzle’ feeling and create a very mainstream, quick, snackable version of that that works well on your phone, that’s very sharable with friends and family, and that I think is very respectful of your time,” Knight told TechCrunch. “You can just decide to do it in the morning, or at night before you go to bed, and then go to bed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the New York Times, Wordle was played 4.2 billion times in 2025. Connections was played 1.6 billion times.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When TechCrunch spoke to Wordle creator Josh Wardle shortly before he sold his game, he shared a mindset similar to Knight’s. He told us, “people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sure, a publicly traded company like the New York Times isn’t as pure of heart as an indie developer making a game for his partner, but the spirit of the game has persisted. Even as Wordle’s viral moment passed, people kept up with their daily habit, according to Knight.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The share rate on Wordle — the percentage of users that share every day — has not changed since we acquired the game,” he said. “It’s a really cool way to bring people together. You know, we see the Pope talking about his Wordle, sharing with his brother.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, Knight’s team wants to extend the quiet simplicity of its games philosophy to Crossplay.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We wanted people to be able to just get in and play the game with friends and family, and then get on with your day,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s where Cam Badger got his start, at a pharmaceutical company. He expected to find structure and mentorship on the job but instead found “fragmented training, inconsistent coaching, and no real way to scale learning in a meaningful way,” he told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He spent four years as a sales rep, then a sales trainer, and then worked for a medical startup where he met Dr. Benny Alouf. The two lamented about how awful many sales reps were at life science companies like pharma businesses, medical device startups, and so forth. The duo, alongside Bhrugu Giri, decided to try and fix this, launching PraxisPro, a sales coaching platform specifically targeted at medical fields.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He believes that better salespeople will help get more treatments into doctor’s hands, which will ultimately help their patients.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When commercial interactions with healthcare providers are ineffective, patients don’t get a fair shot at therapies that could meaningfully change their lives,” Badger, the company’s CEO, said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PraxisPro launched in 2023, though its first product was not released until 2025. The company announced on Wednesday a $6 million seed round led by AlleyCorp. Others in the round include FlyBridge, South Loop Ventures, and Zeal Capital Partners. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">PraxisPro is a standalone platform that can also be integrated into enterprise software. It develops small language models trained on life science data to help each company navigate the nuances and context needed to interact with healthcare providers. From there, the company has created an AI agent that helps the commercial sales team practice their communication skills before engaging with customers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Badger said communication is critical in medical sales. So many teams are worried about staying compliant, as each company is responsible for ensuring sales messaging complies with legal frameworks. Aside from helping train sales reps to stay compliant, PraxisPro also hopes to help better execute them to communicate patient needs with healthcare providers. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, a salesperson may have 15 interactions with a health care provider as part of the sales process. PraxisPro has a conversational AI feature that lets sales reps practice and plan these interactions and be better prepared for what the discussion usually entails, including any pushback that might come up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are other AI role-playing tools (like Quantified and SmartWinnr), but Badger says his is different because his company is trained on smaller data sets and specifically focuses on the life sciences sector. The fresh capital will be used toward research and development, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, this was the tool he wished he had when he was still working as a sales rep all those years ago. He struggled, he said, and almost lost his job, but managed to work his way up to become one of the company’s top performers. Now, he wants to give others a hand. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If we can give commercial teams the ability to prepare, practice, and engage at a higher level, consistently and responsibly, then we’re not just improving commercial operations, but we’re helping ensure that innovative therapies reach the patients who need them most,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to clarify the name of the co-founder. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Lemonade said it would train its own usage-based risk prediction models to determine when a driver is using Full Self-Driving or operating the vehicle themselves, and price accordingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lemonade is calling the new product “Autonomous Car insurance.” Tesla’s software does not currently make cars completely autonomous, and drivers need to be ready to take over at any moment. But the product is clearly a bet that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will ultimately fulfill his long-delayed promise that his company will make that happen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Traditional insurers treat a Tesla like any other car, and AI like any other driver. But a driver who can see 360 degrees, never gets drowsy, and reacts in milliseconds isn’t like any other driver,” Shai Wininger, co-founder and president of Lemonade, said in a statement. “Our existing pay-per-mile product has given us something no traditional insurer has: a unique tech stack designed to collect massive amounts of real driving data for precise, dynamic pricing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new car insurance product will launch in Arizona on January 26, and in Oregon the following month. Lemonade claims that “the safer FSD software becomes, the more our prices will drop.” The company’s existing auto insurance offering is available for “most popular cars” in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has offered its own car insurance to customers for years now, though in late 2025 the company was hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI). The automaker was accused, along with partner State National Insurance Company, of “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims,” “unreasonable denials,” and engaging in “unfair claims settlement practices.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla has denied the allegations.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In 2009, they quit to focus on the business full-time, and rebranded it as Zomato in 2010 amid a naming conflict with eBay, before expanding into food delivery in 2015. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chaddah left the company in 2018, and Zomato later consolidated its position by acquiring <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber Eats’ India business</a> in 2020, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/zomato-blinkit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blinkit</a> (formerly Grofers) for $568 million in 2022.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The leadership change comes as Eternal <a href=\"https://b.zmtcdn.com/investor-relations/Eternal_Shareholders_Letter_Q3FY26_Results.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> (PDF) strong momentum in its third quarter, with profit rising about 73% to ₹1.02 billion (around $11.13 million) from a year earlier, on adjusted revenue ₹166.92 billion (about $1.8 billion), up 190% from a year ago. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Blinkit remained the company’s fastest-growing business, with net order value jumping 121% to ₹133.0 billion (roughly $1.45 billion) in the last quarter.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside Eternal, Goyal has been working on other projects for the last few months, including a longevity-focused initiative called Continue Research, and an experimental brain-health wearable dubbed “Temple”. He is a co-founder of the aviation startup LAT Aerospace, and also is an angel investor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The handover could be an indicator of Blinkit’s rising influence inside Eternal, as the company’s growth skews toward quick commerce and away from its mainstay, food delivery. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quick commerce in India is booming even as the sector faces rising scrutiny over working conditions for the thousands of gig workers employed in the industry. The country’s labour ministry recently asked platforms to drop their <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/india-reportedly-tells-quick-commerce-firms-to-drop-10-minute-delivery-promise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“10-minute delivery” marketing</a>, and put in place measures to improve conditions for their delivery personnel.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/03/advanced-geothermal-startups-are-just-getting-warmed-up/\">like Fervo and Sage Geosystems</a> have been pursuing that angle, and experts agree it has tremendous potential. By contrast, conventional geothermal, which taps naturally fractured hotspots, has been stagnant, generating just <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/2025-us-geothermal-market-report\">4 gigawatts</a> in the United States, up only <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=17871\">about a gigawatt</a> in the last decade or so.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Conventional geothermal has been held back by outdated assumptions, Hoiland told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They underestimated how many undiscovered systems there are, maybe by an order of magnitude or more,” Hoiland said. With modern drilling techniques, “you can get a lot more out of each of them, maybe even an order of magnitude or more from each of those. All of a sudden the number goes from tens of gigawatts to what could be a terawatt-scale opportunity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zanskar is relying on AI to help break conventional geothermal out of its malaise. In the process, the startup has resuscitated a flagging power plant in New Mexico and discovered two new sites with over 100 megawatts of combined potential.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those successes have helped Zanskar land a $115 million Series C led by Spring Lane Capital with participation from the All Aboard Fund, Carica Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Imperative Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Munich Re Ventures, Obvious Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, StepStone Group, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Tranquillion, Union Square Ventures, University Growth Fund, and UP.Partners.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many potential geothermal sites have been overlooked because people have been looking for evidence on the surface like a hot spring or a volcano, Hoiland said. But about 95% of all geothermal systems lack such a tell, he added. “We just keep finding them by accident. That is a great application for AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To find new geothermal resources, Zanskar first feeds supervised machine learning models a range of data, including past accidental discoveries. When they have identified a promising site, the company sends a team to the site validate the discovery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zanskar then has to come up with a plan to develop it. For that, the team uses another AI approach, one developed for this very purpose called Bayesian evidential learning (BEL). In BEL, existing data helps build a series of assumptions known as priors, and then models work to falsify those hypotheses, spitting out probabilities for each. Where there are gaps, the startup has built a geothermal simulator to fill in the blanks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So far, Zanskar’s approach has been working. The previous funding round allowed the startup to explore three sites, each of which it considered a success. “Three of three,” said Zanskar co-founder and CTO Joel Edwards. “What does it look like when you try 10?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has enough sites in the pipeline to support at least a gigawatt of generating capacity, Hoiland said. For now, they’ve been focused on the U.S. West, which has the most potential. He would like to find at least 10 confirmed sites to help Zanskar court project finance investors, which provide access to lower cost capital than VCs. If the company can make that work, then it might get through the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/27/climate-startup-valley-of-death/\">valley of death</a> that has claimed many other climate tech startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hoiland is not convinced that Zanskar has solved all the challenges associated with finding geothermal resources, but he’s optimistic the company is on the right path.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We now know this is the future of exploration,” he said. “This is going to change geothermal in very short order.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Not coincidentally, it has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/preply-the-language-app-known-for-its-live-tutors-closes-out-series-c-at-120m-and-doubles-down-on-ai/\">ramped up AI integration</a> to support its 100,000 tutors and continue scaling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s a fine line — Duolingo <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/duolingo-launches-148-courses-created-with-ai-after-sharing-plans-to-replace-contractors-with-ai/\">faced backlash</a> after declaring it would become <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/17/duolingo-ceo-says-controversial-ai-memo-was-misunderstood/\">an “AI-first company,”</a> and tutors have been a key differentiator for Preply. The company is adamant it won’t replace them — but AI can also bring consistency to a model that relies on self-employed instructors. The future of learning “is going to be human-guided and amplified by AI,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Bigai, Preply already applies AI to features such as lesson summaries and homework, but also to match learners to tutors that best fit their needs. To further develop these capabilities, he said Preply is now hiring AI talent across its four offices — Barcelona, London and New York but also Kyiv, which the company hasn’t left despite the Russian invasion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Preply is headquartered in the U.S., where it got its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lift99.co/blog/founder-stories-kirill-bigai-preply\">first start</a>, Bigai and his cofounders are Ukrainian and the company has been very actively <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://preply.com/en/stand-with-ukraine\">supporting their home country</a>. They have been doing that in several ways since the war started, including as an employer. “We are very committed [to the] Ukrainian office,” said Bigai.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Out of Preply’s 750 employees, approximately 150 people work from Kyiv, despite Russian strikes regularly forcing them into shelters and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/17/europe/russia-bombing-ukrainians-freezing-defiant-intl-cmd\">causing power outages</a> that have made the current freezing winter particularly challenging. “Our office has different generators so we have electricity, Internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Bigai said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These employees may be grateful to Preply — but Bigai is grateful to them and has deep admiration for his people. “Ukrainians are going through very challenging times, and it builds a significant resilience and creativity,” he said. Having to adapt to the reality and uncertainty of war also transformed Preply. “I think the fact that the company went through this experience — and how so many people helped other people — made us stronger, more resilient, more creative,” he added. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its new funding, the edtech company has now joined the growing cohort of unicorns with Ukrainian roots, including <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://siliconcanals.com/ukraines-fintech-it-group-becomes-unicorn/\">Fintech-IT Group</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://tech.eu/2025/05/29/ukrainian-unicorn-grammarly-raises-1-billion-from-general-captial/\">Grammarly</a>. But it may also follow in the footsteps of Airbnb, whose former CFO Laurence Tosi led the Series D through his growth equity firm, WestCap.

ChatGPT alone generated $3.4 billion in global in-app purchase (IAP) revenue — a figure that we reported on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/chatgpts-mobile-app-hits-new-milestone-of-3b-in-consumer-spending/#:~:text=Worldwide%2C%20consumers%20spent%20an%20estimated,to%20reach%20the%202024%20figure.\">late last year</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084015\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg 1554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=300,256 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=768,656 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=680,581 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=1200,1025 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=1280,1094 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=430,367 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=720,615 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=900,769 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=800,684 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1313 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=668,571 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=439,375 439w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=722,617 722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=621,531 621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.10-PM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sensor Tower</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2025, consumers spent 48 billion hours in generative AI apps, or 3.6x the total time spent in 2024 and 10x the level seen in 2023.

Over the past year, they’ve been rolling out new capabilities at a rapid pace, improving in areas like coding assistance, content generation, reasoning, task execution, accuracy, and more. The report specifically called out improvements in image and video generation, like ChatGPT’s GPT-4o image generation model released in March, and Google’s Nano Banana.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Among the top AI publishers, OpenAI and DeepSeek accounted for nearly 50% of global downloads, up from 21% in 2024. Meanwhile, big tech publishers grew their share of the market from 14% to nearly 30% during this same time, crowding out earlier ChatGPT competitors like Nova, Codeway, and Chat Smith. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3084014\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg 1652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=1200,539 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=1280,575 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=430,193 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=720,323 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=900,404 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=800,359 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=1536,690 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=668,300 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=1374,617 1374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=708,318 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.37.39-PM.jpg?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sensor Tower</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The report also highlighted the role that mobile plays in connecting users to generative AI services. Sensor Tower estimates that the total audience for AI assistants topped 200 million in the U.S. by year-end, and more than half (110M) were accessing the assistants exclusively on mobile devices. In 2024, for comparison, only around 13 million users were mobile-only.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond assistants, other popular AI apps included the AI music generation app Suno; ByteDance’s text-to-video app, Jimeng AI; and AI companion apps like Character.ai and PolyBuzz.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Mobile apps topped games in consumer spending in 2025, driven by AI revenue. \" class=\"wp-image-3084019\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg 1550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,259 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,664 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,588 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=1200,1037 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=1280,1107 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=430,372 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=720,622 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=900,778 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=800,692 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1328 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=668,577 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=434,375 434w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=714,617 714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=614,531 614w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sensor-Tower-State-of-Mobile-2026-2.31.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sensor Tower</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, AI wasn’t the only revenue driver last year, Sensor Tower found.

The lawsuit against Snap was brought by a 19-year-old known in court documents as K.G.M., accusing the social media app of designing algorithms and features that caused addiction and mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit also names other platforms, including Meta, YouTube, and TikTok. No settlement has been reached with these platforms. Notably, Snap is still a defendant in other similar social media addiction cases filed against it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2025-12-03/snapchat-ignored-staff-warnings-about-teens-mental-health\">documents unveiled in the ongoing cases</a>, Snap employees raised concerns around risks to the mental health of teens dating back at least nine years. The company has said these examples were “cherry-picked” and were taken out of context.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plaintiffs in these cases are drawing parallels to Big Tobacco — referring to lawsuits in the 1990s against cigarette companies that concealed health risks — alleging that the platforms obscured information about potential harms from their users. They argue that features like infinite scroll, auto video play and algorithmic recommendations have tricked users into continuously using apps, leading to depression, eating disorders, and self-harm, according to NYT.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snap CEO Evan Spiegel had been scheduled to testify in the trial, which would have marked the first time a social media company faces a jury in an addiction lawsuit — no platform has lost such a case at trial yet. The remaining case against Meta, TikTok, and YouTube is set to proceed with jury selection beginning next Monday, January 27, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expected to take the witness stand. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If plaintiffs prevail, legal experts predict the cases could result in multibillion-dollar settlements and potentially force platforms to redesign their products.

The deal was smaller than Amagi’s earlier plan, after the company trimmed the fresh issue and reduced the number of shares to be sold by existing backers from 34.2 million.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Norwest Venture Partners, Accel, and Premji Invest were among Amagi’s existing shareholders who sold shares in the IPO. Subramanian told TechCrunch the sales were only a “very small portion” of holdings, and said the company’s founders were not selling a single share.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For us as an event, it’s a pit stop in a long journey,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Accel has particularly retained close to a 10% stake in Amagi after the IPO, even as the listing locks in a roughly 3.3x gain on shares it acquired at around ₹108 per share. “To make the IPO, we are reluctantly exiting as little as possible to make this happen,” said Shekhar Kirani, an Accel partner.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2008 by Subramanian, Srividhya Srinivasan, and Arunachalam Srinivasan Karapattu, Amagi counts content companies such as Lionsgate Studios, Fox, and Sinclair Broadcast Group among its clients, as well as distributors including Roku, Vizio, Rakuten TV, and DirecTV, and advertising platforms such as The Trade Desk and Index Exchange.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Subramanian said Amagi is riding a shift as broadcasters and streamers move away from “big iron” hardware and satellite-based workflows toward cloud-based operations, arguing that only a small portion of the industry has completed the transition so far. The company has also begun pitching new automation and AI-driven tools to help media companies cut labor-heavy operating costs, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s revenue from operations rose 34.6% year-over-year to ₹7.05 billion (around $77.18 million) in the six months ended September 30, 2025, while net revenue retention was about 127% — meaning existing customers increased their spending by 27%, per its <a href=\"https://www.amagi.com/hubfs/Project%20Chrysalis%20-%20RHP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prospectus</a> (PDF).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi is betting that broadcast and live video are still in the early stages of moving to the cloud, Subramanian told TechCrunch, estimating that less than 10% of the industry has made the shift, leaving a long runway as media groups modernise infrastructure and expand ad-supported streaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s appeal lies in being a “premium” and highly reliable platform for blue-chip customers, said Rachit Parekh, a partner at Accel, arguing that downtime during major live events can be highly costly for broadcasters and streamers. This dynamic has helped drive high customer retention and expansion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonetheless, Amagi is also competing against legacy broadcast vendors that are racing to modernize their own offerings for the cloud, while its push into AI-driven automation will test whether Amagi can expand beyond infrastructure into software with better profit margins without rising cloud costs eating into profitability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi said it plans to plow most of the fresh proceeds into technology and cloud infrastructure, allocating ₹5.50 billion ($60.21 million) for that purpose, while also setting aside funds for potential acquisitions and general corporate use, per its prospectus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amagi’s debut comes as India’s IPO market has drawn a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/softbank-stays-in-as-meesho-606m-ipo-becomes-indias-first-major-e-commerce-listing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rising number of technology-led listings</a>, supported by strong domestic investor demand even as late-stage startup funding remains subdued. The shift has positioned public markets as both a growth-financing option and a path to exits for early backers, a dynamic that has become more visible as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/27/india-startup-funding-hits-11b-in-2025-as-investors-grow-more-selective/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">private capital has turned more selective</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s tech sector <a href=\"https://w.tracxn.com/report-releases/india-tech-annual-funding-report-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recorded 42 IPOs in 2025</a>, up from 36 in 2024, per market intelligence firm Tracxn. Several venture-backed startups, including consumer and fintech firms, are also widely expected to test public markets in 2026 as the pipeline builds.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Voice is a popular medium for communication among people and businesses in India. That’s why enterprises and startups are eager to use voice AI to be more efficient at customer support, sales, customer acquisition, hiring, and training.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But recognizing market demand is one thing — proving businesses will pay is another. Y Combinator rejected the application from <a href=\"https://www.bolna.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bolna</a>, a voice orchestration startup built by Maitreya Wagh and Prateek Sachan, five times before finally accepting it into the fall 2025 batch, skeptical that the founders could turn interest into revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we were applying for Y Combinator, the feedback we got was, ‘great to see that you have a product that can create realistic voice agents, but Indian enterprises are not going to pay, and you are not going to make money out of this,’” Wagh told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup applied with the same idea for the fall batch but was able to show it had revenue of more than $25,000 coming in every month for the last few months. At that time, the company was running $100 pilots to help users build voice agents. Now the startup is pricing those pilots at $500.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The momentum has continued. The startup said on Tuesday that it has raised a $6.3 million seed round led by General Catalyst, with participation from Y Combinator, Blume Ventures, Orange Collective, Pioneer Fund, Transpose Capital, and Eight Capital. The round also includes individual investors, including Aarthi Ramamurthy, Arpan Sheth, Sriwatsan Krishnan, Ravi Iyer, and Taro Fukuyama.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-product-and-customers\">The product and customers</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bolna is building an orchestration layer — essentially a platform that connects and manages different AI voice technologies — akin to startups like Vapi, LiveKit, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/voicerun-nabs-5-5m-to-build-voice-agent-factory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VoiceRun</a>, to suit the idiosyncrasies of interactions in India, including noise cancellation, getting verification on the caller ID platform Truecaller, and handling mixed languages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Feature-wise, the company has built specific nuances for Indian users, such as speaking numbers in English regardless of the core language, or allowing for keypad input for longer inputs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083843\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg 2940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1200,682 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1280,728 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=430,245 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=720,409 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=900,512 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=800,455 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=668,380 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=659,375 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=1085,617 1085w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=708,403 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bolna-UI.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bolna</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wagh noted that the key differentiation of Bolna is that it makes it easy for users to build voice agents by just describing them, even if they don’t know much about the underlying technology, and start using them for calls. The company said that 75% of its revenue is coming from self-serve customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also said that because Bolna is an orchestration layer, it doesn’t depend on a single model, so enterprises can easily switch when there is a better model available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our platform allows customers to switch models easily or even use different models for different locales to get the best out of them. An orchestration layer is necessary for enterprises to ensure they are getting the best models because one model can be better today and another one can be better tomorrow,” Wagh said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has a range of clients, including car reselling platform Spinny, on-demand house-help startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/indias-snabbit-valuation-doubled-to-180m-in-5-months-on-its-quick-house-help-bet/\">Snabbit</a>, beverage companies, and dating apps. Most of these are small to midsize businesses that use Bolna’s self-serve platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Separately, Bolna is pursuing large enterprise deals. For these large enterprises and custom implementations, Bolna has a team of forward-deployed engineers — specialists who work directly with clients on-site or closely with their teams. The startup has signed two large enterprises as paying customers and has four more in the pilot stage. Currently, Bolna employs nine forward-deployed engineers and is adding two to three people to that team every month to support this enterprise push.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bolna has seen steady growth in both call volumes and revenue. It say it’s now handling over 200,000 calls per day and on the verge of crossing $700,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company noted that while 60% to 70% of call volume is in English or Hindi, other regional languages are steadily rising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Akarsh Shrivastava, who is part of the investment team at General Catalyst, said that the firm found Bolna impressive because its orchestration layer is flexible for various kinds of customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Bolna allows you the freedom to choose any model and has a stack behind it to mold it according to your requirement. It’s a good option for people who want to own some part of the stack, want flexibility in model picking, and want to be able to maintain those products themselves,” Shrivastava told TechCrunch over a call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Maybe they aren’t these chipmakers’ shiniest, most advanced chips, but they’re high-performance processors used for AI, making the export controversial. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2026-01-20/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-on-the-future-of-ai-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unloaded</a> on both the administration and the chip companies over the decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The criticism was particularly notable because one of those chipmakers, Nvidia, is a major partner and investor in Anthropic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The CEOs of these companies say, ‘It’s the embargo on chips that’s holding us back,’” Amodei  said, incredulous, in response to a question about the new rules. The decision is going to come back to bite the U.S., he warned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are many years ahead of China in terms of our ability to make chips,” he told Bloomberg’s editor-in-chief, who was interviewing him. “So I think it would be a big mistake to ship these chips.” Amodei then painted an alarming picture of what’s at stake. He talked about the “incredible national security implications” of AI models that represent “essentially cognition, that are essentially intelligence.” He likened future AI to a “country of geniuses in a data center,” saying to imagine “100 million people smarter than any Nobel Prize winner,” all under the control of one country or another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The image underscored why he thinks chip exports matter so much. But then came the biggest blow. “I think this is crazy,” Amodei said of the administration’s latest move. “It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sound you hear? The team at Nvidia, screaming into their phones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia isn’t just another chip company. While Anthropic runs on the servers of Microsoft and Amazon and Google, Nvidia alone supplies the GPUs that power Anthropic’s AI models (every cloud provider needs Nvidia’s GPUs). Not only does Nvidia sit at the center of everything, but it also recently announced it was investing in Anthropic to the tune of up to $10 billion.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just two months ago, the companies <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-nvidia-anthropic-announce-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced that financial relationship</a>, along with a “deep technology partnership” with cheery promises to optimize each other’s technology. Fast-forward to Davos, and Amodei is comparing his partner to an arms dealer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Maybe it was just an unguarded moment — it’s possible he got swept up in his own rhetoric and blurted out the analogy. But given Anthropic’s strong position in the AI market, it seems more likely he felt comfortable speaking with confidence. The company has raised billions, is valued in the hundreds of billions, and its Claude coding assistant has developed a reputation as a highly beloved and top-tier AI coding tool, particularly among developers working on complex, real-world projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s also entirely possible that Anthropic genuinely fears Chinese AI labs and wants Washington to act. If you want to get someone’s attention, nuclear proliferation comparisons are probably a pretty effective way to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But what’s perhaps most remarkable is that Amodei could sit onstage at Davos, drop a bomb like that, and walk away to some other gathering without fear that he just adversely impacted his business. News cycles move on, sure. Anthropic is also on solid footing right now. But it does feel that the AI race has grown so existential in the minds of its leaders that the usual constraints — investor relations, strategic partnerships, diplomatic niceties — don’t apply anymore. Amodei isn’t concerned about what he can and can’t say. More than anything else he said on that stage, that fearlessness is worth paying attention to.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
