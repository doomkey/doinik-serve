The number of startup funding rounds fell by nearly 39% from a year earlier, to 1,518 deals, according to Tracxn. Total funding slipped more modestly — down just over 17% to $10.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That pullback was not uniform. Seed-stage funding fell sharply to $1.1 billion in 2025, down 30% from 2024, as investors cut back on more experimental bets. Late-stage funding also cooled, slipping to $5.5 billion, a 26% decline from last year, amid tougher scrutiny of scale, profitability, and exit prospects. However, early-stage funding proved more resilient, rising to $3.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079057\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,1000 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,1067 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,358 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,600 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,750 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,667 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1536,1280 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,557 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=450,375 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=740,617 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=637,531 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/stage-wise-funding-india-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The capital deployment focus has increased towards early-stage startups,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn, pointing to growing confidence in founders who can demonstrate stronger product–market fit, revenue visibility and unit economics in a tighter funding environment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-ai-quest\">The AI quest</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nowhere was that recalibration clearer than in AI, as AI startups in India raised just over $643 million across 100 deals in 2025, a modest 4.1% increase from a year earlier, per Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. The capital was mainly spread across early and early-growth stages. Early-stage AI funding totaled $273.3 million, while late-stage rounds raised $260 million, reflecting investor preference for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">application-led businesses</a> over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">capital-intensive model development</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was in sharp contrast to the U.S., where AI funding in 2025 surged past $121 billion across 765 rounds, per Tracxn, a 141% jump from 2024, and was overwhelmingly dominated by late-stage deals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We don’t yet have an AI-first company in India, which is $40–$50 million of revenue, if not $100 million, in a year’s time frame, and that is globally happening,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India, Swaroop told TechCrunch, lacks large foundational model companies and will take time to build the research depth, talent pipeline, and patient capital needed to compete at that layer — making application-led AI and adjacent deep-tech areas a more realistic focus in the near term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This pragmatism has shaped where investors are placing longer-term bets outside core AI. Venture capital is increasingly flowing into manufacturing and deep-tech sectors. These are some of the areas where India faces less global capital competition and has clear advantages in talent, cost structures, and customer access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While AI now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/here-are-the-49-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">absorbs a significant share of investor attention</a>, capital in India arguably remains more evenly distributed than in the U.S., with substantial funding still flowing into consumer, manufacturing, fintech, and deep-tech startups. Swaroop noted that advanced manufacturing in particular has emerged as a long-term opportunity, with the number of such startups increasing nearly tenfold over the past four to five years — an area he described as a clear “right to win” for India given lower global capital competition.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, said AI startups accounted for roughly 30–40% of deals in India in 2025, but pointed to a parallel surge in consumer-facing companies as changing behaviour among India’s urban population creates demand for faster, more on-demand services — from quick commerce to household services — categories that play to India’s scale and density rather than Silicon Valley–style capital intensity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-india-versus-the-u-s\">India versus the U.S.</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Data from PitchBook shows a stark divergence in capital deployment between India and the U.S. in 2025. U.S. venture funding surged to $89.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone, according to PitchBook data up to December 23, compared with about $4.2 billion raised by Indian startups over the same period.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079058\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=768,581 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=680,515 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1200,908 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1280,969 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=430,325 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=720,545 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=900,681 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=800,605 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=1536,1162 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=668,506 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=496,375 496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=815,617 815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=702,531 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/indian-startup-funding-count-deal-size-2025.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, that gap does not tell the whole story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightspeed’s Taneja cautioned against drawing direct parallels between India and the U.S., arguing that differences in population density, labour costs, and consumer behaviour shape which business models can scale. Categories such as quick commerce and on-demand services have found far greater traction in India than in the U.S., reflecting local economics rather than any lack of ambition among founders or investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Recently, Lightspeed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lightspeed-raises-record-9b-in-fresh-capital/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised $9 billion in fresh capital</a> with a strong focus on AI, but Taneja said the move does not signal a wholesale shift in the firm’s India strategy. The U.S. fund, he noted, is geared toward a different market and maturity cycle, while Lightspeed’s India arm will continue backing consumer startups alongside selectively exploring AI opportunities shaped by local demand rather than global capital intensity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nuances-in-india-s-startup-ecosystem\">Nuances in India’s startup ecosystem</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s startup ecosystem also saw funding for women-led startups tighten. Capital invested in women-founded tech startups held relatively steady at about $1 billion in 2025, down 3% from a year earlier, according to Tracxn’s report. Still, that headline figure masked a sharper pullback beneath the surface. The number of funding rounds in women-founded startups fell by 40%, while their first-time funded counterparts declined by 36%.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079059\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg 1510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,89 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,227 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,201 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,354 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,378 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,127 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,213 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,266 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,236 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,197 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1440,425 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=708,209 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/women-indian-startups-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,15 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1510px) 100vw, 1510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">India’s women-led startups saw a 3% dip in funding in 2025</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, investor participation narrowed sharply as selectivity increased, with about 3,170 investors taking part in funding rounds in India this year, a 53% drop from roughly 6,800 a year earlier, according to Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. India-based investors accounted for nearly half of that activity, with around 1,500 domestic funds and angels participating — a sign that local capital played a more prominent role as global investors turned cautious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activity also became more concentrated among a smaller group of repeat backers. Inflection Point Ventures emerged as the most active investor, participating in 36 funding rounds, followed by Accel with 34, Tracxn data shows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian government’s participation in the startup ecosystem became more visible in 2025. New Delhi announced a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/india-pledges-fresh-billion-for-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.15 billion Fund of Funds</a> in January to expand capital access for startups, followed by a ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation scheme aimed at areas such as energy transition, quantum computing, robotics, space technology, biotech, and AI, using a mix of long-term loans, equity infusions and allocations to deep-tech funds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That push has begun to catalyze private capital as well. The government’s growing involvement helped spur a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/nvidia-qualcomm-join-u-s-indian-vcs-to-help-build-indias-next-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nearly $2 billion commitment</a> from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/u-s-and-indian-vcs-just-formed-a-1b-alliance-to-fund-indias-deep-tech-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. and Indian venture capital and private equity firms</a>, including Accel, Blume Ventures, and Celesta Capital, to back deep-tech startups — an effort that also brought Nvidia on board as an adviser and drew Qualcomm Ventures. Furthermore, the Indian government also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/india-eyes-global-quantum-computer-push-and-qpiai-is-its-chosen-vehicle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-led a $32 million funding</a> for quantum computing startup QpiAI earlier this year — a rare federal move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This growing state involvement has helped ease a risk long flagged by investors: regulatory uncertainty. “One of the biggest risks you don’t want to underwrite is what happens if regulation changes,” said Taneja of Lightspeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As government entities become more familiar with the startup ecosystem, Taneja added, policy is more likely to evolve alongside it — reducing uncertainty for investors backing companies with longer development cycles.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-exits-in-india\">Exits in India</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reduced uncertainty has already started to show up in exit markets to some extent. India saw a steady pipeline of technology IPOs over the past two years, with 42 tech companies going public in 2025, up 17% from 36 in 2024, per Tracxn. Much of the demand for those listings has come from domestic institutional and retail investors, easing long-standing concerns that Indian startup exits depend too heavily on foreign capital. M&amp;A activity also picked up, with acquisitions rising 7% year-over-year to 136 deals, Tracxn data shows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swaroop of Accel said investors had long worried that India’s public markets were mainly sustained by foreign capital, raising questions about exit durability during global downturns. “This year has disproven that,” he said, pointing to the growing role of domestic investors in absorbing technology listings — a shift that has made exits more predictable and reduced reliance on volatile overseas flows.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079060\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=768,600 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=680,531 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1200,938 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1280,1000 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=430,336 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=720,563 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=900,703 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=800,625 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=1536,1200 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=668,522 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=480,375 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=790,617 790w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/india-ipo-growth-2025-tracxn.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tracxn</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India’s unicorn pipeline in 2025 also reflected that shift toward restraint. While the number of new unicorns remained flat year over year, Indian startups reached $1 billion valuations with less capital, fewer funding rounds, and a smaller pool of institutional investors, pointing to a more measured path to scale compared with both previous years and global peers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Challenges remain as India heads into 2026, particularly around how it positions itself in the global race for AI and whether late-stage funding can deepen without relying on outsized capital inflows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even so, the shifts seen in 2025 point to a startup ecosystem that is maturing rather than retreating — one where capital is being deployed more deliberately, exits are becoming more predictable, and domestic market dynamics increasingly shape its growth. For investors, India is emerging less as a substitute for developed markets and more as a complementary arena with its own risk profile, timelines, and opportunities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

At TechCrunch Disrupt, three investors — Thomas Green of Insight Partners, Moxxie Ventures’ Katie Stanton, and GV’s Sangeen Zeb — broke down what they’ll be looking for in the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers tell a clear story. Fewer rounds are getting funded but deal sizes have grown, said Green citing a study.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It has never been easier to start a company, and it has never been harder to build something that is defensible,” Stanton said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Zeb, GV uses a specific formula to evaluate companies. The firm analyzes whether startups have achieved product-market fit, examining demand patterns to ensure every quarter outperforms the last. “That sequence should be happening consistently,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanton echoed this priority. “Can you prove that you can repeatedly sell? Can you prove that you can repeatedly grow in a big and growing market?”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Green cautioned that not every company should pursue venture-scale growth. “It’s not worth even taking this money unless you think it can be a really big business, right?” he said. “Most companies should not [pursue] venture scale. They should not take hundreds of millions of dollars.”  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond metrics, all three investors emphasized founder quality. Stanton said she is looking for passionate founders who can endure the long journey of building a company. Zeb agreed. “Passion is still the most important thing,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The panel inevitably turned to AI. Green assured non-AI companies: “Just because you’re not AI doesn’t mean you don’t have a very attractive asset, intrinsic quality to you,” he said.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For AI companies trying to differentiate in a crowded market, Green returns to first principles. “We try to understand, if it’s a market with a lot of competition — [including] both incumbents and next-gen competitors and platform players — what is going to be the standout path?”  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stanton said she looks founders who combine industry and technical expertise, while Zeb prioritizes relentless drive, seeking founders who are constantly asking how to move faster than the competition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite market fluctuations, the panel suggested that core investor priorities remain consistent. “The bar is high, but if the outcome can be impossibly huge, we’ll take that [bet],” Green said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They work for the New York-headquartered nonprofit Access Now, specifically its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://accessnow.org/help/\">Digital Security Helpline</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their mission is to be the team of people who journalists, human rights defenders, and dissidents can go to if they suspect they’ve been hacked, such as with mercenary spyware made by companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/\">NSO Group</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/sanctioned-spyware-maker-intellexa-had-direct-access-to-government-espionage-victims-researchers-say/\">Intellexa</a>, or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/paragon/\">Paragon</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The idea is to provide this 24/7 service to civil society and journalists so they can reach out whenever they have… a cybersecurity incident,” Hassen Selmi, who leads the incident response team at the Helpline, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obk5T6kS0WY&amp;t=292s\">According to Bill Marczak</a>, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab who has been investigating spyware for almost 15 years, Access Now’s Helpline is a “frontline resource” for journalists and others who may have been targeted or hacked with spyware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The helpline has become a critical funnel for victims. So much so that when Apple sends its users a so-called “threat notification” alerting them that they have been targeted with mercenary spyware, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/why-apple-sends-spyware-victims-to-this-nonprofit-security-lab/\">the tech giant has long directed victims to Access Now’s investigators</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In speaking with TechCrunch, Selmi described a scenario where <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/apple-alerts-exploit-developer-that-his-iphone-was-targeted-with-government-spyware/\">someone gets one of these threat notifications</a>, and where Access Now can help victims.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Having someone who could explain it to them, tell them what they should do, what they should not do, what this means… This is a big relief for them,” said Selmi. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to several digital rights experts who have investigated spyware cases and previously spoke with TechCrunch, Apple is generally taking the right approach, even if the optics look like a trillion-dollar tech giant offloading its responsibility to a small team of nonprofit workers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being mentioned by Apple in the notifications, said Selmi, was “one of the biggest milestones” for the helpline.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi and his colleagues now look into about 1,000 cases of suspected government spyware attacks per year. Around half of those cases turn into actual investigations, and only around 5% of them, around 25, result in a confirmed case of spyware infection, according to Mohammed Al-Maskati, the helpline’s director.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Selmi started doing this work in 2014, Access Now were only investigating around 20 cases of suspected spyware attacks per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, there were three or four people working in each timezone in Costa Rica, Manila, and Tunisia, locations that allowed them to have someone online throughout the whole day. The team isn’t that much bigger now, with fewer than 15 people working for the helpline. The helpline has more people in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan region, given that these are hotspots for spyware cases, according to Selmi.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The increase in cases, Selmi explained, is due to several circumstances. For one, the helpline is now more well known, so it attracts more people. Then, with government spyware going global and becoming more available, there are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/why-a-lot-of-people-are-getting-hacked-with-government-spyware/\">potentially more cases of abuse</a>. Finally, the helpline team has done more outreach to potentially targeted populations, finding cases of abuse they may not have found otherwise. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tHave you received a notification from Apple, Google, or WhatsApp about being targeted with spyware? Or do you have information about spyware makers? We would love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When someone contacts the helpline, Selmi told TechCrunch, its investigators first acknowledge receipt, then they do a first check to see if the person who contacted them is within the organization’s mandate, meaning if they are part of civil society — and not, for example, a business executive or lawmaker. Then, the investigators assess the case in triage. If a case is prioritized, the investigators ask questions, such as why the person believes they were targeted (if there was no notification), and what device they own, which helps to establish what kind of information the investigators may need to collect from the victim’s device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After an initial, limited check of the device performed remotely over the internet, the helpline’s handlers and investigators may ask the victim to send more data, such as a full backup of their device, to do a more thorough analysis examining for signs of intrusions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For each known kind of exploit that has been used in the last five years, we have a process on how to check that exploit,” said Selmi, referring to known hacking techniques. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We know more or less what is normal, what is not,” said Selmi.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Access Now handlers, who manage communication and often speak the victim’s language, will also give the victim advice on what to do, such as whether to get another device, or take other precautions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every case that the nonprofit looks into is unique. “It’s different from person to person, from culture to culture,” Selmi told TechCrunch. “I think we should do more research, get more people on board — not just technical people — to know how to deal with these kinds of victims.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi said that the helpline has also been supporting similar investigative teams in some regions of the world, sharing documentation, knowledge, and tools, as part of a coalition called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.civicert.org/\">CiviCERT</a>, a global network of organizations that can help members of civil society who suspect they were targeted with spyware. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Selmi said this network has also helped to reach journalists and others in places where otherwise they could not get to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“No matter where they are, [victims] have people who could talk to and report to,” Selmi told TechCrunch. “Having these people talk their language and know their context helped a lot.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label.html\">social media platforms should add warning labels</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,” Hochul said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the bill’s sponsors, Assemblymember Nily Rozic, made a similar point in a statement of his own: “New York families deserve honesty about how social media platforms impact mental health. By requiring warning labels based on the latest medical research, this law puts public health first and finally gives us the tools we need to make informed decisions.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">California lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/a-new-california-bill-would-add-warning-labels-to-social-media-platforms-233653838.html\">proposed a similar bill.</a></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/09/new-york-moves-to-limit-kids-access-to-addictive-feeds/\">New York passed laws</a> requiring that social media platforms obtain parental consent before showing children “addictive feeds” and before collecting or selling the personal data of users under 18.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This isn’t Hochul’s only end-of-year tech regulation; she also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-signs-raise-act-to-regulate-ai-safety/\">recently signed the AI safety-focused RAISE Act</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/judicial-liquidation-for-ynsect-as-insect-farming-sector-struggles-to-become-competitive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">placed into judicial liquidation</a> — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr.’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/robert-downey-jr-is-launching-a-new-rolling-venture-fund-to-back-sustainability-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FootPrint Coalition</a>, taxpayers, and many others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ultimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to <a href=\"https://www.ynsect.com/2020/10/06/agtech-startup-ynsect-extends-its-series-c-to-372-million-to-improve-global-food-security-and-sustainability-with-the-first-carbon-negative-and-largest-vertical-farm-in-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“revolutionize the food chain”</a> with insect-based protein. But don’t be too quick to attribute its failure to the “ick” factor that many Westerners feel about bugs. Human food was never its core focus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Ÿnsect focused on producing insect protein for animal feed and pet food, two markets with very different economics and margins that the company never quite chose between.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That indecision extended to its M&amp;A strategy. In 2021, Ÿnsect acquired Protifarm, a Dutch company raising mealworms for human food applications, adding a third market to the mix. Even as the company announced the deal, then-CEO Antoine Hubert <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/ynsect-acquires-mealworm-startup-protifarm-to-scale-into-human-food-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">admitted</a> it would take a couple of years for human food to represent just 10% to 15% of Ÿnsect’s revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We still see pet food and fish feed being the largest contributor to our revenues in the coming years,” Hubert declared at the time. In other words, Ÿnsect was acquiring a company in a market segment that would remain marginal for years — at a time when the startup desperately needed revenue growth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And revenue was the problem. According to publicly available data, Ÿnsect’s revenue from its main entity <a href=\"https://www.pappers.fr/entreprise/ynsect-534948617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">peaked</a> at €17.8 million in 2021 (approximately $21 million) — a figure reportedly inflated by <a href=\"https://www.zero-bullshit.fr/p/ynsect-500m-leves-pour-faire-le-ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">internal transfers</a> between subsidiaries. By 2023, the company had racked up a net loss of €79.7 million ($94 million).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So how did a company with such meager revenue raise over $600 million? The answer wasn’t hype-driven crossover funds paying ambitious multiples during the 2021 funding frenzy. Instead, Ÿnsect attracted impact-focused investors like Astanor Ventures and public investment bank <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/bpifrance-machine-powering-french-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bpifrance</a> that bought into a compelling sustainability vision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its pitch to them was simple — offering an alternative to resource-intensive proteins like fishmeal and soy. That same thesis also attracted significant capital to competitors like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/07/better-origin-series-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Better Origin</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/innovafeed-nabs-250m-to-extend-its-vertical-insect-farms-to-the-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Innovafeed</a>, and it seemed promising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the vision collided with market reality. Animal feed is a commodity market driven by price, not sustainability premiums. In a perfect world, insect protein would be fully circular, with insects fed on food waste that would otherwise go to landfill. But in practice, factory-scale insect production typically ends up <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235255092400191X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">relying</a> on cereal by-products that are already usable as animal feed — meaning insect protein just adds an expensive extra step. For animal feed, the math simply wasn’t working.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ÿnsect eventually recognized this. Pet food proved to be a different equation: It is less price-driven than animal feed and a far better market for insect protein, even with competition from other alternative proteins such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/04/lab-grown-meat-britain-eu-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lab-grown meat</a>. By 2023, the company <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/frances-ynsect-refocus-bug-business-after-capital-increase-2023-04-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">refocused its strategy</a> on pet food and other higher-margin segments, with Hubert citing broader economic pressures. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In an environment where there is inflation on energy and raw materials but also on the cost of capital and debt, we cannot afford to invest loads of resources in markets which are the least remunerative (animal feed), while you have other markets where there is a lot of demand, good returns and higher margins,” Hubert said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 2023 pivot to pet food came too late. By then, Ÿnsect had already committed to a massive, capital-intensive bet that would ultimately doom the company. That bet was Ÿnfarm, a “giga-factory” in Northern France that the company billed “the world’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/ynsect-the-makers-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-bug-farm-raises-another-224-million/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most expensive bug farm</a>.” Built for insect production at scale, the facility consumed hundreds of millions in funding — money spent before Ÿnsect had proven its business model or figured out its unit economics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To oversee Ÿnfarm’s launch, Ÿnsect brought in Shankar Krishnamoorthy, a former executive at French energy giant Engie. When that move to pet food failed to save the company, Krishnamoorthy replaced Hubert as CEO.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ÿnsect then shut down the production plant it had acquired from Protifarm and cut jobs. But shuttering one facility while operating a giga-factory built for the wrong market couldn’t solve the fundamental problem. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company ultimately failed, and in a statement following the liquidation announcement just weeks ago, its newest and last CEO, a turnaround specialist named Emmanuel Pinto, said its remaining assets are now up for grabs. “We hope that the extensive technical and industrial expertise developed by the Ynsect teams, as well as the commercial relationships they have established, will be put to productive use and make a valuable contribution both to Europe’s protein independence and to the fight against climate change,” he wrote in a statement quoted by French media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Professor Joe Haslam, who teaches a course on Scaling Up in the MBA Program at IE Business School, “Ÿnsect’s struggles are not a mystery and not mainly about insects. They are the result of a mismatch between industrial ambition, capital markets, and timing, compounded by some execution and strategy choices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that Ÿnsect failed doesn’t mean the entire insect farming sector is doomed. Competitor Innovafeed is <a href=\"https://www.courrier-picard.fr/id664027/article/2025-10-05/dans-une-filiere-de-la-proteine-dinsectes-en-difficulte-innovafeed-resiste-mieux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly holding up better</a>, in part because it started with a smaller production site and is <a href=\"https://www.lesechos.fr/start-up/next40-vivatech/de-lespoir-fou-a-la-peur-du-crash-comment-ynsect-en-est-arrive-la-2125578\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ramping up</a> incrementally. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Prof. Haslam, Ÿnsect exemplifies a broader European problem. “Ÿnsect is a case study in Europe’s scaling gap. We fund moonshots. We underfund factories. We celebrate pilots. We abandon industrialization. See <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/battery-manufacturer-northvolt-nears-the-end-as-it-files-for-bankruptcy-in-sweden/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Northvolt</a> [a struggling Swedish battery maker], <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/30/mercedes-backed-volocopter-files-for-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Volocopter</a> [a German air taxi startup], and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/electric-aircraft-startup-lilium-ceases-operations-1000-workers-laid-off/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lilium</a> [a failed German flying taxi company],” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The failure has prompted some soul-searching. Hubert himself co-founded <a href=\"https://www.startindustrie.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Start Industrie</a>, an association advocating for policies to support French industrial startups — a recognition that Europe needs more than just funding to build the next generation of deep tech companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Remote workers, who miss the everyday interactions found in an office, and younger individuals eager to create their adult social circles based on shared interests and hobbies, are among those seeking meaningful friendships.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thanks to online dating apps, the stigma associated with finding connections online has largely faded away. This has welcomed a new wave of apps focused on fostering friendships and building local communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to estimates from Appfigures, over a dozen local-focused friendship apps have collectively generated approximately $16 million in consumer spending in the U.S. so far this year. Some notable examples include Timeleft, Meet5, and Bumble’s BFF. Additionally, these apps have garnered approximately 4.3 million downloads thus far in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The apps aim to provide a less awkward solution than, for instance, approaching a stranger at the gym or local café and trying to strike up a conversation. These platforms clearly indicate that everyone using the app is looking for the same thing — friendship, not romance — making it much less intimidating to initiate conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From major players like Meetup to newer ones like 222, there are plenty of apps that cater to the growing demand for meaningful friendships. We’ve compiled a list of them for you to try out.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-222\">222</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3050909\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png 1685w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=1200,777 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=1280,829 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=430,278 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=720,466 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=900,583 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=800,518 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=1536,995 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=668,433 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=579,375 579w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=953,617 953w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=708,458 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/222app-screenshot.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>222 (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app <a href=\"https://222.place/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">222</a> is an <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/222-find-your-people/id6450612690\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iOS-only</a> social events platform that facilitates in-person meetups by pairing a group of strangers based on their personality test results. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/14/2440702/\">The app</a> sends invitations to nearby public social events, such as wine bars and comedy clubs.

Last year, some investors thought the IPO market would be back up and running by now (which didn’t quite happen), while others thought the momentum behind AI was poised to accelerate (and they were right). This year, TechCrunch did the same thing, talking to five investors from various markets about what they are preparing for in 2026.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here is what they said.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-will-it-take-for-a-founder-to-raise-next-year-compared-to-last-year\">What will it take for a founder to raise next year, compared to last year?  </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/motown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>James Norman</strong></a><strong>, Managing Partner, Black Ops VC</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Raising in 2025 requires a shift from “visionary” to “battle-tested.” In previous years, capital has been a primary moat; now investors are wary of “pilot purgatory,” where enterprises test AI solutions without an urgent need to buy. In 2026, the bar is rising. Founders must prove to VCs they have more than just traction; they need a distribution advantage. Investors are digging deeper into repeatable sales engines, proprietary workflow/processes, and deep subject matter expertise that holds up against the “capital arms race.” VCs no longer care about who’s first to market with a flashy demo. They want to know who’s building something that can last, earn trust, and scale long-term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-blumberg-6a55937a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>Morgan Blumberg</strong></a><strong>, Principal, M13</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We believe the funding markets will always be available for the best founders, but the bar will rise. At the earliest stages, especially in AI application software, I do expect fewer mega seed rounds given intense competition and capital already deployed across many categories. Founders will need to stand out with unique distribution channels or perspectives, not just by relying on a large market opportunity and strong backgrounds. Capital moats have already formed around crowded sectors. At the Series A and B stages, top-quartile rounds will require clear evidence of explosive momentum. The market has now adjusted to these expectations with increased scrutiny on the sustainability of revenue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aktaylor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>Allen Taylor</strong></a><strong>, Managing Partner, Endeavor Catalyst </strong> </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bigger, faster, better: bigger total addressable market, faster growth, better unit economics. We made 50 investments last year across 25 countries, and we expect to do more this year, so we’re seeing founders at very different stages and in very different markets. The strongest founders aren’t just showing what they’ve built so far — they’re helping investors understand where the business is going next. Real revenue and real customers still matter, but they’re not sufficient on their own. As an investor, I’m always asking: Where is this company today, and where could it realistically be in the next 12, 18, or 24 months? The founders who raise are the ones who can answer that question clearly and credibly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorothyjean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dorothy Chang</a>, Partner, Flybridge Capital </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A lot of founders are finding it easy to build new things because generative AI coding tools are so advanced today. But in truth, those tools are leveling the playing field for everyone, and competition is more fierce than ever. So founders building for venture scale need to make sure that they are (1) truly tackling a big idea, not just something that’s easy to vibe code; (2) building in a problem area that they are uniquely positioned to win; and (3) bringing something proprietary that can’t easily be replicated. This could be a contrarian approach with unique insights, proprietary access to data, deep networks/relationships, a technological advantage, etc. These aren’t new concepts, but the stakes and expectations are higher than ever.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/dawn-capitals-shamillah-bankiya-breaks-down-the-state-of-the-euro-venture-market/\">Shamillah Bankiya</a>, Partner, Dawn Capital </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For founders selling to enterprises, I think the entire world has gotten smarter on the value that AI can deliver, and as such, proving — showing line of sight to ROI — will be more important than ever to investors. Founders who can prove that their products offer much higher value have the best shot at raising capital.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-areas-are-you-looking-to-invest-in-and-why\">What areas are you looking to invest in and why? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a fund, we remain industry-agnostic generalists, but we are always sharpening our lens. Today we’re looking for “high-context founders.” In a world where AI has commoditized the ability to write code, the winning edge is now lived experience. We want to invest in the founder who has spent years in the trenches of a complex industry and possesses the bespoke expertise that can be 10x’d by AI. For us, the ideal investment is a marriage of deep subject matter expertise and a “day zero” distribution advantage, meaning founders don’t just know what to build but already know exactly who is going to buy it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We are particularly interested in sleepy or legacy industries that sit outside core tech founder appetite, where AI can offer step-change ROI that drives adoption. These markets have lower competition and moats driven by complexity that often come with less obvious sectors. We also believe 2026 will be a great year for infrastructure supporting foundational model development, as well as frontier research categories like embodied AI and world models. Healthcare remains a major focus given clear signs of buyer demand; we focus on systems of record and platforms rather than point solutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Outside the United States! The best risk-adjusted venture returns are not in Silicon Valley anymore. They are in markets like Poland, Turkey, and Greece.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you invest across 25 countries in a single year, you stop thinking of venture as something that happens in one place and then spreads outward. Twenty years ago, roughly 90% of venture dollars went to the United States. That flipped in 2018. Today, more than half of venture investment — and more than half of the world’s unicorns — are outside the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We see this every day. Founders in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia are building venture-scale companies — often serving massive markets from the start. In our pipeline, it’s normal to see founders from Venezuela building in Iraq, or from Sudan building global businesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Chang</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I’m most interested in founders who are tackling massive problems and leveraging technology for forward progress. I’m rather unmoved by the plethora of startups focused on agentically automating workflows for specific verticals. I’m much more interested in the larger platform shifts that will define this era of technological and societal progress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Bankiya </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’ve seen tremendous impact on software from AI. I think the next frontier is at the intersection of software and hardware. Most of the world’s GDP is locked up in physical industries, and software-only solutions aren’t enough to fully unlock the world’s growth potential.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-think-the-ipo-market-will-thaw-why-or-why-not\">Do you think the IPO market will thaw? Why or why not? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes, the IPO market is likely to thaw, not because conditions are suddenly ideal, but because the system is running out of viable alternatives. We’re approaching a tipping point where the private market’s ability to sustain multibillion-dollar valuations, often disconnected from profitability or liquidity, is wearing thin. Years of “paper markups” have postponed reality, but they haven’t eliminated it. Companies, boards, and late-stage investors increasingly need a mechanism to reset expectations, generate real liquidity, and re-establish price discovery. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Private credit has acted as a stopgap, extending runways without forcing valuation discipline. But that bridge is starting to look more like a pressure cooker. Debt can delay decisions, not solve structural capital needs, especially for companies built for equity-style growth. At some point, fresh capital becomes necessary, and public markets remain the only place capable of providing it at scale. Their growth narratives and strategic importance can provide the “air cover” needed to reopen the IPO window. Once investors re-engage around category-defining leaders, it creates permission for the broader high-growth software sector to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think we will see a reopening of the IPO markets driven by the backlog of companies planning to list. Many large tech IPOs are anticipated, including darlings like Anthropic and OpenAI, and I believe one of these mega IPOs will drive considerable momentum for others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes — 2026 will be a big year for IPOs in New York as dozens of the top companies simply decide “it’s time.” It will also be a banner year for tech IPOs in places folks are not used to seeing them — like the stock market in Saudi Arabia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think people underestimate how global the thaw will be. We’ve had nearly four years of muted IPO activity, which has created a backlog of high-quality companies that are ready to be public. When the window opens, it won’t just be U.S. companies stepping through it. There’s already a cohort of major U.S.-listed technology companies from Latin America, including MercadoLibre and Nubank, and there’s another wave right behind them that public-market investors haven’t fully priced in yet. I don’t think all of those companies list in 2026, but several will. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s even more unexpected is what happens locally. You’re going to see meaningful technology IPOs in places like Saudi Arabia, listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). When companies like Tabby [a buy now, pay later outfit] go public locally, it will challenge assumptions about where global tech outcomes happen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Chang </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re looking to make slightly fewer, more concentrated bets. There is a ton of startup activity, so when we meet founders who really stand out, we want to be able to back up our high conviction with a higher check size and higher ownership percentage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Bankyia</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I think a hard catalyst would be required to reset the IPO markets — something akin to mega AI players facing unprecedented cost increases or sharp revenue declines. Think, for example, of energy prices sharply rising, such that it’s unaffordable to offer compute for AI training and inference.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-are-you-looking-at-the-venture-market-for-next-year-as-a-fund-manager\">How are you looking at the venture market for next year as a fund manager? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re entering what I’d describe as a clearing event for the venture market, and next year will separate durable platforms from transient ones. The fallout will hit Fund I managers who haven’t found their footing, and active Fund II managers struggling with a [distributions-paid-in-capital, or DPI] drought from 2021 vintages. Traditional institutional anchors, particularly university endowments, are effectively in repair mode. After being squeezed by the absence of liquidity in 2021 and 2022, many are leaning on secondaries, pacing adjustments, and portfolio-smoothing strategies just to maintain existing commitments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That means fewer new relationships and far less tolerance for emerging or undifferentiated managers. Stepping into their place are family offices that have moved from passive LP roles to active market forces. They aren’t just filling the “LP oxygen” left by retreating institutions; they are scoping direct mandates and using [registered investment advisors] to hunt for unique, high-conviction strategies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2026, there is no viable middle ground. You need to have a clinical, defensible track record and/or truly unfair access to differentiated deal flow. Lightly grounded generalist positioning, soft networks, and “good enough” performance won’t survive this cycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We believe we are in the early innings of AI transformation, so we expect next year to be a strong vintage. Capital continues to concentrate in a select number of winners so we focus on being selective and operationally supporting our companies to earn our right to concentrate. We are advising our portfolio companies to strengthen their balance sheets in case of a downturn in 2026 while focusing on building for the long term rather than optimizing for fast funding.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazing time to back the boldest founders building for the next 10+ years! From a fund manager’s perspective, 2026 looks strong on both deployment and liquidity. Last year we had 12 liquidity events — all through M&amp;A and secondaries. That matters because venture has grown dramatically over the last two decades, while paths to liquidity didn’t keep pace. What’s changing now is that venture is building a more complete liquidity toolkit — M&amp;A, secondaries, and IPOs working together. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s critical when founders are committing 10, 15, even 20 years to building companies. At the same time, we’re seeing real structural shifts in core sectors. Financial technology, especially stablecoins, moved from experimentation to mainstream adoption in 2025, particularly in markets like Latin America and Africa. In those places, this isn’t speculative technology; it’s infrastructure. That combination is why 2026 looks like a strong year to be deploying capital.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Bankyia</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We’re still searching for phenomenal European founders building groundbreaking companies. Great companies are formed in all cycles.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-will-happen-to-all-the-investor-and-startup-interest-in-ai-next-year\">What will happen to all the investor and startup interest in AI next year? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2026, the “AI curiosity” that fueled the last two years is being replaced by a demand for application and scale. We are moving from the era of building models to the era of building businesses. The fastest, most innovative companies aren’t the ones with the largest LLMs; they are the ones using AI to solve high-value, domain-specific problems that were previously too complex or too manual to scale. Investors aren’t looking for “AI startups” anymore; we’re looking for exceptional tech founders who have found a way to use this intelligence to 10x the efficiency of a massive, traditional market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg </strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We expect investor and startup interest to continue at all-time highs. However, I do think we will start to see tuck-in acquisitions, acquihires, and wind-downs in highly concentrated sectors such as coding automation, sales automation, marketing, and advertising as market share starts to concentrate in select assets.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It will continue. But by the end of 2026, I predict AI will stop being a separate category, as it will just be a part of all new technology companies being built. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a lot of breathless talk about AI right now — and that’s understandable. We’re still very early in understanding what this technology will actually change. In moments like this, excitement tends to run ahead of clarity. Some companies will be transformational, many won’t, and pricing will take time to adjust as real use cases emerge. The opportunity isn’t in labeling everything as “AI.” It’s in understanding where AI meaningfully changes cost structures, speed, or decision-making inside real businesses. That’s where durable value gets created.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is one of those moments when the fog is thick, and that’s when outcomes diverge the most. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Chang </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I don’t see it slowing down anytime soon. We’ve seen a lot of dollars go into infrastructure and theory; this year we’ll see a lot more of that investment more clearly turn into enterprise value at the application level.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Bankyia</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AI will remain a hot topic, barring negative hard catalysts that dramatically change conditions, like an energy crisis or a rise in default rates.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-something-unexpected-that-could-happen-in-2026-in-the-world-of-venture-and-startups\">What is something unexpected that could happen in 2026 in the world of venture and startups? </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Norman </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the most unexpected shifts of 2026 will be the quiet end of the “ChatGPT-first” era in startups. Not because generative AI loses importance, but because no single model remains the default starting point. GPT is no longer consistently best-in-class for search, image generation, or video, which fundamentally changes how tech companies architect their products. The savvy founders in 2026 have already graduated to a multi-model world, and instead their focus has shifted to specialization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, Anthropic has effectively captured the developer’s mindshare because Claude Code is better at building with you, and Google has finally activated its structural advantages. With Gemini 3, it’s pairing top-tier image and video generation with deep multimodal capability and native access to Google’s search and data ecosystem. That combination is proving hard to compete with. Model choice becomes an infrastructure decision, not a moat. The winners in 2026 won’t be the companies that “use GPT,” but the ones that orchestrate multiple models seamlessly, abstract complexity away from users, and build proprietary workflows on top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Blumberg </strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We expect to see many successful startups built with only one or two rounds of capital. AI tooling (especially coding automation) enables many early-stage companies to accomplish profitability without excessive burn. From a technology perspective, while LLMs are expected to be everywhere, companies will start to scale back usage in favor of more controlled use as enterprises prioritize explainability, cost, and reliability. This could drive heavier use of small models, deterministic and probabilistic hybrid models, world models, or simulation modeling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Taylor</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end of the Russia-Ukraine war will bring about a renaissance of investing in Ukrainian founders, who are some of the best in the world! Two additional things will genuinely surprise people. First, international companies — especially from Latin America — going public in New York at scale. Second, major technology IPOs coming out of the Middle East, listed locally. When companies like Tabby go public on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), it will reset expectations about where global tech leadership lives.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Finding a chemical-free way to kill weeds seemed like a solid option.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the laser was a dead end. There’s too much risk of starting a fire, he told TechCrunch in an interview. After a lot of trial and error prototyping with ideas like cryogenics, the solution he settled on — which he <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/startup-battlefield/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">showed off </a>earlier this year at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-disrupt-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a> — is steam.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boysen’s company has developed a system that uses computer vision to spot weeds in lawns and fields and golf courses, and kill them with nothing but vaporized water. It can be attached to mowers, or tractors, or even ATVs. At the moment, Naware is flexible, and Boysen is visibly eager for his idea to spread fast — much like the weeds he’s trying to kill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a world of agentic AI and billion-dollar software companies, Naware stands out as a classic garage startup story. Boysen said his team first tested the use of steam by ordering a “rinky dink” garment steamer off of Amazon. After that, they ordered seven more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re not real industrial,” Boysen said. “And so there’s a lot of research helping to develop that, to get to the point of: ‘How do we make this effective and make it repeatable so it can scale?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Developing the steamer tech was one challenge, but the bigger one may have been identifying the weeds, Boysen said. It’s well-established that artificial intelligence software can be trained to accurately recognize objects or patterns, but the “green-on-green” problem was tough, he said — especially because the software has to recognize the weeds in real time while the rig is prowling over a lawn. (And yes, it’s using Nvidia GPUs.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He thinks they’ve gotten there, though. He said Naware is targeting companies that do lawn care for athletic fields and golf courses, and claims his company can save customers like that “anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000 on chemicals alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, he said customers will save money by not having to pay for people whose only job is to spray those chemicals. Naware has been doing paid pilots to test and dial in the product, but Boysen’s pitch has already attracted prospective partners, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re going after the strategic partnerships. We’re in discussions with $5 billion companies that do equipment manufacturing that are interested in our product. And we’re a couple conversations into that — I can’t say their name, but you’ll figure it out,” he laughed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Success, Boysen said, will take three things: those partnerships, securing patents, and funding. Boysen has been bootstrapping Naware for now but said he’ll open its first fundraising round in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve got to get a funding round that just crushes anybody else trying to think about it,” he said. “I’ve got to deliver the promise that I can kill weeds, and it’s effective. And we’ll make it work. I’m not concerned about that.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In short, if you turn your head, the virtual screen stays in place rather than moving with you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They feature a built-in button array that lets you quickly change your screen size, distance, color temperature, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3047045\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Black-with-PRIZM-24K-Lens10.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-its-new-oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-for-athletes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses</a> are the best option for outdoorsy people and athletes, as they were specifically designed with them in mind.

They offer impressive visuals and features for the price and are great for light gaming or watching content on long journeys. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They feature micro‑OLED displays that create a virtual 201‑inch screen at 1080p resolution, with a 120 Hz refresh rate, a 46-degree field of view, and about 650 nits of perceived brightness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the field of view is narrower than some premium models and they don’t have head tracking, they’re a good option for people who simply want an external display on the go without breaking the bank. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The glasses use a micro‑OLED “HueView” display with eye protection features like 3840 Hz hybrid dimming and low blue‑light certification to reduce eye strain during extended use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The RayNeo Air 3s cost $269 (currently on sale for $219). </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-upcoming-launches-to-keep-your-eye-on\">Upcoming launches to keep your eye on</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Project Aura:</strong> Google and Xreal are collaborating <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/googles-first-ai-glasses-expected-next-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">on a pair of Android XR-powered glasses</a> that are equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology.

There are now dozens of journalists who cover cybersecurity in the English language. There are a lot of stories about cybersecurity, privacy, and surveillance that are published every week. And a lot of them are great, and you should read them. We’re here to recommend the ones we liked the most, so keep in mind that it’s a very subjective and, at the end of the day, incomplete list. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyway, let’s get into it. <em>— Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai</em></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-shane-harris-described-how-he-cultivated-a-senior-iranian-hacker-as-a-source-who-was-then-killed\">Shane Harris described how he cultivated a senior Iranian hacker as a source, who was then killed</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every once in a while, there’s a hacker story that as soon as you start reading, you think it could be a movie or a TV show. This is the case with <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/01/mohammad-tajik-iran-cyber-intelligence/684954/?gift=kPTlqn0J1iP9IBZcsdI5IUTLJcsVKq12m0EyVlSYJBQ&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Shane Harris’ very personal tale of his months-long correspondence with a top Iranian hacker</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2016, The Atlantic’s journalist made contact with a person claiming to work as a hacker for Iran’s intelligence, where he claimed to have worked on major operations, such as the downing of an American drone and the now-infamous hack against oil giant Saudi Aramco, where Iranian hackers wiped the company’s computers. Harris was rightly skeptical, but as he kept talking to the hacker, who eventually revealed his real name to him, Harris started to believe him. When the hacker died, Harris was able to piece together the real story, which somehow turned out to be more incredible than the hacker had led Harris to believe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The gripping story is also a great behind-the-scenes look at the challenges cybersecurity reporters face when dealing with sources claiming to have great stories to share.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-washington-post-revealed-a-secret-order-demanding-apple-let-u-k-officials-spy-on-users-encrypted-data\">The Washington Post revealed a secret order demanding Apple let U.K. officials spy on users’ encrypted data</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.K. government secretly issued Apple with a court order</a> demanding that the company build a back door so police can access the iCloud data of any customer in the world. Due to a worldwide gag order, it was only because <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post</a> broke the news that we learned the order existed to begin with. The demand was the first of its kind, and — if successful — would be a major defeat for tech giants who have spent the past decade locking themselves out of their users’ own data so they can’t be compelled to provide it to governments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple subsequently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-icloud-end-to-end-encryption-feature-for-uk-users-after-government-demanded-backdoor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stopped offering its opt-in end-to-end encrypted cloud storage</a> to its customers in the U.K. in response to the demand. But by breaking the news, the secret order was thrust into the public eye and allowed both Apple and critics to scrutinize U.K. surveillance powers in a way that hasn’t been tested in public before. The story sparked a months-long diplomatic row between the U.K. and the United States, prompting Downing Street to drop the request — only to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/uk-government-tries-again-to-access-encrypted-apple-customer-data-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">try again</a> several months later.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans-by-the-atlantic-is-this-year-s-best-headline\">“The Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans” by The Atlantic is this year’s best headline</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This story was the sort of fly-on-the-wall access that some reporters would dream of, but <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/\">The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief got to play out in real time</a> after he was unwittingly added to a Signal group of senior U.S. government officials <em>by </em>a senior U.S. government official discussing war plans on their cell phones. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/clean-on-opsec.jpg\" alt='a screenshot from the leaked Signal chat, which reads (from Pete Hegseth): \"MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline) We are currently clean on OPSEC.

In this case, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/meet-rey-the-admin-of-scattered-lapsus-hunters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Krebs was able to find the real identity behind a hacker’s online handle Rey</a>, who is part of the notorious <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/the-biggest-underestimated-security-threat-of-today-advanced-persistent-teenagers/\">advanced persistent teenagers</a>‘ cybercrime group that calls itself Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Krebs’ quest was so successful that he was able to talk to a person very close to the hacker — we won’t spoil the whole article here — and then the hacker himself, who confessed to his crimes and claimed he was trying to escape the cybercriminal life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Independent media outlet 404 Media has accomplished more impact journalism this year than most mainstream outlets with vastly more resources.

Luigi Mangione, the chief suspect in the killing, was soon after arrested and indicted on charges of using a “ghost gun,” a 3D-printed firearm that had no serial numbers and built in private without a background check — effectively a gun that the government has no idea exists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wired, using its <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/06/i-made-an-untraceable-ar-15-ghost-gun/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">past reporting experience on 3D-printed weaponry</a>, sought to test how easy it would be to build a 3D-printed gun, while navigating the patchwork legal (and ethical) landscape. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-ghost-gun-built-tested/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The reporting process was exquisitely told</a>, and the video that goes along with the story is both excellent and chilling.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I 3D-Printed Luigi Mangione’s ‘Ghost Gun’ | Hacklab | WIRED\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tQB_ib-KQXA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-npr-detailed-a-federal-whistleblower-s-account-of-how-doge-took-sensitive-government-data-and-the-threats-he-faced\">NPR detailed a federal whistleblower’s account of how DOGE took sensitive government data, and the threats he faced</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency, was one of the biggest running stories of the year, as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/the-people-in-elon-musk-doge-universe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the gang of Elon Musk’s lackeys</a> ripped through the federal government, tearing down security protocols and red tape, as part of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/doge-biggest-breach-of-united-states-government-data-under-way/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mass-grab</a> of citizens’ data.

This story explored the shadowy world of phone surveillance by exploiting Signaling System No. 7, or SS7, an obscurely named protocol long known to allow malicious tracking.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wired-reported-on-the-investigation-behind-a-string-of-swatting-attacks-on-hundreds-of-schools-nationwide\">Wired reported on the investigation behind a string of “swatting” attacks on hundreds of schools nationwide</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swatting has been a problem for years.

Swatting is a type of hoax where someone — often a hacker — calls the emergency services and tricks the authorities into sending an armed SWAT team to the home of the hoaxer’s target, often pretending to be the target themselves and pretending they are about to commit a violent crime. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In this feature, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/school-swatting-torswats-brad-dennis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wired’s Andy Greenberg put a face on the many characters who are part of these stories</a>, such as the call operators who have to deal with this problem.

But the challenge of defeating it sparked Quintero’s passion for cybersecurity, eventually leading him to found <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">VirusTotal</a>, a startup that Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/google-acquires-online-virus-malware-and-url-scanner-virustotal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">acquired</a> in 2012. That acquisition brought Google’s flagship European cybersecurity center to Málaga, transforming the Spanish city into a tech hub.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All because of a small malware program created by someone whose identity Quintero had never known. Moved by nostalgia and gratitude, Quintero launched a search earlier this year. He asked Spanish media outlets to amplify his quest for tips. He dove back into the virus’s code, looking for clues his 18-year-old self might have missed. And he eventually solved the mystery, sharing the bittersweet resolution in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bernardo-quintero-49697b2_hace-una-semana-anunciamos-internamente-que-activity-7333016670971527170-8WP3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn post</a> that went viral.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The story begins in 1992, when a young Quintero was prompted by a teacher to create an antivirus for the 2610-byte program that had spread across the computers of Málaga’s Polytechnic School. “That challenge in my first year at university sparked a deep interest in computer viruses and security, and without it my path might have been very different,” Quintero told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quintero’s search was aided by his programmer instincts. Earlier this year, he <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bernardo-quintero-49697b2_hace-una-semana-anunciamos-internamente-que-activity-7333016670971527170-8WP3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGZRmIBCSYQ4pxqFfJCbL8VLX2lCR4QLso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stepped down</a> from his team manager role to “go back to the cave, to the basement of Google.” He didn’t leave the company; instead, he went back to <a href=\"https://www.diariosur.es/tecnologia/sotano-google-bernardo-quintero-equipo-veinteaneros-cocinan-20250912124931-nt.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tinkering and experimenting</a> without managerial duties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That tinkering mindset also led him to reexamine Virus Málaga and look for details he’d missed years earlier. First, he found fragments of a signature, but thanks to another security expert, he discovered a later variant of the virus with a much clearer cue: “KIKESOYYO.” “Kike soy yo” would translate to “I am Kike,” a common nickname for “Enrique.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around the same time, Quintero received a direct message from a man who is now the general digital transformation coordinator for the Spanish city of Cordoba and who claimed he witnessed one of his Polytechnic School classmates create the virus. Many details added up, but one stood out in particular: The man knew that the virus’s hidden message — called a payload, in cybersecurity terms — was a statement condemning the Basque terrorist group ETA, a fact that Quintero had never disclosed.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tipster then gave Quintero a name — Antonio Astorga — but also shared the news that he had passed away. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This hit Quintero like a ton of bricks; now, he would never be able to ask Antonio about “Kike.” But he kept following the thread, and the plot twist came from Antonio’s sister, who revealed that his first name was actually Antonio Enrique. To his family, he was Kike.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cancer took away Antonio Enrique Astorga before Quintero could thank him in person, but the story doesn’t stop here. Quintero’s LinkedIn post sheds new light to the legacy of “a brilliant colleague who deserves to be recognized as a pioneer of cybersecurity in Málaga” — and not just for helping Quintero discover his vocation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to his friend, Astorga’s virus had no other goal than to spread his anti-terrorist message and proving himself as a programmer. Mirroring Quintero’s path, Astorga’s interest in IT endured, and he became a computing teacher at a secondary school that named its IT classroom after him in his memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Astorga’s legacy also lives on beyond these walls, and not just through his students. One of his sons, Sergio, is a recent software engineering graduate with an interest in cybersecurity and quantum computing — a meaningful connection for Quintero. “Being able to close that circle now, and to see new generations building on it, is deeply meaningful to me,” Quintero said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Quintero, who suspects their paths will cross again, Sergio is “very representative of the talent being formed in Málaga today.” This, in turn, is a result of VirusTotal forming the root of what eventually <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/new-cybersecurity-center-in-malaga/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">became the Google Safety Engineering Center</a> (<a href=\"https://safety.google/intl/en/safety/engineering-center/malaga/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">GSEC</a>) and spearheading collaborations with the University of Málaga that made the city a true cybersecurity talent hub.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Long the invisible but critical backbone of the internet, server farms have rarely been a point of interest for folks outside of the tech industry, let alone an issue of particularly captivating political resonance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Well, as of 2025, it would appear those days are officially over. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past 12 months, data centers have inspired protests in dozens of states, as regional activists have sought to combat America’s ever-increasing compute buildup. Data Center Watch, an organization tracking anti-data center activism, <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">writes that</a> there are currently 142 different activist groups across 24 states that are organizing against data center developments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Activists have a variety of concerns: the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/\">environmental</a> and potential <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/data-center-boom-risks-health-of-already-vulnerable-communities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">health impacts</a> of these projects, the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91444129/data-centers-surge-ai-boom-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">controversial ways</a> in which AI is being used, and, most importantly, the fact that so many new additions to America’s power grid may be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/rising-energy-prices-put-ai-and-data-centers-in-the-crosshairs/\">driving up local electricity bills</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such a sudden populist uprising appears to be a natural response to an industry that has grown so quickly that it’s now showing up in people’s backyards. Indeed, as the AI industry has swelled to dizzying heights, so, too, has the cloud computing business. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/look-forward/data-center-frontiers/data-center-risk-if-ai-promises-fade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shows that</a>, since 2021, construction spending on data centers has skyrocketed a stunning 331%. Spending on these projects totals in the hundreds of billions of dollars. So many new data centers have been proposed in recent months that many experts believe that a majority of them will not — <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/a-fraction-of-proposed-data-centers-will-get-built-utilities-are-wising-up/748214/\">and, indeed, could not possibly</a> — be built.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This buildout shows no signs of slowing down in the meantime. Major tech giants — including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/31/tech-ai-google-meta-amazon-microsoft-spend.html#:~:text=As%20big%20as%20the%20spending,Inside%20India\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">all announced</a> significant capital expenditure projections for the new year, a majority of which will likely go toward such projects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New AI infrastructure isn’t just being pushed by Silicon Valley but by Washington, D.C., where the Trump administration has made artificial intelligence a central plank of its agenda. The Stargate Project, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/openai-teams-up-with-softbank-and-oracle-on-50b-data-center-project/\">announced</a> in January, set the stage for 2025’s massive AI infrastructure buildout by <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">heralding a supposed</a> “re-industrialization of the United States.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the process of scaling itself exponentially, an industry that once had little public exposure has suddenly been thrust into the limelight — and is now suffering backlash. Danny Cendejas, an activist with the nonprofit MediaJustice, has been personally involved in a number of actions against data centers, including a protest that took place in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year, where locals came out to decry the <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/how-mediajustice-is-leading-communities-to-push-back-against-ai-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expansion of Colossus</a>, a project from Elon Musk’s startup, xAI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cendejas told TechCrunch that he meets new people every week who express interest in organizing against a data center in their community. “I don’t think this is going to stop anytime soon,” he said. “I think it’s going to keep building, and we’re going to see more wins — more projects are going to be stopped.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Evidence in support of Cendejas’ assessment is everywhere you look. Across the country, communities have reacted to newly announced server farms in much the same way the average person might react to the presence of a highly contagious plague. In Michigan, for instance, where developers are currently <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/12/at-least-16-sites-eyed-for-data-centers-in-michigan-amid-ai-boom-heres-where.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eyeing 16 different locations</a> for potential data center construction, protesters recently descended upon the state’s capitol, <a href=\"https://www.wilx.com/2025/12/16/data-center-protest-outside-michigan-capitol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">saying things like</a>: “Michiganders do not want data centers in our yards, in our communities.” Meanwhile, in Wisconsin — another development hot spot — angry locals appear to have recently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/25/microsoft-ai-data-center-rejection-vs-support.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dissuaded Microsoft</a> from using their town as a headquarters for a new 244-acre data center. In Southern California, the tiny city of Imperial Valley recently <a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/environment/2025/12/12/imperial-valley-city-sues-to-force-environmental-review-of-massive-data-center-project\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">filed a lawsuit</a> to overturn its county’s approval of a data center project, expressing environmental concerns as the rationale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The discontent surrounding these projects has gotten so intense that politicians believe it could make or break particular candidates at the ballot box. In November, it was reported that rising electricity costs — which many believe are being driven by the AI boom — could become <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2026-election-utility-bills-ai-data-centers-13703f61d1397612fd067e69b9093116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a critical issue</a> that determines the 2026 midterm elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The whole connection to everybody’s energy bills going up — I think that’s what’s really made this an issue that is so stark for people,” Cendejas told TechCrunch. “So many of us are struggling month to month. Meanwhile, there’s this huge expansion of data centers…[People are wondering] Where is all that money coming from? How are our local governments giving away subsidies and public funds to incentivize these projects, when there’s so much need in our communities?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In some cases, protests appear to be working and even halting (if only temporarily) planned developments. Data Center Watch <a href=\"https://www.datacenterwatch.org/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims that</a> some $64 billion worth of developments have been blocked or delayed as the result of grassroots opposition. Cendejas is certainly a believer in the idea that organized action can halt companies in their tracks. “All this public pressure is working,” he said, noting that he could sense a “very palpable anger” around the issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, the tech industry is fighting back. Earlier this month, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/data-centers-have-a-political-problem-and-big-tech-wants-to-fix-it-00693695\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a> a relatively new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has been “distributing talking points to members of Congress and organizing local data center field trips to better pitch voters on their value.” Tech companies, including Meta, have been taking out ad campaigns to sell voters on the economic benefits of data centers, the outlet wrote. In short: The tech industry’s AI hopes are pegged to a compute buildout of epic proportions, so for now it’s safe to say that in 2026 the server surge will continue, as will the backlash and polarization that surround it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the actual data on the state of the region’s venture market shows a different reality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The upshot: The European market has not recovered from the global venture capital reset that occurred in 2022 and 2023. But there is evidence it is on the cusp of a turnaround, including Klarna’s recent exit and the region’s homegrown AI startups garnering attention from local investors and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors poured €43.7 billion ($52.3 billion) into European startups in 2025 across 7,743 deals through the third quarter, according to PitchBook data. That means the yearly total is on pace to match — not exceed — the €62.1 billion invested in 2024 and €62.3 billion in 2023. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, U.S. venture deal volume in 2025 had already surpassed 2022, 2023, and 2024 by the end of the third quarter, according to PitchBook data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Deal recovery isn’t Europe’s biggest problem, though — it’s VC firm fundraising. Through Q3 2025, European VC firms raised a mere €8.3 billion ($9.7 billion), which puts Europe on track for its lowest overall fundraising yearly total in a decade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fundraising, LP to GP, is definitely the weakest area within Europe,” Navina Rajan, a senior analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “We’re on track for around 50% to 60% decline in the first nine months of this year. A lot of that is made up now by emerging managers versus experienced firms, and the mega funds that closed last year haven’t repeated this year.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Rajan doesn’t share the same fever that oozed out of attendees at Slush, she pointed to a few positive data points that suggest the European market is turning around.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For one, the participation of U.S. investors in European startup deals is back on the rise. Rajan said that figure dipped to a low in 2023 when U.S.-based VCs participated in just 19% of European venture deals. It has been steadily on the rise since, she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They seem pretty optimistic on the European market,” Rajan said. “Just from an entry point of view, because you think about valuations, especially within AI tech and in the U.S., it’s just impossible to get in now, whereas, if you’re in Europe and your multiples are lower, and you’re new as an investor, it just provides a better entry point for perhaps similar tech.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable is one example of this shift. Vibe-coding companies have raised a lot of VC money in the United States. But U.S. investors also clearly love Lovable. The company just announced a new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/vibe-coding-startup-lovable-raises-330m-at-a-6-6b-valuation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$330 million Series B round</a> that was both led by and participated in by a slew of U.S.-based VCs, including Salesforce Ventures, CapitalG, and Menlo Ventures, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">French AI research lab Mistral has seen similar love from U.S.-based firms. <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-raises-1-7-b-to-accelerate-technological-progress-with-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mistral landed a €1.7 billion Series C round</a> in September that included Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, and Lightspeed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Klarna’s recent exit also suggests a turnaround is underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Swedish fintech giant <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/klarnas-ipo-pops-raising-1-4b-with-sequoia-as-the-biggest-winner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Klarna went public</a> in September after raising $6.2 billion across two decades in the private market. That exit likely recycled some capital back to European LPs or gave them confidence in a changing exit environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Victor Englesson, a partner at Swedish EQT, the recent European success stories, like Klarna, have started to change how founders in Europe approach building their companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ambitious founders have seen what great looks like in companies like Spotify, Klarna, Revolut and are now starting companies with that type of ambition,” Englesson told TechCrunch. They’re not starting companies with like, I want to win in Europe, or I want to win in Germany. They start companies with a mindset that I want to win globally. I don’t think we have seen that to the same extent before.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That mindset has EQT, and others, bullish on Europe. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“For EQT, we’ve invested $120 billion in Europe [over the] last five years,” Englesson said. “We’re going to invest $250 billion [over the] next five years in Europe. So we are extremely committed to Europe.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
