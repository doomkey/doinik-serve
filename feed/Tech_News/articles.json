It’s a move sure to turn heads in Silicon Valley.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Why? Because venture capital firms have historically avoided backing competing companies in the same sector, preferring to place their bets on a single winner. Yet here’s Sequoia, already invested in both OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, now throwing its weight behind Anthropic, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing is particularly surprising given what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said under oath last year. As part of OpenAI’s defense against Musk’s lawsuit, Altman addressed rumors about restrictions in OpenAI’s 2024 funding round. While he denied that OpenAI investors were broadly prohibited from backing rivals, he did acknowledge that investors with ongoing access to OpenAI’s confidential information were told that access would be terminated “if they made non-passive investments in OpenAI’s competitors.” Altman called this “industry standard” protection (which it is) against misuse of competitively-sensitive information.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the FT, Sequoia is joining a funding round led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, who are each contributing $1.5 billion. Anthropic is aiming to raise $25 billion or more at a $350 billion valuation — more than double its $170 billion valuation from just four months ago. The WSJ and Bloomberg had earlier reported the round at $10 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have committed up to $15 billion combined, with VCs and other investors said to be contributing another $10 billion or more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Sequoia connection with Altman runs deep. When Altman dropped out of Stanford to start Loopt, Sequoia backed him. He later became a “scout” for Sequoia, introducing the firm to Stripe, which became one of the firm’s most valuable portfolio companies. Sequoia’s new co-leader Alfred Lin and Altman also appear comparatively close. Lin has interviewed Altman numerous times at Sequoia events, and when Altman was briefly ousted from OpenAI in November 2023, Lin publicly said he’d eagerly back Altman’s “next world-changing company.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Sequoia’s investment in xAI might seem to have already contradicted the traditional VC approach of picking winners, that bet is widely viewed as less about backing an OpenAI competitor and more about deepening the firm’s extensive ties to Elon Musk. Sequoia invested in X when Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it, is an investor in SpaceX and The Boring Company, and is a major backer of Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company. Longtime Sequoia leader Michael Moritz was even an early investor in Musk’s X.com, which became part of PayPal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sequoia’s apparent reversal on portfolio conflicts is especially glaring given its historical stance. In 2020, the firm took the extraordinary step of walking away from its investment in payments company Finix after determining the startup competed with Stripe. Sequoia <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/\">forfeited its $21 million investment</a>, letting Finix keep the money while giving up its board seat, information rights, and shares, marking the first time in the firm’s history it had severed ties with a newly funded company over a conflict of interest. (Sequoia had led Finix’s $35 million Series B round just months earlier.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The reported Anthropic investment comes after dramatic leadership changes at Sequoia, where Roelof Botha was pushed out in a surprise vote just <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38m7mp8bngg\">days after sitting down</a> with this editor at TechCrunch Disrupt, with Lin and Pat Grady — who’d led that Finix deal —  taking over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO that could come as soon as this year.

As you might recall, the newsletter took a little holiday break. We’re back and well into 2026. And a lot has happened since the last edition. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I spent the first week of the year at the <strong>Consumer Electronics Show</strong> in Las Vegas. And while I wrote about this <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/ces-2025-where-have-all-the-us-automakers-gone/\">last January</a>, it’s worth repeating: U.S. automakers have left the building. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What has filled the void in the Las Vegas Convention Center? Autonomous vehicle tech companies (<strong>Zoox</strong>, <strong>Tensor Auto</strong>, <strong>Tier IV</strong>, and <strong>Waymo</strong>, which <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/waymo-is-rebranding-its-zeekr-robotaxi/\">rebranded its Zeekr RT</a>, to name a few), Chinese automakers like <strong>Geely</strong> and <strong>GWM</strong>, software and automotive chip companies, and loads of what <strong>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang</strong> calls “physical AI.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The term, which is sometimes called “embodied AI,” describes the use of AI outside the digital world and into the real, physics-based one. AI models, combined with sensors, cameras, and the motorized controls, allow that physical thing — humanoid robot, drone, autonomous forklift, robotaxi — to detect and understand what’s in this real environment and make decisions to operate within it. And it was all over the place from agriculture and robotics to autonomous vehicles and drones, industrial manufacturing, and wearables. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Hyundai</strong> had one of the busiest and largest exhibits with a near-constant line wrapped around the entrance. The Korean automaker wasn’t showing cars. Nope, it was robots of various forms, including the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/boston-dynamicss-next-gen-humanoid-robot-will-have-google-deepmind-dna/\">Atlas humanoid robot</a>, courtesy of its subsidiary <strong>Boston Dynamics</strong>. There were also innovations that have come out of <strong>Hyundai Motor Group Robotics LAB</strong>, including a robot that charges electric autonomous vehicles, and a four-wheel electric platform called the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobEd) that is going into production this year. It seems everyone was embracing and showcasing robotics, particularly humanoids. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The hype around humanoids, specifically, and physical AI, in general, was palpable. I asked <strong>Mobileye </strong>co-founder and president <strong>Amnon Shashua</strong> about this because his company just bought his humanoid robotics startup for $900 million: “What do you say when people tell you humanoid robots are all hype?” </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The internet was also a hype, remember in 2000, the crisis of the internet,” Shashua said. “It did not mean that [the] internet is not a real thing. Hype means that companies are overvalued for a certain period of time, and then they crash. It does not mean that the domain is not real. I believe that the domain of humanoids is real.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>A few notable stories from CES</strong>:<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-launches-alpamayo-open-ai-models-that-allow-autonomous-vehicles-to-think-like-a-human/\">Nvidia launches Alpamayo, open AI models that allow autonomous vehicles to ‘think like a human’</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/this-is-ubers-new-robotaxi-from-lucid-and-nuro/\">This is Uber’s new robotaxi from Lucid and Nuro</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/mobileye-acquires-humanoid-robot-startup-mentee-robotics-for-900m/\">Mobileye acquires humanoid robot startup Mentee Robotics for $900M</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now onto the other non-CES and more recent news … </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Trump made comments this week at a Detroit Economic Club meeting about welcoming Chinese automakers into the United States that did not sit well with many in the auto industry, according to insiders I have spoken to. Specifically, I have been told the <strong>Alliance for Automotive Innovation</strong> (the industry lobbying group) is “freaking out,” one DC insider told me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great, I love that,” Trump said, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/an-trump-detroit-economic-club-0113/?utm_id=gfta-ur-260114&amp;share-code=A2NSPIE6XVCCTJYBY5MO54X5WI&amp;user_id=4532198&amp;customer_secondary_source=aac_articleGifting\">according to reporters</a> in attendance. “Let China come in, let Japan come in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A couple of notes. Japanese companies like <strong>Toyota</strong> are already very much in the United States. The bigger hurdle, beyond protests from within the boardrooms of U.S. automakers, is existing law. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule that <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bis.gov/connected-vehicles\">restricts the import and sale</a> of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia. This essentially bans the sale of Chinese vehicles in the country. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Avery Ash</strong>, who is CEO of <strong>SAFE</strong>, a nonpartisan organization focused on securing U.S. energy, critical materials, and supply chains, weighed in about the dangers of allowing Chinese automakers to sell their vehicles in the United States. Side note: Ash was on my podcast, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.autonocast.com/blog/2026/1/2/353-annual-prediction-episode-wsafe-ceo-avery-ash\">the Autonocast</a>, which touches on some of this subject.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Welcoming Chinese automakers to build cars here in the U.S. will reverse these hard-won accomplishments and put Americans at risk,” <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://secureenergy.org/statement-chineseautomanufacturing-reversehardwongains/\">he said</a>. ”We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere — it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Canada is opening the door to Chinese automakers. <strong>Canadian prime minister Mark Carney</strong> announced his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chinese-evs-inch-closer-to-the-us-as-canada-slashes-tariffs/\">Sean O’Kane reports</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">”<em>Got a tip for us to share in the Little Bird section?

While X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarweb’s data shows that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android as of January 7, 2026, after months of growth, while X has 125 million daily active users on mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This appears to be the result of longer-term trends, rather than a reaction to the recent X controversies, where users were discovered using the platform’s integrated AI, Grok, to create non-consensual nude images of women, including, sometimes minors. Concern around the deepfake images has now prompted California’s attorney general <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to open an investigation</a> into Grok, following similar investigations by other regions, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy875j28k0o\">like the UK</a>, EU, India, Brazil, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mashable.com/article/countries-blocking-grok-for-explicit-deepfakes\">many more</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The drama on X also led social networking startup Bluesky <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/bluesky-rolls-out-cashtags-and-live-badges-amid-a-boost-in-app-installs/\">to see an increase</a> in app installs in recent days.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083472\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png 889w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=768,472 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=430,264 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=720,442 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=800,491 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=668,410 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=611,375 611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=708,435 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/threads-x-similarweb.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, Threads’ boost in daily mobile usage may be driven by other factors, including cross-promotions from Meta’s larger social apps like Facebook and Instagram (where Threads is regularly advertised to existing users), its focus on creators, and the rapid rollout of new features. Over the past year, Threads has added features like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/threads-takes-on-x-with-new-communities-feature/\">interest-based communities</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/threads-now-lets-you-approve-and-filter-your-replies/\">better filters</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/threads-gets-its-own-dms-as-app-distances-itself-from-instagram/\">DMs</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/threads-tests-a-way-to-share-long-form-text-on-the-platform/\">long-form text</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/threads-adds-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours-and-responses-go-to-dms/\">disappearing posts</a>, and has recently been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/threads-is-developing-in-message-games/\">spotted testing games</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Combined, the daily active user increases suggest that more people are using Threads on mobile as a more regular habit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Meta’s official numbers, the tech giant said in August 2025 that Threads had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/threads-now-has-more-than-400-million-monthly-active-users/\">reached over 400 million monthly</a> active users. The company subsequently reported <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/threads-now-lets-you-approve-and-filter-your-replies/\">in October</a> of last year that Threads had 150 million daily active users.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The growth trends have been continuing for many months. Similarweb <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/threads-is-nearing-xs-daily-app-users-new-data-shows/\">last summer reported</a> that Threads was closing the gap with X on mobile devices after seeing 127.8% year-over-year growth as of late June 2025. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Relatedly, Similarweb observed that X is still ahead of Threads in the U.S., but the gap is narrowing. A year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Threads has little traction on the web while X maintains a fairly steady web audience with around 150 million daily web visits, according to Similarweb data. As of earlier this week (January 13), X was seeing 145.4 million daily web visits, while Threads saw 8.5 million daily web visits across Threads.com and Threads.net combined.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083471\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png 892w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=680,412 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=430,260 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=720,436 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=800,484 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=668,404 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=619,375 619w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=708,429 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/x-threads-web-similarweb.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The plan <em>had</em> been that each employee of YC-backed <a href=\"https://www.bucket.bot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bucket Robotics</a> would carry parts of their booth in their luggage to the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. But CEO and founder Matt Puchalski didn’t want to take the chance that one (or all) of their flights would be delayed. So he rented a Hyundai Santa Fe and packed it up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was… it was tight,” he said with a laugh on the show floor.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took 12 hours driving in the rain, but the gear – and Puchalski – made it safely to Las Vegas, and so began the young company’s first-ever CES.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">San Francisco-based Bucket Robotics was just one of thousands of companies exhibiting at the annual tech conference, a speck of sand on a beach full of products and promises. But despite its modest setup in the automotive-focused West Hall, Puchalski said the trip was worth it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Part of that was a willingness to be tireless, observant, and always ready to pitch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An engineer by trade, Puchalski spent most of the last decade working on autonomous vehicles at Uber, Argo AI, Ford’s subsidiary Latitude AI, and SoftBank-backed Stack AV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At those jobs, Puchalski developed deep connections in the automotive industry, and we crossed paths all week.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There he was at an industry networking party one night. On another night, in my hotel lobby at 10 p.m., he was debating how to balance quality and manufacturing yield with Sanjay Dastoor — founder of mobility startups Skip and Boosted, both of which also got off the ground at YC.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But I first ran into Puchalski during breakfast at the hotel. Seated at the table next to me, he and sales associate Max Joseph were running through preparations for the conference’s “Media Day” over (allegedly) cage-free eggs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Puchalski’s verve piqued my interest, and after making an intro, he told me what Bucket Robotics is up to. Before I knew it, he had cracked open a bright yellow Pelican case and I was holding a small piece of plastic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Started as part of YC’s Spring 2024 batch, Bucket Robotics is all about using advanced vision systems to do quality inspections, specifically for surfaces. The goal is to automate a menial task that Puchalski joked is usually done by “dudes in Wisconsin,” and to accelerate the broad, multi-industry effort to onshore manufacturing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One example Puchalski offered was car door handles. It’s a part customers touch every day, so it needs to be structurally sound, and that kind of quality inspection is basically solved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it can be challenging to make sure the surface is flawless. Is the color right? Are there any burn or scuff marks? These are the questions Bucket Robotics wants to answer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s deeply hard to automate these types of challenges without huge volumes of data, so auto manufacturers just throw dudes in Wisconsin at this problem,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bucket Robotics solves that data problem by working from the CAD files for a particular part. It then generates a bunch of simulated defects – burn marks, bumps, breaks – so that its vision software can detect those problems quickly on a production line.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s no need for manual labeling, and the company claims its models can deploy “in minutes” while also adapting if products or production lines change. One of the big selling points to date is that Bucket Robotics can integrate into existing production lines without adding new hardware, Puchalski said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This has already attracted customers in automotive and in defense, setting up Bucket Robotics to pursue the increasingly popular path of becoming a “dual-use” company.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the show floor opened, the first two hours were “intense,” Puchalski said. Attendees in suits snooped around the startup’s tables, plucked orange stickers with the Bucket Robotics logo, and quizzed the employees about their tech.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More importantly, Puchalski said the level of interest stayed consistent throughout the week. He had “real technical discussions” with people from the worlds of manufacturing, robotics, and automation. He said Friday that he’s spent the week since the show on follow-up calls with prospective customers and investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CES can be a slog, but Bucket Robotics survived. Now comes the actual hard part: building a business, scaling, fundraising, and striking commercial deals.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for the “dudes in Wisconsin,” Puchalski doesn’t see his company as a threat to their livelihoods. Those jobs are just as much about spotting defects as they are about identifying the root cause of the problem, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And besides, Puchalski added, automating surface quality inspection is something that the manufacturing industry has been trying to do for decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So when we go to our customers, it’s incredibly exciting,” he said. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s difficult to use one without sharing personal information, which is retained by the model’s parent company. With OpenAI <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/\">already testing advertising</a>, it’s easy to imagine the same data collection that fuels Facebook and Google creeping into your chatbot conversations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A new project, launched in December by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike, is showing what a privacy-conscious AI service might look like. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://confer.to/\">Confer</a> is designed to look and feel like ChatGPT or Claude, but the backend is arranged to avoid data collection, with the open-source rigor that makes Signal so trusted. Your Confer conversations can’t be used to train the model or target ads, for the simple reason that the host will never have access to them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For Marlinspike, those protections are a response to the intimate nature of the service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s a form of technology that actively invites confession,” says Marlinspike. “Chat interfaces like ChatGPT know more about people than any other technology before. When you combine that with advertising, it’s like someone paying your therapist to convince you to buy something.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ensuring that privacy requires several different systems working in concert. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">First, Confer encrypts messages to and from the system using <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://confer.to/blog/2025/12/passkey-encryption/\">the WebAuthn passkey system</a>. (Unfortunately, that standard works best on mobile devices or Macs running Sequoia, although you can also make it work on Windows or Linux with a password manager.) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://confer.to/blog/2026/01/private-inference/\">On the server side</a>, all Confer’s inference processing is done in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), with remote attestation systems in place to verify the system hasn’t been compromised. Inside that, there’s an array of open-weight foundation models handling whatever query comes in. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is a lot more complicated than a standard inference setup (which is fairly complicated already), but it delivers on Confer’s basic promise to users. As long as those protections are in place, you can have sensitive conversations with the model without any information leaking out.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Confer’s free tier is limited to 20 messages a day and five active chats. Users willing to pay $35 a month will get unlimited access, along with more advanced models and personalization. That’s quite a bit more than ChatGPT’s Plus plan — but privacy doesn’t come cheap.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cabillionairetax.org/\">proposed wealth tax</a> would hit founders on their <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/01/16/business/fine-print-in-californias-wealth-tax-roils-silicon-valley/\">voting shares</a> rather than the actual equity they own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Take Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2026/01/17/leave-b-billionaire-tax-backlash-spreading-far-beyond-billionaires/\">The San Francisco Standard this week</a>. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the resistance is fierce and bipartisan.

Rather than robots doing the work as Bezos envisioned, Bruey said that within 15 to 20 years, it will be cheaper to send a “working-class human” to orbit for a month than to develop better machines.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the moment, few in the tech-forward audience seemed taken aback at what many might consider a provocative statement about cost savings. But that raised questions for me – and it has certainly raised questions for others – about who, exactly, will be working among the stars, and under what conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To explore these questions, I spoke this week with Mary-Jane Rubenstein, dean of social sciences and professor of religion and science and technology studies at Wesleyan University. Rubenstein is the author of the book <em>Worlds Without End: The Many Lives of the Multiverse</em>, which director Daniel Kwan used as research for the award-winning 2022 film “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” More recently, she’s been examining the ethics of space expansion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubenstein’s response to Bruey’s prediction cuts to a fundamental issue – which is power imbalance.”Workers already have a hard enough time on Earth paying their bills and keeping themselves safe . . . and insured,” she told me. “And that dependence on our employers only increases dramatically when one is dependent on one’s employer not just for a paycheck and sometimes for health care, but also for basic access, to food and to water – and also to air.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her assessment of space as a workplace was pretty direct. While it’s easy to romanticize space as an escape to a pristine frontier where people will float weightlessly among the stars, it’s worth remembering there are no oceans or mountains or chirpy birds in space. It’s “not nice up there,” said Rubenstein. “It is not nice at all.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But worker protections aren’t Rubenstein’s only concern. There’s also the increasingly contentious question of who owns what in space – a legal gray area that’s becoming more problematic as commercial space operations accelerate.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 1967 <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html\">Outer Space Treaty</a> established that no nation could claim sovereignty over celestial bodies. The moon, Mars, asteroids – these are supposed to belong to all of humanity. But in 2015, the U.S. passed the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which says that while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. Silicon Valley got starry-eyed almost immediately; the law opened the door to commercial exploitation of space resources, even as the rest of the world watched with concern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubenstein offers an analogy: It’s like saying you can’t own a house, but you can own everything inside it. Actually, she corrects herself, saying it’s worse than that. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams. Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon. There’s no difference between the stuff the moon contains and the moon itself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Green light red light</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies have been positioning themselves to exploit this framework for some time. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/11/asteroid-mining-startup-astroforge-faces-setbacks-and-successes-on-demonstration-mission/\">AstroForge</a> is pursuing asteroid mining.  <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/the-not-so-secret-anymore-lunar-mining-startup/\">Interlune</a> wants to extract Helium-3 from the moon. The problem is that these aren’t renewable resources. “Once the U.S. takes [the Helium-3], China can’t get it,” says Rubenstein. “Once China takes it, the U.S. can’t get it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The international reaction to that 2015 act was swift. At the 2016 UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) meeting, Russia called the it a unilateral violation of international law. Belgium warned about global economic imbalances. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, the U.S. in 2020 created the Artemis Accords – bilateral agreements with allied nations that formalized the American interpretation of space law, particularly around resource extraction. Countries worried about being left out of the new space economy signed on. There are now 60 signatories, though notably Russia and China are not among them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is grumbling in the background, though. “This is one of those instances of the U.S. setting rules and then asking other people to join in or be left out,” Rubenstein says. The Accords don’t say resource extraction is explicitly legal – just that it doesn’t constitute the “national appropriation” that the Outer Space Treaty forbids. It’s a careful dance around a fraught issue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her proposed solution to addressing it is straightforward if exceedingly unlikely: hand control back to the UN and COPUOS. In the absence of that, she suggests repealing the Wolf Amendment, a 2011 law that essentially bans NASA and other federal agencies from using federal funds to work with China or Chinese-owned companies without explicit FBI certification and Congressional approval. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When people tell Rubenstein that collaboration with China is impossible, she has a ready response: “We’re talking about an industry that is saying things like, ‘It’ll totally be possible to house thousands of people in a space hotel,’ or ‘It’ll be possible within 10 years to ship a million people to Mars, where there’s no air and where the radioactivity will give you cancer in a second and where your blood will boil and your face will fall off.’ If it’s possible to imagine doing those things, I think it is possible to imagine the U.S. talking to China.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubenstein’s broader concern is about what we’re choosing to do with space. She sees the current approach – turning the moon into what she calls “a cosmic gas station,” mining asteroids, establishing warfare capabilities in orbit – as profoundly misguided.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Science fiction has given us different templates for imagining space, she notes. She divides the genre into three broad categories. First, there’s the “conquest” genre, or stories written “in service of the expansion of a nation-state or the expansion of capital,” treating space as the next frontier to conquer, just as European explorers once viewed new continents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s dystopian science fiction, meant as warnings about destructive paths. But here’s where something odd happens: “Some tech companies seem to sort of miss the joke in this dystopian genre and just sort of actualize whatever the warning was,” she says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third strand uses space to imagine alternative societies with different ideas of justice and care –  what Rubenstein calls “speculative fiction” in a “high-tech key,” meaning they use futuristic technological settings as their framework.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When it first became clear which template was dominating actual space development (fully in the conquest category), she got depressed. “This seemed to me a real missed opportunity for extending the values and priorities that we have in this world into those realms that we have previously reserved for thinking in different kinds of ways.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubenstein isn’t expecting dramatic policy shifts anytime soon, but she sees some realistic paths forward. One is tightening environmental regulations for space actors; as she notes, we’re only beginning to understand how rocket emissions and re-entering debris affect the ozone layer we spent decades repairing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A more promising opportunity, though, is space debris. With more than <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\">40,000 trackable objects</a> now circling Earth at 17,000 miles per hour, we’re approaching the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\">Kessler effect</a> – a runaway collision scenario that could make orbit unusable for any future launches. “Nobody wants that,” she says. “The U.S. government doesn’t want that. China doesn’t want it. The industry doesn’t want it.” It’s rare to find an issue where every stakeholder’s interests align perfectly, but “space garbage is bad for everybody,” she notes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She’s now working on a proposal for an annual conference bringing together academics, NASA representatives, and industry figures to discuss how to approach space “mindfully, ethically, collaboratively.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether anyone will listen is another question. There certainly doesn’t seem to be much motivation to come together on the issue. In fact, back in July of last year, Congress <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4360\">introduced legislation</a> to make the Wolf Amendment permanent, which would entrench restrictions on China cooperation rather than loosen them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the background, startup founders are projecting major changes in space within five to ten years, companies are positioning themselves to mine asteroids and the moon, and Bruey’s prediction about blue-collar workers in orbit hangs in the air, unanswered.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The judicial orders will allow three projects to resume construction: Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off — you guessed it — Virginia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The developers each filed lawsuits shortly after the Trump administration issued the stop work order, which had been effective for 90 days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When announcing the halt just days before Christmas, the government cited concerns the wind farms would interfere with radar operations. It’s a valid concern, and one the government and project developers grappled with throughout the siting and permitting process. Wind farms can be located to minimize disruption to existing radar facilities, and the radar equipment itself can be upgraded to filter out noise generated by whirling turbine blades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">President Trump himself has made it no secret that he’s not a fan of offshore wind: “I’m not much of a windmill person,” he told oil executives <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/01/09/trump-assails-windmills-and-wind-energy-as-junk-theyre-losers/88108694007/\">last week</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In early hearings, judges weren’t impressed with the government’s line of reasoning. In three separate courtrooms in Virginia and Washington, DC, the Trump administration’s arguments were met with skepticism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, pointed out the government failed to address several of plaintiff Equinor’s arguments in its lawsuit. Equinor, which is developing Empire Wind, had alleged the Interior department’s order was “arbitrary and capricious.” “Your brief doesn’t even include the word arbitrary,” Nichols said, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-offshore-wind-energy-climate-lawsuits-370884367bf3c15556dee43495cf11d9\">according</a> to the Associated Press.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nichols also questioned why the Trump administration was asking for construction to be halted when its main concern regarding national security appeared to be over the operation of the wind farm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">U.S. District Judge Jamar Walker, who heard Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind developer Dominion Energy’s lawsuit, questioned the government along a similar line. He also said the Interior department’s order was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pilotonline.com/2026/01/16/dominion-wind-farm-judge-rules/\">overly broad</a> when viewed in context of the Virginia project.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two projects remain in limbo as their lawsuits work their way through the courts. Ørsted, which is developing Sunrise Wind, has a hearing scheduled for February 2, while Vineyard Wind 1’s developers only filed their lawsuit on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The East Coast could deliver up to 110 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2050, according to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-reports-chart-path-east-coast-offshore-wind-support-reliable-affordable-electricity\">Department of Energy study</a> published in 2024. That would provide a significant boost to some of the most densely populated cities — and data center regions — in the country. The Northeast currently has some of the highest electricity costs in the nation, while the Mid-Atlantic’s grid operator has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/trump-administration-wants-tech-companies-to-buy-15b-of-power-plants-they-may-not-use/\">recently come under fire</a> for rising electricity prices in its territory. Offshore wind, as one of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.lazard.com/media/uounhon4/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2025.pdf\">cheapest forms</a> of new generating capacity, has the potential to slow or reverse the trend.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potential is even bigger when viewed on a national scale. Offshore wind could generate <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/offshore-wind-research-and-development\">13,500 terawatt-hours</a> of electricity per year, which is three times more than the U.S. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/use-of-electricity.php\">currently consumes</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

She, like everyone else that has tried this challenge, was unsuccessful.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I realized half the reason that all of these attempts were failing is, number one, obviously it’s hard to make micro-robots survive on the ocean,” Laverack told TechCrunch. “But number two, they don’t have enough data on the ocean to know what the weather is or even know what the ocean conditions are like.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laverack set out for different conferences, like Oceanology International, to find this missing ocean data. She quickly realized that no one had really figured out a good way to collect it yet. Instead, she found people asking if they could pay her to try to collect the data herself. She figured that if people were willing to pay her for this data, she could try to build a way to capture it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those conversations were the basis for Oshen, which Laverack founded alongside Ciaran Dowds, an electrical engineer, in April 2022. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company now builds fleets of autonomous micro-robots, called C-Stars, that can survive in the ocean for 100 days straight and are deployed in swarms to collect ocean data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Oshen started small. Laverack said she and Dowds chose not to pursue venture capital right away when launching the company. Instead, they combined their savings to buy a 25-foot sailboat, lived at the cheapest marina in the United Kingdom, and used the vessel as their testing platform while getting the company off the ground.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For two years, Oshen would iterate on the bots on shore and immediately take them out on the water to test them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the summer, that’s not too bad,” Laverack said. “The problem is you really need your boats to work in all seasons. When your robot breaks, [and] it’s a winter storm that’s raging, a 25-foot sailboat shouldn’t really be going out in those conditions. So, that led to some adventure, which I wouldn’t say any more about, but there were certainly some interesting events there.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Getting the tech just right was difficult, Laverack said, because it’s not as easy as just taking an existing larger robot and shrinking it down. These bots needed to be mass deployable and cheap despite also needing to be technologically advanced enough to operate and collect data for long periods of time on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many other companies have successfully gotten two of the three correct, Laverack said. Oshen’s ability to get all three started to attract customers across defense and government organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company caught the attention of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) two years ago, but Laverack said that their tech just wasn’t ready to be deployed reliably yet. The organization reached back out two months before the 2025 hurricane season after Oshen had successfully deployed the robots into winter storms in the U.K. This time, Oshen jumped at the chance and quickly built and sent over 15 C-Stars.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Five of these C-Stars were thrown overboard and made their way into position by the U.S. Virgin Islands where NOAA predicted Hurricane Humberto was headed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laverack said they were expecting the bots to just collect data leading up to the storm, but instead, three of the bots were able to weather the entire storm — minus a few missing parts — and collected data the whole time, becoming, she says, the first ocean robot to collect data through a Category 5 hurricane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, the company has moved to a hub for marine tech companies in Plymouth, England, and has started racking up contracts with customers, including the U.K. government, for both weather and defense operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Laverack said the company plans to raise venture capital soon to keep up with demand.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations in high-stakes disputes, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you’re wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk’s investment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wazzan’s analysis combines Musk’s initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI’s early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/\">27% chunk</a> of the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn’t really about the money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk’s personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world’s richest person. As Reuters <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/elon-musk-becomes-first-person-worth-700-billion-after-court-ruling-pay-package-2025-12-20/\">recently noted</a>, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes’ billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Against this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk’s wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/15/openai-to-investors-expect-deliberately-outlandish-claims-from-musk.html\">reportedly sent a letter</a> Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, Calif., about 15 miles east of San Francisco.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “<a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/the-merge-ethereum.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Merge</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Runpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Back in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, they <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/t8dn5r/request_runpodio_offering_free_gpu_time_in_return/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted</a> in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bootstrapping-growth\">Bootstrapping growth</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, their user base was growing on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RunPod/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/runpod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Discord</a>, especially after ChatGPT launched.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">VCs were also on the prowl for investments. Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/coreweave-co-founder-explains-how-a-closet-of-crypto-mining-gpus-led-to-a-1-5b-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI cloud services that began as crypto miners</a>, these founders refused to take on debt, they said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508053225/en/RunPod-Raises-%2420M-in-Seed-Funding-Co-led-by-Intel-Capital-and-Dell-Technologies-Capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a $20 million seed deal</a> co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Competition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu said.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Friday, the government followed up by sending a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding that it take immediate action to stop the production of nonconsensual intimate images and CSAM — child sexual abuse material.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Today, I sent xAI a cease-and-desist letter, demanding the company immediately stop the creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual, intimate images and child sexual abuse material,” said California AG Rob Bonta in a <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-xai-demands-it-halt-illegal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>. “The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to immediately comply. California has zero tolerance for [CSAM].”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AG’s office additionally claimed that xAI appeared to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual nudes, the likes of which are being “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” The agency said it expects xAI to prove that it is taking steps to address these issues within the next five days. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the heart of the backlash is Grok’s “spicy” mode feature, which xAI created to generate explicit content. The issue has spread beyond California; Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, and Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/\">blocked the platform</a> altogether. Despite xAI instituting some restrictions on its image-editing features <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/musk-says-unaware-grok-generating-explicit-images-minors-2026-01-14/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">late Wednesday</a>, the California AG’s office moved ahead with its cease-and-desist letter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X’s safety account has previously <a href=\"https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">denounced</a> this kind of user activity, saying: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” TechCrunch reached out to xAI for comment and was met with an automated email that says “Legacy Media Lies.” TC also reached out to the California AG’s office for more context.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The advent of free generative AI tools has led to a disturbing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/\">swell of non-consensual sexual material</a>.

The platform offered episodes under 10 minutes featuring popular Hollywood actors, but failed to gain traction and was shut down six months later.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ReelShort and DramaBox succeeded where Quibi failed because while Quibi tried to compress Hollywood TV into shorter episodes, ReelShort and DramaBox created low-budget stories that hook viewers within the first few seconds, followed by continuous cliffhangers, all featuring non-union talent. Additionally, they target fans of soapy romance and revenge thriller stories, while Quibi tried to target everyone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok is now looking to replicate this success with PineDrama.

Traditional techniques, like <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/an-overview-of-high-throughput-screening-71561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">high-throughput screening</a>, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/openai-backed-biotech-firm-chai-discovery-raises-130m-series-b-at-1-3b-valuation/\">completed its Series B</a>, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260108131261/en/Chai-Discovery-Announces-Collaboration-with-Eli-Lilly-and-Company-to-Accelerate-Biologics-Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">deal</a> in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-eli-lilly-announce-1-billion-investment-in-ai-drug-discovery-lab-163446796.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">on a $1 billion partnership</a> to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry isn’t <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/20/schrodinger-ramy-farid-drug-discovery-ai-physics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">without its detractors</a>. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uQDgLakjns4?si=xcf5QX0phrLqu5uG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unlikely to have a major impact</a>. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of <a href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/stories/our-investment-in-chai-discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Chai’s major backers</a> — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chai may have been founded less than two years ago, but the startup’s origins began around six years ago, amid conversations between its co-founders and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. One of those founders, Josh Meier, previously worked for OpenAI in 2018 on its research and engineering team. After he left the company, Altman messaged Meier’s old college friend, Jack Dent, to ask about a potential business opportunity. Meier and Dent had originally met in computer science classes at Harvard but, at the time, Dent was a Stripe engineer (another company Altman was an early backer of). Altman asked him if he thought Meier would be open to collaborating on a proteomics startup — that is, a company focused on the study of proteins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Altman “messaged me to say that everyone at OpenAI thought highly of him and asked if I thought he’d be open to working with them on a proteomics spinout,” Dent said. Dent told Altman “of course,” but there was just one hitch: Meier didn’t feel like the technology was quite “there” yet. The AI tech behind such firms — which leverage powerful algorithms — was still a growing field and far from where it needed to be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meier was also pretty dead set on joining Facebook’s research and engineering team, which is what he would go on to do. At Facebook, Meier helped to develop <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/622803v4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ESM1</a>, the first transformer protein-language model — an important precursor to the work Chai is currently doing. After Meier’s time at Facebook, he would spend three years at Absci, another AI biotech firm based around drug creation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2024, Meier and Dent finally felt prepared to tackle the proteomics company they had originally discussed with Altman. “Josh and I reached back out to Sam and told him we should pick up that conversation where we left off — and that we were starting Chai together,” Dent said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI ended up becoming one of Chai’s first seed investors. Meier and Dent actually founded Chai — along with their co-founders, Matthew McPartlon and Jacques Boitreaud — while working out of the AI giant’s offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. “They were kind enough to give us some office space,” Dent revealed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, a little over a year later, as Chai basks in the glow of its newfound partnership with Eli Lilly, Dent says that the key to the company’s fast growth has been assembling a team of hugely talented people. “We really just put our heads down and pushed the frontier of what these models are capable of,” said Dent. “Every line of code in our codebase is homegrown. We’re not taking LLMs off the shelf that are in the open source [ecosystem] and fine-tuning them. These are highly custom architectures.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">General Catalyst’s Viboch told TechCrunch that she felt Chai was ready to hit the ground running. “There are no fundamental barriers to deployment of these models in drug discovery,” she said. “Companies will still need to take drug candidates through testing and clinical trials, but we believe there’ll be significant advantages to those who adopt these technologies — not just in compressing discovery timelines, but also in unlocking classes of medicines that have historically been difficult to develop.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Well, there’s one surefire way to do that, and that is through advertising. In the near term, that seems to be the AI giant’s plan, as it announced this week that limited ads are headed to certain ChatGPT users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a> published Friday, OpenAI said that it will begin testing ads in the U.S. for both its free and Go tiers. (Go accounts, which cost $8 a month, were <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced globally</a> on Friday.) The company frames this as a way to sustain free access while generating revenue from people who aren’t ready to commit to a paid subscription. For the time being, the company’s more expensive paid tiers — Pro, Plus, Business, and Enterprise — will not be getting any ads.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ads will appear at the bottom of a user’s conversation and will be targeted to the topic of discussion. Users will have some control over this situation, as they’ll be able to dismiss ads, see explanations for why they’re being shown particular ones, and also turn off personalization, which should defeat the ads’ targeted nature. The company has also made a commitment not to serve ads to users it believes are under the age of 18.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3083447\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png 2070w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=2048,1154 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=1095,617 1095w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-11.05.19-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch (Screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says that ChatGPT will maintain “answer independence,” meaning that, despite the incorporation of advertising, those ads will not influence the answers that the chatbot serves to users. The company has also promised not to sell users’ data to advertisers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This strategy could pay off in two ways. For users of the free and Go tiers, the company obviously stands to make a significant amount of ad revenue. At the same time, there will necessarily be certain users who appreciate the app but don’t appreciate the ads, which could conceivably drive an uptick in subscriptions to the platform’s more expensive accounts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI also wants everybody to know that it’s only sticking ads in its chatbot to help the world.

Electricity rates in 2025 were up about 10% to 15% in the region compared with the year before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the last decade, PJM’s peak load has <a href=\"https://www.monitoringanalytics.com/reports/presentations/2026/IMM_MC_Market_Monitor_Report_20260122.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">increased 10%</a>, according to Monitoring Analytics, and it’s expected to increase another 6.5% in 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The price of natural gas is also to blame. PJM is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel, and the price has soared recently. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, says that about 60% of 2025’s price increases are the result of high prices for fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Grid operators have been put in a bind as data centers have ramped up demand for electricity after more than a decade of zero growth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building new fossil fuel power plants is a years-long proposition costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Many utilities and power providers are hesitant to commit to those timelines and outlays. If the AI boom fizzles, they could be left with unprofitable power plants that are built to operate for decades. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies, which haven’t traditionally been in the power business, have instead been turning to renewables, which are cheaper, more modular, and faster to deploy. Solar and batteries have been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/data-centers-love-solar-heres-a-comprehensive-guide-to-deals-over-100-megawatts/\">an early winner</a>. A typical solar farm can be built in about 18 months, and because it can be built in phases, can start delivering power before it’s complete. That aligns more closely with data center construction, allowing companies to manage risk on similar timelines.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
